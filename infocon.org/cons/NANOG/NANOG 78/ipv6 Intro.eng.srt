1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:05,819
the tutorial attracts committee has

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,340
started up a number of tutorials which

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:15,719
are going to be done this is intro to

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:19,350
ipv6 the target audience that's you are

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:22,980
you comfortable with ipv4 are you

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,789
comfortable with site or notation if yes

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:30,080
you're in the right place clickers a

8
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,460
little bit slow no you might get lost

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:38,099
quick show of hands is everybody here

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,930
savvy ipv4 okay good anybody here a real

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:47,760
ipv6 professional who brought tomatoes

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:51,199
to throw at me all right okay so not

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:56,300
really new Genda but where we're going a

14
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,300
bit of the timeline concepts whatever

15
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:05,610
ipv4 historically is probably the most

16
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,040
used protocol it's actually impossible

17
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,930
to measure how much ipv4 is out there

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,080
simply because so much of its hidden

19
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:17,580
behind that which is in and of itself an

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,740
evil thing big concept that we're going

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:25,020
to touch on is the fact that ipv4

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:29,460
addresses are integers that's right it's

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:32,610
a 32-bit number you can just type ssh 47

24
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,619
and actually connect to something songs

25
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,680
or something yeah 47 2 connected right

26
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:41,490
good normally you'd disappoint them this

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:46,380
quad 255 to a bit everybody happy

28
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:49,199
yeah so what does v6 and what isn't it

29
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,320
it's new its next-generation it's

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:02:01,469
wonderful and it's notes on my laptop

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:04,949
cuz I couldn't print them out first real

32
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,740
old 22 years out there for his public

33
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:11,420
blocks amazingly 1999

34
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,650
design with security in mind in

35
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,799
implemented and hardware it's just as

36
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:20,790
fast if not faster than before which is

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,950
a truly cool thing it's extensible the

38
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:27,540
extensible headers and ipv6 are how you

39
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:32,250
get SR v6 to work is anybody in here

40
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:35,250
segment routing person okay one segment

41
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,320
routing person so basically the segment

42
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,360
routing v6 you stuff all of your extra

43
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,530
address information on your path into a

44
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:47,130
second header and how it goes

45
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:51,090
and there are several migration aids you

46
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:54,200
can encapsulate ipv6 datagrams in ipv4

47
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,790
to traverse them over an ipv4 network

48
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:08,820
that's tunneling everybody's familiar

49
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:17,310
with the concept of tunneling I hope it

50
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:19,109
next room over so ipv6 has one real

51
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,120
strike going against it at this point

52
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,330
and that's people just don't know about

53
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:29,010
it yet but it's got many things going

54
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:33,510
for it and the big thing that's going

55
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:36,899
for ipv6 well there's this little

56
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:39,239
problem of population if you look at the

57
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,489
population of the earth it's a about

58
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,180
three and a half billion people at this

59
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,530
point give or take a bit yesterday

60
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,000
somebody was saying there are four

61
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,660
billion Internet users

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,670
I believe it the only problem is if you

63
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,390
actually do all the math and subtract

64
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:59,309
out all the bogans and everything else

65
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:03,809
there's only about three billion use of

66
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:07,260
ipv4 addresses so the biggest feature is

67
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,900
space there's a lot of it ok everybody

68
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,019
has a metaphor this is mine some people

69
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:17,160
use the grains of sand on a beach the

70
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:21,120
number of stars whatever you can work it

71
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,340
out but it's 128-bit long number

72
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:29,610
which is really kind of hard to do as a

73
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:33,710
decimal and it's some big three point

74
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,550
four times 10 to the 38th undecillion

75
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:39,859
it's a number you just can't wrap your

76
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:42,210
head around it so big but right now

77
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:46,320
we've only allocated a very small

78
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,969
fraction of it it's still about two to

79
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,389
the hundred and twenty-fifth available

80
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:56,430
spaces after what's been allocated so

81
00:04:53,389 --> 00:05:00,030
formatting everybody here is familiar

82
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:02,669
with ipv4 addressing ipv6 addresses are

83
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:07,109
a little bit of a different layout too

84
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:08,820
much longer you'd never have to type an

85
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,889
ipv6 address unless you're doing manual

86
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:15,300
configuration hopefully that's what DNS

87
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:21,620
is all about everybody here do dual

88
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:25,400
stack DNS anybody do dual stack DNS okay

89
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:29,690
that's okay because either ipv4 or ipv6

90
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:34,500
DNS can resolve either ipv4 or ipv6

91
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:36,000
addresses really nifty that whole

92
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,450
addresses are representatives eight

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,190
groups of X digits

94
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:46,289
there's a long number show quick show of

95
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:50,160
hands is that a number that you want to

96
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:55,490
read or work with hands up for yes hands

97
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:58,440
up for now oh good everybody's saying

98
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:07,440
and cider notation everybody's

99
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:11,969
comfortable cider notation okay so ipv6

100
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,630
gzip anyone okay so you're off you're

101
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:25,440
all familiar weather moose is moose

102
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:26,130
moose gzip okay some of these are gonna

103
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,800
be good

104
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:34,290
so in readability all alphas in the G's

105
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,810
v6 address are lower cased by definition

106
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:41,190
this is actually defined in RFC number

107
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,930
RFC number something asked me later or

108
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,360
download the presentation all the notes

109
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,190
are in it and you're probably going to

110
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,140
want to download it because some charts

111
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,340
in here that if you take pictures of

112
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,300
them they're not gonna look very good

113
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:56,429
but they'll be great in the PowerPoint

114
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,750
there are lots of zeros we can get rid

115
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,260
of them and there were rules about

116
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,360
getting rid of them leading zeros in a

117
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:09,480
block that one can be suppressed they

118
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:11,340
must be suppressed you just read it but

119
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,310
basically the bottom line is you can

120
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:19,229
take a lot of zeros and using a token of

121
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:20,850
two colons get rid of them by convention

122
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,390
you're supposed to get rid of as many

123
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,370
zeros as you can if perchance there are

124
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:29,370
two blocks of the same number of zeros

125
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:32,040
in an ipv6 address you compress the

126
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:36,780
first one and you always get rid of

127
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:39,030
leading zeros so that is what it comes

128
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,390
up to when you're done does that address

129
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:44,659
you can deal with okay so it's not that

130
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,659
bad

131
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:52,650
there are footnotes you'll get that

132
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:56,010
later sometimes as a migration aid you

133
00:07:52,650 --> 00:08:00,450
may want to embed an ipv4 address inside

134
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:07,349
an ipv6 address it's defined in RFC you

135
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:10,590
can do it I give you i pv for ipv6 same

136
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:14,010
thing very often used by people who are

137
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,529
adding ipv6 to an existing ipv4 backbone

138
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,089
and

139
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:23,149
or whatever reason don't want to do a

140
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:27,139
proper ipv6 address matrix or if you

141
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:31,759
want to use the ipv4 address as an index

142
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:34,999
you can do it the compressed F colon

143
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:42,099
colon F F is used for before v6 routing

144
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:49,839
let's do that fairly often so 3 times

145
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:49,839
256 addresses unicast you your unicast

146
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:57,379
anycast different nodes goes the top

147
00:08:54,769 --> 00:09:00,139
watch when your address so if you you

148
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:02,839
you you and you are in any caste and I

149
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:04,309
send something to any caste it'll get to

150
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:13,850
the first any caste node which would be

151
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:16,100
you know simple right multicast groups

152
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,589
are dresses they'll belong to different

153
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,660
nodes but you could have multicast

154
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:23,120
addresses multiple multicast addresses

155
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,779
on one physical interface that get

156
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,059
addressed as parts of separate groups

157
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:31,309
traffic is sent to all nodes in a

158
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:33,439
multicast group that are accessible as

159
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:36,800
opposed to any caste which will just be

160
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:43,629
the topologically closest sort of like

161
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:46,969
that macbook person in third row okay

162
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:50,930
curveball time has to be a sports

163
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,309
reference okay no broadcast would

164
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:59,599
everybody like to get rid of broadcast

165
00:09:52,309 --> 00:10:01,429
forms okay get rid of before you know V

166
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,809
porno broadcast no broadcaster various

167
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:11,660
storms is that not a good enough reason

168
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:14,059
just to move to v6 by itself okay so no

169
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,519
broadcast means no ARP and we'll touch

170
00:10:14,059 --> 00:10:19,550
on how that's done later but there is no

171
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:23,829
ARP but there is a way to map from MAC

172
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,829
address which still exists ipv6

173
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:44,309
quick reference sorry my laptop walked

174
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:46,379
up on me this is a quick reference chart

175
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:50,219
don't bother taking pictures of it you

176
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:52,040
can download it I don't even think I

177
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:57,110
stole this from anybody

178
00:10:52,040 --> 00:11:00,839
so unspecified loopback IPP for mapped

179
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:04,829
multicast you can tell what a multicast

180
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,959
is by the prefix neat isn't it by

181
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:10,638
definition we know that that's multicast

182
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:14,910
address link-local which we'll get to

183
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:18,480
also defined unique local address think

184
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:22,939
of the unique local address as RFC 1918

185
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,559
address space kinda-sorta

186
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:28,050
one of the neat things about v6 is that

187
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:31,139
you can have many unicast addresses on

188
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:34,559
one interface and based on routing

189
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:39,120
you'll go in or out of the same thing so

190
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:41,279
you can think of a ula as 1918 space but

191
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,529
you can also overlay public space on the

192
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,889
same interface and easily go back and

193
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:49,920
forth one of the features that makes b6

194
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:51,269
better than before and I'm sorry it

195
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,209
didn't have the right picture I want to

196
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:55,949
get a really cool v6 engine and just you

197
00:11:54,209 --> 00:12:00,059
know do the transformation from before

198
00:11:55,949 --> 00:12:02,149
to b6 but couldn't get that done site

199
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:07,679
local addressing has been deprecated

200
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:09,149
that was the predecessor to ula you can

201
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,749
still use them if you were using them

202
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:16,170
but don't use them new places make sense

203
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:19,079
and finally global unicast which is

204
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:22,709
everything else I think I happened on

205
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:24,628
there yeah so some references and an

206
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,758
important feature how do you tell a

207
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:31,920
unicast address from an anycast address

208
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:35,879
in v6 you can't it's defined by the you

209
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,170
outing it's a little bit deep of the

210
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:38,320
concept so we're not going to hit it

211
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:42,339
here

212
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,660
but you can have a unicast address that

213
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:46,300
looks like in anycast address because

214
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,160
it's the same thing that's one of those

215
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:52,870
mind twisters took me a while to get

216
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:56,709
wrap my head around it any kiss doesn't

217
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:59,290
actually exist in before and it's a kind

218
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,638
of picked on done with routing tricks so

219
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,589
you announced the same route from

220
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,269
multiple places and then your routing

221
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:07,180
protocol will say oh you're the closest

222
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:10,750
one and that's why you set your resolver

223
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:15,040
to quad 9 8 10 8 10 8 and a 2 day today

224
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:19,560
- not even 4 4 4 - 2 or whatever that

225
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,560
really simple one is that cloth or does

226
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:29,680
a little bit of a breather in a recap

227
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:34,029
you've seen mm 1 DB 8 32 used

228
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:38,079
extensively that is a prefix which is

229
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:43,959
reserved for documentation just sort of

230
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:46,899
like 190 2.0 2.0 and if you ever come

231
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:49,329
across a mall where you're shopping it

232
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:50,500
you want to get on their Wi-Fi and they

233
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:54,729
say enter an email address

234
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:56,829
well Jay Q public at example.com is a

235
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:00,449
reserved domain which never resolved to

236
00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:02,680
anywhere it's reserved for documentation

237
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:04,680
very few people actually check for

238
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,819
example.com and their front-end parser

239
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:11,109
and it's the old trick if you don't want

240
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:14,790
to give your address away three

241
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:18,850
fundamental difference no broadcast

242
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:20,920
packet fragmentation can only occur at

243
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:24,310
the logical ends if you were here for

244
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,819
Paul Weber's mins DNS talk yesterday was

245
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:32,619
anybody here for that ok so Paul was

246
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:35,229
talking about why you can't globally

247
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,569
filter ICMP for DNS because of packet

248
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,639
sizes well that's the reasons you can't

249
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:42,639
fragment in the middle like you can with

250
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:46,120
ipv4 whatever goes in the wire has to

251
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:50,230
come out of the wire and PM tud path MTU

252
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:53,320
daemon uses an ICMP command to say hey

253
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:58,060
guys how big is my path so that the ends

254
00:14:53,320 --> 00:15:00,300
can fragment if necessary and there's

255
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:03,989
magic non-routable tereska link-local

256
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:06,910
which is wonderful and useful and

257
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:07,620
non-routable we'll see about that in a

258
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:12,610
minute

259
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:14,470
so breathe and at this point we're gonna

260
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,810
take three minutes if anybody has any

261
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:21,720
direct questions it's built into the

262
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:32,890
schedule everybody's good we can move on

263
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:35,860
great and variable so eui-64 is the

264
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:38,590
basis of function now everybody here is

265
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:41,670
happy with site or address format so

266
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:48,040
you're used to having a slash 32 is one

267
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:56,650
address well in ipv6 slash 32 is a lot

268
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:58,870
of space and you won't be able to get

269
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:01,720
there and the way to get there on an

270
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:04,120
Ethernet is by taking the Ethernet MAC

271
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,860
address which somebody has paid the I

272
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,340
Triple E a lot of money for the use of

273
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,080
and if they're intelligent they don't

274
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:14,530
have a 6 in their MAC address because we

275
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:17,470
know what that breaks if you are an MPLS

276
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:22,300
person know how having a 6 to your mac

277
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:25,470
breaks MPLS there's a magic conversion

278
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:31,240
you take your MAC address you split it

279
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:34,810
down the middle drop it in a fffe which

280
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,520
makes a 64-bit number and then you flip

281
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,260
the seventh most significant bit from a

282
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,740
zero to a one

283
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:46,330
which says I am a local not a universal

284
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:47,890
address and there's an example of it and

285
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:53,320
if you really want to go into the weeds

286
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:56,410
on it go to Wikipedia just Google Google

287
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,530
for eui-64 transform and you'll get lots

288
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:03,209
of examples and a calculator I found

289
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:06,329
there's a link to it in the end

290
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:10,708
so if everybody's happy with that and

291
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:15,059
the / 64 prefix I'm out to you a bit of

292
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:18,899
magic slash 64 is a magic number an ipv6

293
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:20,908
land don't ever let anybody tell you

294
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:23,458
that you don't need to slash 64 of

295
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:29,220
address space it's built into the

296
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:34,350
protocol there's lots of them so link

297
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,880
local you can talk directly to your

298
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:39,178
Ethernet neighbors using link local

299
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:42,570
address without any resolution you can

300
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:44,940
just say I want to talk to link local at

301
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:47,639
the enough and you'll be able to get to

302
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:51,960
it really cool for things like local

303
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,970
printers connecting to any local device

304
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,559
it just advertises its MAC address in

305
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:59,190
magically you're there if you happen to

306
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:02,520
know what it is we have this in the

307
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:05,309
table and you just concatenate it with

308
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,620
the EU i-64 there's your link local

309
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:09,210
address it's a well-known format so if

310
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,939
you know the MAC address of the

311
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:14,520
interface that you're talking to you can

312
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,980
convert that into an eui-64 and one

313
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:20,450
transform and then concatenate it with

314
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:25,080
fe80 colon colon and you have you are

315
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:28,649
when local dress this by the way is a

316
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,779
case where the colon colon token is

317
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:33,559
fixed and everything after that you just

318
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:38,789
suppress zeros in line

319
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:41,760
there's your link local dress and as you

320
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:44,158
see the fffe is in the middle the zero

321
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,460
to zero charlie are in there the second

322
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:50,250
zero charlie is in there and that is a

323
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:54,149
properly formatted visa six address

324
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:56,039
complete with the cider block very

325
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:57,899
useful even if you can't go we're out it

326
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,929
please don't try to globally route it

327
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:06,989
filter it filtering at every place you

328
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:08,659
can possibly filter it okay prefix

329
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,830
length

330
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:12,510
everybody's comfortable cider right

331
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:16,439
because you show up in Cerebus

332
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:19,710
comfortable cider oh good

333
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,000
everybody liked to drink cider slightly

334
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:25,590
different kind yeah

335
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:30,330
good important thing to remember is that

336
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:34,970
the smaller the number on the cider it's

337
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:39,320
the larger the block so if you have they

338
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:42,330
choose thousand one DBH so : : / 32

339
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:47,279
that's a whole lot bigger than a 2001

340
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:54,570
DBA : : / 48 so we're gonna build

341
00:19:47,279 --> 00:20:00,269
upwards 48 is important even though a 48

342
00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:02,279
is a huge amount of space it's kind of

343
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:05,820
like a 250 it's kind of like a / 24 in

344
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:08,159
v4 land what's the smallest block you

345
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:14,370
can inject into the public ipv4 routing

346
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:15,990
tables anybody select 24 right / 48 is

347
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:20,039
the smallest block you can inject into

348
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:24,029
the public ipv6 tables and for people

349
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:25,649
who are doing routed to any caste / 40

350
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:28,049
is what you have to do for your router

351
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:34,168
to any caste so if you look at the

352
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:37,168
public v6 servers there 48 32 is your

353
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:39,899
default allocation for an ISP or in the

354
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:43,019
United States bro highest peace here for

355
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:45,899
the most part so / 32 is what Aaron give

356
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:49,380
you right will also give you a 32 as

357
00:20:45,899 --> 00:20:52,139
your initial delegation other are ours

358
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:58,010
do different things for ISPs the rules

359
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:58,010
are entirely different for end-users and

360
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:07,889
there's a link in the whatever the thing

361
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:13,019
is at the end that has the iron rules in

362
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:15,029
it so you good Rick with that and how

363
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,720
many people here aren't ISPs it should

364
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:17,720
be a smaller number

365
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:25,840
does everybody assign a slash 48 for

366
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:29,460
every customer good you think about the

367
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:33,250
fact that a slash 48 is the amount of

368
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:35,680
subnets that slash 16 is of individual

369
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:39,280
ipv4 addresses it's starting to get a

370
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:46,960
feel for the size of this so why keep

371
00:21:39,280 --> 00:22:05,470
out later and all the public addresses

372
00:21:46,960 --> 00:22:07,720
assigned so far in 2000/2001 ow a 48 is

373
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,160
the smallest block you can inject that's

374
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:14,260
the smallest block you should give every

375
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:18,400
customer you know sometimes you will use

376
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:20,470
a 56 or 64 an individual customer that

377
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,650
for whatever reason isn't getting

378
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,240
directly injected into the public tables

379
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:27,190
if you are directly connecting someone

380
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,930
Annotated Center to a top of racks which

381
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:35,680
perhaps you would give them a 56 or 60 /

382
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:37,410
64 is the normal land allocation you

383
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,920
don't actually want to go to anything

384
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:43,810
shorter than a 64 from normal purposes

385
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:46,240
because as somebody who's a lot smarter

386
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:48,730
than I am told me recently the Broadcom

387
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,220
trident chipset which is one basic

388
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:53,560
building blocks of chipsets is actually

389
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:57,240
hard were optimized to switch on / 64 so

390
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:59,080
I don't know how true that is but

391
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,870
considering the pedigree of the guy who

392
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,220
told me I trust him he's one of the

393
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:07,300
chief architects someone's switch

394
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:10,450
companies there are 64 thousand of them

395
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:12,940
in a / 48 so you can just afford to give

396
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,010
people a / 64 as a matter of fact you

397
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:20,260
can afford to a science / 64 to each

398
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:21,970
post if you were so inclined well that's

399
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,060
actually a cool thing to do because you

400
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:27,460
can have multiple unique unicast

401
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,950
addresses assigned to each physical

402
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,669
interface on each host so you may as

403
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:37,960
well give them some elbow room

404
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:40,740
everybody cool with concept great we'll

405
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:49,510
talk about why in a bit

406
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:50,890
point points there's an RFC oh I thought

407
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,960
I had my notes I guess I don't

408
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:55,450
anyway there's no RFC that says you

409
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,309
should use a slash 64 is your basic VLAN

410
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:03,429
or your basic host and a slash 127 as

411
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:06,820
your basic point point I can't think of

412
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:11,080
any modern implementation v6 that

413
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:14,860
doesn't support 127 a lot of ISPs will

414
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:17,470
give you a 126 for your ipv6

415
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:24,969
point-to-point that's a legacy of their

416
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:27,820
provisioning system and so you'll still

417
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:33,820
see a lot of ISPs that do that SP for

418
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:36,189
127 it's the right thing to do and they

419
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,379
really shouldn't did pack them inside of

420
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,919
a single slash 64 because though who

421
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:45,400
knows what they'll break in the future

422
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:47,860
look back 128 okay how many people here

423
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,620
have the shirt that says one 27001

424
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:54,610
there's no place like home

425
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:58,120
one two okay you admit it do you have

426
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:59,340
colon colon Jeff colon colon one there's

427
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:03,610
no place like home

428
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:08,668
well colon colon one is your local

429
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:15,158
loopback and there's no place like home

430
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:17,200
so okay if I time this right about 15

431
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:20,860
minutes ago I told you about that

432
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:26,049
curveball no Arps because there's no

433
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:28,860
broadcast has anybody here actually

434
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:32,500
looked at a Wireshark trace of an ARP

435
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:35,350
okay it's really is that simple it's one

436
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,059
packet that says I am who has at the

437
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:40,139
other packet coming back saying yep I've

438
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:40,139
got it you can talk to me now

439
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:43,910
p6 is a little bit more complex than

440
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,710
that

441
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,300
some new mechanism to layer three

442
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:52,610
mechanism called later discover neighbor

443
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:59,149
discovery and with neighbor discovery we

444
00:25:52,610 --> 00:26:01,100
get its humble servants and the

445
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,930
parameter discovery at the bottom which

446
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,520
is your link em to you and your hop

447
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,970
limits which are very important because

448
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:10,670
if you don't know what your link MTU is

449
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:14,120
then you're going to either send

450
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:18,860
something too big there's a minimum 1280

451
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:21,110
and if you block ICMP then you'll never

452
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:24,709
get that it's too big message coming

453
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:26,780
back so don't pluck ICMP capriciously v6

454
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:32,960
really needs it you have to change your

455
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:38,210
mindset with your firewalling okay it's

456
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:42,130
a directed multicast yeah I'm not gonna

457
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:47,990
read it it's there it's what it is

458
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:54,470
and there are three pieces

459
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:56,040
Deborah solicitation and do booking

460
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,720
address

461
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:01,500
one of the interesting things about v6

462
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,910
is that you can automatically configure

463
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,309
so really one of the first things you do

464
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:08,350
in your neighbor detection did you go

465
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:13,210
out and say does anybody else have this

466
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:15,189
duplicate already again I'm not going

467
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:18,540
into the weeds will come Wikipedia

468
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:18,540
there's a really good description of it

469
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:28,540
router solicitations ipv6 routers say

470
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:30,760
I'm here every three minutes gives you

471
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:32,678
the sixty-four prefixes and come to you

472
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:36,280
et cetera and whether it's a default

473
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:39,400
router again I'm going back and harping

474
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:43,240
on that slash 64 because that's your

475
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:46,530
basic building block of v6 if you're

476
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,370
giving somebody a slash 127 points point

477
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,110
it'll know the fact that it's

478
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:52,600
point-to-point

479
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:54,129
by the fact that it's 127 if you've

480
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,959
given somebody 126

481
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,190
yeah it'll also know it's a

482
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,470
point-to-point for the fact that it's a

483
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:01,960
126 because you've just got your

484
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:04,929
broadcasts on the other side same as the

485
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,610
slash 30 except for the fact that

486
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:08,740
there's actually a denial service attack

487
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:10,229
you can do against those to broadcast in

488
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:16,740
v6

489
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:19,690
that's why 127 is a better choice so

490
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:23,049
once you've received an RA you can

491
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:24,429
magically let o configure yourself some

492
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:28,360
danger works we'll touch on that in a

493
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:32,130
bit and router solicitations of

494
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:35,799
multicast so as I said

495
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:38,140
uuuuu are all the multicast domain so

496
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:40,389
I'm going to send my router solicitation

497
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,710
that will hit everybody and hopefully

498
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:46,080
one of you is going to come back and

499
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:49,990
send me a router advertisement off-cycle

500
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,429
and you can redirect to a better router

501
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:54,309
because

502
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:57,220
being a very simple advertising protocol

503
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:58,899
I can then say I'm your router and then

504
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:05,880
somebody come come along later and say

505
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:05,880
I'm a better router okay

506
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:16,720
so addressing one statics everybody's

507
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:19,889
happy with statics right great you can

508
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:24,910
let the client take its router

509
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:26,620
advertisement take its eui-64 put the

510
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:29,790
two of them together and you'll get

511
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:33,330
what's called slack a stateless address

512
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:35,830
automatically generated is that nifty I

513
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:38,260
mean really is that nifty how much

514
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:41,678
configurations is it take to do v6 on a

515
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:43,120
machine you plug it in you turn it on as

516
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,190
long as three sixes in your kernel

517
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,449
you're good to go

518
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:53,890
IT guys are paranoid and hate this this

519
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:56,679
is why IT guys or girls or small for

520
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:59,050
recruits from El Baron seven will turn

521
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,250
off ipv6 every chance they get because

522
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:08,220
they're scared and they don't know how

523
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:10,840
to deal with it and third way v6 DHCP

524
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,809
which is what lets your IT guys who are

525
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:18,250
scared of stateless quato configuration

526
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:23,740
be less scared okay

527
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:29,650
cool thing that dhcpv6 does is you can

528
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:32,620
say with dhcpv6 hey I'm a subnet tell me

529
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:38,320
what my subnet range is and it'll give

530
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:42,159
you a prefix nifty even better you can

531
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:45,280
ask it for bigger than a 64 using

532
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:49,330
something called a PD hint so you can go

533
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:53,020
back and say can I have a slash 60 can I

534
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:55,570
have a slash 56 and if the DHCP server

535
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:57,879
is configured to do it it'll give you

536
00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:01,990
that block which you can then slice and

537
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:06,350
dice locally my personal provider if I

538
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:09,330
ask her slash 60 will hand me a slash 60

539
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:10,230
yeah break it up in your house firewall

540
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,809
it however you want

541
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:14,880
put your media streamer's on one subnet

542
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:17,639
put your I owe two light bulbs on

543
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,470
another subnet okay you may have to run

544
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,730
an ipv4 gateway at the end but then

545
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:22,730
you've got security at least a

546
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:31,440
combination of using dhcpv6 PD and slack

547
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,899
is probably the most common home

548
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,000
configuration and in fact that's the

549
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:39,360
default for every consumer Soho gateway

550
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:45,630
I've looked at that supports v6 it will

551
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:48,149
do up DHCP PD for its subnet and then

552
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:54,990
it'll slack locally and it will usually

553
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:58,040
slack for insert from address so slack

554
00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:03,090
is really simple you determine your Mac

555
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:06,178
get your UI 64 get the covering Ethernet

556
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:08,389
segment slam them together and you're

557
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:08,390
done

558
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:15,300
are you a vegetarian are you having

559
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:20,000
trouble with this address because dead

560
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:20,000
beef is indeed illegitimate ipv6 address

561
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:27,090
because their hex which means you can

562
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,740
actually have some fun embeddings if you

563
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:34,980
want to you can actually embed codes and

564
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:36,480
cheer to route subnet addresses and this

565
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:43,559
also gives us our link local address

566
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:47,790
it's the same thing okay I'm glad you're

567
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:48,750
laughing you're meant to okay potential

568
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:51,928
dangers are slack

569
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:54,210
what are they oh I went back about IT

570
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:55,590
guys in their paranoia and before I

571
00:32:54,210 --> 00:33:03,410
insult anybody is anybody here a

572
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:03,409
paranoid IT person who turns off v6 what

573
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:18,529
instead I get can you go up to

574
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:21,169
microphone and say that yeah so Viktor

575
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:23,120
worthy yeah pretty much any big

576
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:25,279
enterprise you go there you check your

577
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,529
middle boxes security guys will tell you

578
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,169
I p6 non-existent

579
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:33,740
really simple story is just like that

580
00:33:30,169 --> 00:33:38,090
easy the support of that protocol works

581
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:41,140
is like IDP all of your premier support

582
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:44,658
ipv6 is really really like shallow their

583
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:48,049
software support ipv6 Hadoop open source

584
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:51,860
IPSec it's not supported 2028 yeah

585
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:56,899
that's the problem because people are

586
00:33:51,860 --> 00:34:04,370
scared of ipv6 and actually I would say

587
00:33:56,899 --> 00:34:07,489
most of the major sniffers and a lot of

588
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:10,339
your SEM boxes now actually crop v6

589
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:12,530
properly and I know at least Apple and

590
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:15,080
Microsoft are very piece eccentric at

591
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,520
this point if you're going to develop it

592
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:20,089
for either of them it's going to speak

593
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:23,570
v6 but you can speak these six without

594
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:27,409
knowing it and that's for some people

595
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:29,599
problem well you can either turn it off

596
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:32,349
in the kernel or you can get with it and

597
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,349
go forward

598
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:47,589
real problem in some parts of the world

599
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:51,969
a v6 lack a v6 address done by slack is

600
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:55,369
attached to the device it's burned in

601
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:58,189
there are some regimes that if they want

602
00:34:55,369 --> 00:35:00,950
to track you will track your v6

603
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:02,390
addresses so if you take your laptop and

604
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,259
you go to Pete's coffee and then you go

605
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:07,400
to Tim Hortons

606
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:12,589
and you run your v6 there well I'll sure

607
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:15,980
I brought speed eats vas big brother's

608
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:18,970
watching you and you can track

609
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:23,650
somebody's movements by their v6 address

610
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:23,649
this is very real concern in some places

611
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:32,269
there are privacy addressing which do

612
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:36,019
rotations the original ones you could

613
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:40,098
actually walk backwards on 80 84 is the

614
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:41,990
most recent RFC covering this truth is

615
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:46,279
though unless you're developer don't

616
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:47,839
worry about it because unless you're

617
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:49,430
developer putting in the kernel you

618
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:53,450
can't do anything anyway

619
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:58,549
I believe Windows 10 does support it in

620
00:35:53,450 --> 00:36:00,970
the most recent OSX I've been told

621
00:35:58,549 --> 00:36:04,038
supports it since one release back

622
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:05,750
although I've not actually done a sniff

623
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:17,660
to prove that so don't take me at my

624
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:24,829
word and there is a gorilla that how

625
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:28,250
many people here love that one you're

626
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:31,519
having a true thing with it you're so so

627
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:37,309
on that okay personally I don't like

628
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:41,450
that so but there are places where you

629
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:45,890
actually want to do NAT in v6 land you

630
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:47,868
want to do NAT on the prefix this is a

631
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:50,690
really handy thing to do if you have two

632
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:51,810
providers so you can easily switch out

633
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:54,730
which week your

634
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:58,690
you keep your host address the same and

635
00:36:54,730 --> 00:37:01,270
you change your prefix the concept of

636
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:05,470
actually adding an ipv6 host address is

637
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:07,240
anathema to anybody in the v6 world so

638
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,770
it's not the same as local net and IPP

639
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,859
Portland where you're just taking one

640
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:15,070
and you know oh I've got 416 machines

641
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:17,050
here I will take 1416 machines and map

642
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:18,490
them out of one port and hope that your

643
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:23,980
port mapping doesn't break on the way

644
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:26,290
back use a good stateful firewall you're

645
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:31,930
providing inbound services and a simple

646
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:35,100
block if you don't but ICMP is a

647
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:39,609
requirement for it to work properly now

648
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:42,640
you see a three letter word which I call

649
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:49,030
a four letter word to be quite honest in

650
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:53,529
their peripheral interconnect it's not

651
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:56,560
so bad is it you plug the card in and it

652
00:37:53,530 --> 00:38:04,119
works talks to the CPU the way to

653
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:06,700
speculative bandwidth wrong PCI okay if

654
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:09,280
anybody here can tell me we're in one

655
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:12,939
point three point seven of the PCI spec

656
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:16,240
it says thou shalt NAT and thou shalt

657
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:18,640
not use ipv6 I will buy you a beer I

658
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:23,740
will buy you any sixteen dollar beer at

659
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:27,810
that bar and I'll use two dollar bills

660
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:30,490
to do it with that's how obscure I'll be

661
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:33,040
but the truth of the matter is all it

662
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:36,069
says is that you have to obscure your

663
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,930
internal network and don't show your out

664
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:40,210
don't show your inside addresses the

665
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:43,299
outside will have balancing proper

666
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:46,119
stateful firewalls this is PCI

667
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:50,859
consultants who don't understand

668
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:54,460
networking yes that was the soapbox I'm

669
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:57,900
standing on it and fame buddy wants to

670
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,900
discuss that afterwards I'll be happy to

671
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:04,020
now I've been harping on the fact that

672
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:08,010
slash 64 is the basic building block

673
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:12,390
well a long time ago people would assign

674
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:14,310
a 124 or 122 or some smaller block well

675
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:18,150
sometimes they do this simply out of the

676
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:20,730
misguidance that hey 124 is 255 host

677
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:24,150
addresses that's the slash 24s worth

678
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:25,890
that's all you need sometimes they would

679
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:29,190
do it out of fear of a denial service

680
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:31,049
attack with network discovery where you

681
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:34,770
could simply keep poking MAC addresses

682
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:39,000
and fill the table sauce which that was

683
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:41,060
true maybe 10 years ago now it's been

684
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,690
fixed in hardware on all modern

685
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:48,299
top-of-rack switches all of the later

686
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:51,540
versions iOS XR has fixed it

687
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:56,010
Juno's fixed it in 13 there is no issue

688
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:58,860
with the slash 64 at the edge and I have

689
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:00,420
taken onyxia and tried to break various

690
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:05,730
bits of hardware and haven't been able

691
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:10,500
to so don't do it because your switch

692
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:16,970
will switch faster with 64 so this is my

693
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,970
breather have a chart sorry

694
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:24,590
so differences 32 bits 128 bits you can

695
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,380
take all of your v4 address space and

696
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:31,380
just map your physical address

697
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:33,660
representation into a v6 address address

698
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,640
types unicast multicast broadcast

699
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:37,799
unicast multicast anycast

700
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:43,200
your packet header sizes are different

701
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:44,760
these six is bigger get over it it'll

702
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,618
get even bigger if you're using segment

703
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:52,800
routing and if you embed segment routing

704
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:56,190
and say you're doing VX LAN and then you

705
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:58,859
want to stack that into a so you've got

706
00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:02,820
your UDP header your segment routing

707
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:07,380
headers your VX LAN header and then your

708
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:09,869
payload jumbo frames of your friend but

709
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:14,550
this is also why the 1280 by minimum m2

710
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:18,740
you IPSec is baked into ipv6 even if you

711
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:18,740
don't use it it's net on it before

712
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:30,670
so time for a quick mindset change who

713
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:35,560
here is a router jockey one two three

714
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:41,170
four five six seven good eight nine ten

715
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:43,230
how many of you use AI GRP dodged that

716
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:54,850
bullet

717
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:57,790
okay some realities what yeah this is

718
00:41:54,850 --> 00:42:01,060
why there are standards okay

719
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:03,700
realities the RIR have functionally out

720
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:06,549
of v6 space yeah there's the second

721
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,509
during market I would really like to put

722
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:11,140
those guys out of business

723
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:13,480
with v6 it's functionally in women do

724
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,430
you can get it use a proper hierarchy

725
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:20,640
there's no reason to conserve v6 space

726
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:23,589
if you run out of your / 30 to get more

727
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,430
if you run out of more and by the way I

728
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:28,900
know Aaron actually pads their

729
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:30,669
allocations so that if you ask for more

730
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,560
than you say okay here's your here's

731
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:39,070
your next block and it's just a

732
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:40,870
contiguous space the other are our

733
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:42,510
guards do similar things but we're in

734
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:47,529
North America so I'll reference our word

735
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:50,170
up use a proper hierarchy you have a

736
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:52,870
slash 30 to give each of your pops of

737
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:56,200
slash 36 and then give your super

738
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:58,690
regions bigger blocks so if you have a

739
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:02,649
slash 32 you can comfortably have about

740
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:04,540
48 pops with enough space to populate

741
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:07,110
the world a couple of times over and

742
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:13,630
that's before you get down to your end

743
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:17,500
addressing you may need to pass before

744
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:18,970
over an IP six link at some point how

745
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,480
many people in here using v6 without

746
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:25,839
realizing it how many people here have a

747
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,170
modern cell phone the speaks LTE you got

748
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,960
it

749
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:32,190
that's all v6

750
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:37,200
which broke skype which is why you now

751
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:39,030
had to mat from v4 to b6 inside your

752
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,299
phone so you could present a v4 address

753
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:45,030
to Skype which is why Apple got really

754
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,830
hard-nosed about all of your apps have

755
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:51,770
to speak v6 natively so they didn't have

756
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:51,770
to do that translation cool isn't it

757
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:56,669
so that's tunneling and it's beyond the

758
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:59,520
scope of this presentation Geoff Huston

759
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:01,350
of ap Nick has done some really awesome

760
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:06,600
research on tunneling and the effects of

761
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:14,520
tunneling did I leave out huge amounts

762
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:17,400
yeah you bet v6 just like before but you

763
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,700
know it's just bigger right well not

764
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,700
exactly

765
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:33,150
static sir statics 30 31 127 easy peasy

766
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:43,860
it's still using rip anyone good

767
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:47,460
next OSB - doesn't speak v6 OSPF v3 does

768
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:51,270
speak v6 many people will actually run

769
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:55,350
parallel stacks with OS VfB - and OSPF

770
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:59,400
v3 as opposed to running OSPF v3 with

771
00:44:55,350 --> 00:45:01,680
realms there are some neat tricks you

772
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,000
can play with that you can have slightly

773
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,310
different allocations you can do

774
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,660
different quality of service whatever I

775
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:12,450
have found a few places that are doing

776
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:18,200
p3 realms and production mostly in

777
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:20,250
Africa I don't know point is though

778
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:23,009
depending upon what routing protocols

779
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:24,690
you're running in order to run v6

780
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:28,110
effectively you may have to throw out

781
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:29,880
your current routing or you may have to

782
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:36,750
run a parallel routing protocol to get

783
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:40,650
v6 personally my choice is is is because

784
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:45,600
it doesn't care v6 before

785
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:47,460
v8 whatever it'll run it because it's

786
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:52,670
actually running it away or blow layer

787
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:57,350
three they're equal through transparent

788
00:45:52,670 --> 00:46:02,160
BGP well BGP will do anything to anybody

789
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:03,360
I swear was invented by Victorinox it's

790
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,080
the Swiss Army knife of routing

791
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:08,580
protocols you can do anything with it of

792
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:12,650
course you can also cut your toes off

793
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:12,650
like humans Swiss Army knife be careful

794
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:20,670
it looks just like before v6 it's all

795
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:23,549
new filters cisco will let you pass

796
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:24,270
before over v6 could be six over v4

797
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:27,570
connection

798
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:30,140
juniper will let you pass the for

799
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:32,370
routing information over a v6 connection

800
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:35,759
which is kind of cool that they started

801
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:39,270
doing that sixteen point two I don't

802
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,950
know anybody does that by the way you

803
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:44,280
can get into religious arguments over

804
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:47,250
whether you want to have multiple NL RI

805
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:51,690
in one like I'm not getting to that

806
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:52,760
religious argument just you can do it

807
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:56,430
you can do it either way

808
00:46:52,760 --> 00:47:03,380
best common practice for providers is to

809
00:46:56,430 --> 00:47:05,970
give you two separate bgp sessions now

810
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:09,930
evil pure and simple from the eighth

811
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:15,750
dimension anybody who gets that get

812
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:19,319
surprised like I said Jeff Houston did a

813
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:23,630
presentation sometimes you need to pass

814
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:26,960
stuff over the wrong protocol in tunnels

815
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:30,570
maybe it's not so bad it's close though

816
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:34,440
for six Forex lat and that's 64 work

817
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:37,950
really well because in that case you're

818
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,690
actually taking your v6 whacking your

819
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:47,490
header running it down and pushing it

820
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:48,680
back on in that 64 you're well it's more

821
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:50,779
complex

822
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,890
and there's a presentation lost not next

823
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,839
week if you want to go see that

824
00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:57,440
everybody go buy your tickets to do what

825
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:58,819
Melbourne I've seen Andrews Andrew

826
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,260
Cruise doing presentation on it I've

827
00:47:58,819 --> 00:48:06,470
seen its documentation in script brought

828
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:09,410
talk ipv4 and ipv6 have the same failure

829
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:15,379
rate in native mode and it's down around

830
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:18,470
0.2 percent ipv6 tunneled over ipv4 in a

831
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:20,930
64 tunnel gives you about a two percent

832
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:23,270
connection failure rate with happy

833
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:27,980
eyeballs this can make a difference and

834
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:31,069
can give you unhappy customers so if

835
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:32,440
your DNS is set up properly to return an

836
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:36,680
a record it will do the right thing

837
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:39,579
somebody coming in from a tunnel gets

838
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:43,368
the quad a record coming back at them

839
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:46,520
tries to do an ipv6 fails happy eyeballs

840
00:48:43,369 --> 00:48:51,680
will save it anybody here know what

841
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:53,720
happy eyeballs is okay it's a means of

842
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,149
saying quickly timing out your v6

843
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:58,578
connection falling back to before if if

844
00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:00,079
you you get both a right you get the

845
00:48:58,579 --> 00:49:02,180
quad a in the a record back you try the

846
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,410
quad a record first you can't make your

847
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:09,348
connection you giving them a time to

848
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:13,879
fall back and that's about it I'm on

849
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:17,589
time if you're embedding a v6 address

850
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:20,059
into a URL embedded in square brackets

851
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:21,589
that's gonna throw a lot of people the

852
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:23,450
first time they see v6 did you just try

853
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:26,109
to put it in there that will be

854
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:28,069
interpreted as a logical address

855
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:30,078
embedded in square brackets does the

856
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:36,829
right thing square bracket call and port

857
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:40,670
number pinging traceroute and a lot of

858
00:49:36,829 --> 00:49:44,030
other utilities will default it before

859
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:46,670
if they get a quad a in single a record

860
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:51,140
back bill default to v4 so you have to

861
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:53,359
tell it or give it a literal address and

862
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:57,430
it's ping six or ping - six or some

863
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:57,430
variant based on your operating system

864
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:06,319
ah QA footnotes space it's really big

865
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:08,089
you got that one Aston Martin never

866
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:14,090
released the db8 it would have come out

867
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:16,430
2001 but the db9 the successors gb7 was

868
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:18,830
the db9 because Aston Martin didn't want

869
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:23,470
to be known for putting a v8 into a car

870
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:26,509
that came out with a v12 okay

871
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:28,009
the evil obviously buckaroo banzai was

872
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:31,700
reputed to have said that at a press

873
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:33,800
conference as far as you know he's still

874
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:37,850
practicing medicine and doing particle

875
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:41,150
physics in new jersey the rest of the

876
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:43,790
links and there is an appendix with a

877
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:45,830
bunch of router configurations which I'm

878
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:48,680
just going to page through they're all

879
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:51,799
in the slides you can download thank you

880
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,810
questions we're on time please go to a

881
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,000
microphone tell us who you are and who

882
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:58,370
you're talking for if you're talking to

883
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,860
yourself and before you do that I'll say

884
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:04,069
that's a coup and he's the one giving

885
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:08,930
the presentation on tunneling and v4 v6

886
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:13,160
at a spa snob your timing is perfect

887
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:16,100
Andrew your question please sir Nate

888
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:18,649
Todd with ViaSat Communications a quick

889
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:21,020
question in regards to fold you'd

890
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:22,880
mentioned four-point point and then just

891
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:25,040
straight loop back address suggestions

892
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,660
what would you do to handle like a point

893
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,220
to multi-point where I've got a maybe

894
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:30,710
three or four routers in the same domain

895
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:33,169
that just automatically be as 64

896
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:35,680
automatic would be the slip 64 okay

897
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:38,750
second question in regards to the

898
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:41,810
smallest prefix publicly acceptable on

899
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:43,550
the internet for peering is a 48

900
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:45,230
globally adopted or is that something

901
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:50,780
just air and that's probably adopted

902
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:52,940
okay well the reason I ask is because

903
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:55,700
we're getting slash we're getting slash

904
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:58,940
64 is from our blackman peering down in

905
00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:01,419
Brazil so I just I didn't know if it was

906
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:01,420
something that's

907
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:19,790
and okay everybody I know cultures on 48

908
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:22,940
so and ripe yeah anyway next please

909
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:26,840
Dave Krause Sienna I have a question

910
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:30,230
more from a personal point that is um is

911
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:35,120
it possible to just get an allocation of

912
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:37,310
IP six addresses for myself like like a

913
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:40,400
phone number sure

914
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:45,490
good your IR and say I want to slash 48

915
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:49,310
and they'll say give me 500 bucks okay

916
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:52,609
there there is a small small movement of

917
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:57,230
foot to start to start the mechanism in

918
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:59,900
ppm l to basically tell the our IRS to

919
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:03,820
basically generate PEZ dispenser for

920
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:05,840
slash 48 swipe your credit card get a 48

921
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:08,210
that's a couple years off at the

922
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:18,470
earliest as people were just starting to

923
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:21,850
think about it in the bar comes with a

924
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:27,230
free EAS number all right yeah

925
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:30,230
next please sure hey Jason bode Moody's

926
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:33,580
great talk thank you yeah well then I

927
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:36,140
wanted to get your opinion intake on

928
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:37,549
helping folks accelerate this wonderful

929
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:41,810
protocol on getting it implemented what

930
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:46,010
are your thoughts around using 60 PE

931
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:48,500
like gar 6rc 46:59 and for those that

932
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:49,820
aren't running is a yes that always PF

933
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:53,360
out there but they want to get there and

934
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:58,640
they're running MPLS Network for OSPF

935
00:53:53,360 --> 00:54:07,430
OSPF v3 no SPF e2 and and and mus you

936
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:11,170
can run OSPF v3 you you can force at

937
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:17,000
least on juniper into

938
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:20,900
RSVP'd three table but yeah I'm checking

939
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,970
on 60s six vpe right and in general so I

940
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:26,420
don't know if you you know familiar with

941
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:32,089
it or I am from the with it in general I

942
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:36,530
don't like tunneling and Nina yeah but

943
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:38,780
if you have to six Rd or rum just pop

944
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:41,720
pop it into an MPLS tunnel okay

945
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:47,260
very good thanks thank you next please

946
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:52,129
Chris sorry Chris or would berkeley lab

947
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:58,450
how much you said ICMP is required yes

948
00:54:52,130 --> 00:55:02,990
all ICMP person taps i was hand waving

949
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:04,669
but there are about nine ICMP types that

950
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:09,890
you want to let through v6 to work

951
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:12,890
properly and i really was going into a

952
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:14,330
high level here I'll take it off wine

953
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:17,200
with you later and send you the list if

954
00:55:14,330 --> 00:55:21,710
you want if you give me your address

955
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:24,049
anybody else okay I'm feeling good I

956
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:24,650
