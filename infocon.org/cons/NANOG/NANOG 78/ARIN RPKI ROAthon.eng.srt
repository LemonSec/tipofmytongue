1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,770
but thank you so this is a first for me

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,410
so as many you can tell I'm height

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,389
challenged right and usually come these

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,840
things in one of the first things I ask

5
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:15,178
is can you see me I'm behind one these

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,660
translucent things right so I know you

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,279
can see me so we're all good that way so

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,220
what I'd like to talk to you today is

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,619
give you sort of an intro to rpki and

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,710
I'm not going to tell you about what bid

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,269
is at what packet and that sort of thing

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,009
I'm going to give you sort of intro and

13
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:36,540
give you sort of a stats where we stand

14
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:39,629
with rellis so so we have a bunch of

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,649
operational routing challenges right we

16
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:46,289
have things that hit the press about

17
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:49,620
sites not being seen going to other

18
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,270
places and so on and so forth and this

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,030
has been talked about for a long period

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,579
of time and we've had multiple solutions

21
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,730
on the table and we have one that seems

22
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,890
to be quite promising with RBI so we're

23
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,459
going to then talk about our parents

24
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,229
RPI components statistics I'm going

25
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,000
announcer both on that we're going to

26
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:11,880
have on Wednesday morning for you who

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,630
want to exercise this some and and with

28
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:20,729
IRR status because it's yet another way

29
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:23,908
of doing some security things with

30
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,100
routing so one of the things that we

31
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,920
have here is internet based on two

32
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,850
critical resources right dns and BGP and

33
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,360
one of the things that was interesting

34
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:39,360
is in the about the 2001-2002 time

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,189
period Richard Clark from the White

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,799
House actually convened a group of

37
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,449
experts to talk about these two

38
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,509
components and what could we do to

39
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,700
secure them and what was interesting is

40
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,009
that DNS SEC had been around for a while

41
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,409
and it needed a few tweaks yet but it's

42
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,850
getting close to real-time and so there

43
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,899
was a little bit of talk about that and

44
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,030
it's mainly from a deployment

45
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,490
perspective and at that point I worked

46
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,829
for Verisign and we were well on her way

47
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,439
of experimenting with it and putting it

48
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,619
into production everyone has an

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,329
opportunity to use DNS SEC today the

50
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,690
second part of the conversation was

51
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,760
dealing with secure rotting

52
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,910
and what is interesting about this is

53
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,310
that there was two competing camps in

54
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:24,430
the that were on that phone call when

55
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:27,040
was secure BGP s BGP and the other one

56
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,990
is secure origin BGP and both of them

57
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,959
had times that the table talked about

58
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:34,810
what they thought was best and and you

59
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,150
can see that it just there was nothing

60
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,760
really there yet on the secure routing

61
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:45,150
side where there was sort of a sort of

62
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:48,040
advance Ford action by the DNS side so

63
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,260
you can tell today that you know SEC is

64
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,380
what widely deployed and we're working

65
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,329
on security and routing to this day so

66
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,299
in both of these things of course are

67
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:01,450
very secure required for critical

68
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:04,390
internet resources so let's talk about

69
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,670
some operational challenges we have so

70
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,410
before a long time ago the internet was

71
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:12,670
built in a day where everybody knew

72
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:14,980
everybody I remember back in 1991 being

73
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:18,220
able to just see who was on which system

74
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,109
and they be able to talk to them I think

75
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,989
a few of you in the room probably had

76
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:26,290
that same sort of experience that's no

77
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:29,020
longer the case then it moved on from

78
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,470
sort of reach ability on ISPs that you

79
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,630
trust

80
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,400
hey I'll connect you you connect to me

81
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,970
I've route to share that sort of thing

82
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,520
and that it moved into contracts and now

83
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,230
it moved from a sort of a small set of

84
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,780
trust belies piece into a worldwide

85
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:48,790
group so which have more nefarious

86
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:50,650
intentions than others so to go along

87
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,870
with it technology has been incomplete

88
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,700
at best right we don't have a lot of

89
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,370
automation to filter I've been in

90
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,500
multiple meetings with large scale lies

91
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,560
peace trying to solve this problem and

92
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,890
this is something that's been frankly

93
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,110
hard to deal with while this is going on

94
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:10,359
we've had misconfigurations nefarious

95
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,180
attempts and that's where it thinks that

96
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,160
have made the press have certainly made

97
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,660
nanog and

98
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,810
one of the things that came out of this

99
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,539
which I thought was very telling is IB

100
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:25,900
statement of routing and that is our

101
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:27,820
routing is based on rumors think about

102
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,950
this the world's

103
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,920
nificant poor portion of the world's GDP

104
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:36,670
is now based on the Internet and it's

105
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,740
based on rumors that's kind of scary in

106
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,850
some ways but it gives you a sort of a

107
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,110
challenge to what we have to look

108
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,860
forward to to actually solve in the

109
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:47,890
future so we have a couple case studies

110
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:52,810
about this hey once familiar who's not

111
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:54,969
familiar about the Pakistan case ok I

112
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,640
think most of the people here actually

113
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,010
realized that we have another one in

114
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,760
Turkey where we had the same sort of

115
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:06,849
censorship going on there where türk

116
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,760
Telekom dns wanted to order censorship

117
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:12,550
for Twitter whereas Pakistan Telecom it

118
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,010
was based on YouTube and they'd out

119
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,950
instead of using router impact Pakistan

120
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:21,219
telecoms example you use DNS tor

121
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,620
telecoms example and a people router run

122
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,680
using Google's DNS service as a result

123
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,980
and so they hijacked Google's IP

124
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,480
addresses as a result so this could both

125
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,090
these events could have been prevented

126
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:37,260
with RPI both these cases are well-known

127
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:40,630
sort of cases within those countries

128
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,700
what's interesting is that the world is

129
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,700
sort of pivoted and now we're starting

130
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:48,820
to see more cases of things going after

131
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:51,159
money so you have Cedella secure

132
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,590
networks having a slash 24 that was

133
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,870
hijacked and was to intercepting

134
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,359
communications between Bitcoin miners

135
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:04,780
and data poles and then we have another

136
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:06,880
one be PJSC Foss telecom did the same

137
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,090
things but with financial IP addresses

138
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,130
of financial institutions so you can see

139
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,520
that it they're going after targeting

140
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:17,950
after fairly significant spaces of

141
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,219
address space including perhaps your

142
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:24,789
credit card information so we also have

143
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:27,520
other cases amazon's route route 53 din

144
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:31,030
yes DNS infrastructure service that

145
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,250
dealt with my ether wallet comm and

146
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,690
frankly the only way it was caught and

147
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,570
he caught this early is that they got

148
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,770
their DNS SEC wrong otherwise they would

149
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,650
have been gone on for a little bit

150
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:45,370
longer and then of course last year

151
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:48,340
we're in a case where a lot of traffic

152
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:53,440
was sent to a steel plant in Pittsburgh

153
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:55,030
and that course made a knock so you can

154
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,110
see here that we've had multiple cases

155
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,750
many of these do you have heard about

156
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:02,169
and yeah okay so what are we gonna do

157
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:04,570
solve it so it's 16 technologies that we

158
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:07,180
have today with routes of ISP of origin

159
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:10,180
are learning you looked at IRR registry

160
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:14,229
ok I can do that or you can do letters

161
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:16,539
of authorization Loa S or you just maybe

162
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:18,669
it just looks legit hey I did a who is

163
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:21,909
an entry on this particular on a slash

164
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:25,090
24 and Aaron or ripe or AP Nick or lack

165
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:28,270
nick etc and it just it seemed right so

166
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:31,710
I'll go ahead and announce that slash 24

167
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:35,948
or larger through my through my ISP or

168
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:37,448
in the case of if your enterprise does

169
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:39,310
something else maybe you're monitoring

170
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:42,610
your your announcements through some

171
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:45,669
third party like eg P Mon thousand eyes

172
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,349
etc so do we have alternative because

173
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:49,479
all these things are somewhat reactive

174
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:50,560
as either in the early stage is

175
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:52,479
something that's kind of error-prone

176
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,280
because they're involves humans or in

177
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,719
the latter stages is all sort of

178
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:01,859
reactive after that case so enter RPI

179
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,000
resource public key infrastructure a

180
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,400
cryptographically certifies network

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,389
resources your autonomous system numbers

182
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,400
and IP addresses both v4 and v6 and one

183
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:15,990
of the byproducts of this is that we

184
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,560
have a way of actually certifying route

185
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,530
announcements through ROS

186
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,050
route origin authorizations and so that

187
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:27,179
allows you to actually say this set of

188
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:30,970
IP addresses comes from this or geneious

189
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,979
so how some of the basics and I've just

190
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,409
given this to you so you can sit say ok

191
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,909
I heard this and now when I look at it I

192
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:39,458
understand the words are being used

193
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:41,830
sound can go into this further so the

194
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:44,469
RPI is actually involved of multiple

195
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:48,670
components one is the repository and

196
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:52,030
within the repository is RFC 3779

197
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,890
certificates which actually lists out

198
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,529
all your internet resources for that

199
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,079
particular

200
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:59,360
organization associated with that or

201
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:01,370
Brewis you will have these rules there

202
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,310
are associated with all your networks

203
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,620
that you provision within the system and

204
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,930
then you have CRLs in the case if

205
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,610
something went wrong or you want to end

206
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,309
you want to stop that row and

207
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:16,459
prematurely before it's expiration date

208
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:18,290
it is the CRL in that case and the last

209
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:20,268
part of its is a manifest and the

210
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,860
manifest is put in there so that you

211
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:24,110
know that if you pull this information

212
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,059
down from one of the repositories that

213
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:30,079
you're getting the entire contents

214
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:33,170
nothing more and nothing less this is

215
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:34,758
how it kind of works so everybody has

216
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,620
all these trust anchors on their

217
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:37,819
browsers right everybody goes to

218
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,519
websites and you have all these

219
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:42,199
certificates on it and so on and so

220
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:44,120
forth and one of the things that people

221
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:46,370
try to do in their very early stages is

222
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,170
say instead of the thousand trust

223
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,779
anchors like you have in your browser we

224
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,550
want to have one or just a handful and

225
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:54,529
you can see here that we have a

226
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,709
hierarchy of resource certificates here

227
00:09:54,529 --> 00:10:00,110
that goes from I Anna down to regional

228
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:03,559
registries and being one to regionalize

229
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:06,379
P to another regional ISP to some i

230
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:09,949
entice someplace you can see that's how

231
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:12,079
it was originally intended to work and

232
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:14,870
basically what you can do there is you

233
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,809
can follow a path through validation on

234
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:20,029
these particular route authorizations

235
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:22,430
going from the trust actor going down

236
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:25,309
you can actually validate that that row

237
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:28,579
is in fact correct and being signed over

238
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:33,079
by the ISP who got that certificate that

239
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:34,819
list is that resource so one of the

240
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:37,878
things that happened to is is that

241
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:39,469
politics could kind of gotten away and

242
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:41,929
there were some other operational

243
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,910
concerns as well and so we ended up

244
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:45,290
having five trust anchors one for each

245
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,870
of the regional registries and

246
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,969
underneath the regional registry again

247
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:54,490
you can issue row us and so and so forth

248
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:56,720
so and that's been working very well so

249
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,699
basically in theory what you do is you

250
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,339
pull down these plot files through a

251
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:03,500
repository and you say a validating

252
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:05,929
mechanism to make sure that you got the

253
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,640
entire contents of all the rows across

254
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:09,769
the internet and

255
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:12,279
you can then communicate with your

256
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:13,430
router whether or not these routes are

257
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,459
valid

258
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:19,219
hey the road matches the route I

259
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:21,229
received and everything's cool invalid

260
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,480
the road doesn't match the route I

261
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,700
received or unknown

262
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,000
basically it's insecure at that point

263
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,290
and then it's up to you at each ISP did

264
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,240
figure out what they want to do and what

265
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:35,140
local policy what they want to do with

266
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,779
this information so it's fairly simple

267
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:42,230
so what it does it protect it protects

268
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:45,680
unauthorized origin attacks but it does

269
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:48,620
not stop as a s padding or

270
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,529
man-in-the-middle router tax both of

271
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,329
which occurred but it's envisioned to be

272
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:56,510
a bootstrap into a stronger sort of

273
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:58,310
mechanism the first attempt on this I

274
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:03,560
mentioned very early in the day was

275
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:05,268
secure BGP it failed and the reason why

276
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,189
I failed it was kind of it was too

277
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:08,570
complex is peace didn't like it they

278
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,800
didn't like that idea that they would

279
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,660
have to sign hop-by-hop

280
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,140
they didn't like to have the idea that

281
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:17,240
they would have to have private keys on

282
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:20,120
routers and places that they may not

283
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,180
have physical complete physical access

284
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,730
to the routers etc the second attempt is

285
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,859
under way and it's a variant of secure

286
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,970
origin BGP which I find fairly ironic

287
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,130
because this is something that was

288
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:34,070
talked about twenty years ago and it's

289
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:36,079
called ASPA today so something for you

290
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:40,010
to look at if you want to follow the ITF

291
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:42,439
ASPA looks like it may be a way for it

292
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,329
to actually deal with path validation so

293
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,170
we have origin validation and we're

294
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:50,839
working on path validation so steps are

295
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:53,079
using our PK so provision your networks

296
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,820
tied to your networks to your origin AS

297
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:57,260
second step is this is fetch and

298
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,699
configure a validator and there's plenty

299
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,980
of them I'll get into that a little bit

300
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:02,990
look at the results and you can

301
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,269
configure these your validator to feed

302
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,880
the results to the edge routers and then

303
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:10,130
filter them as you wish so a fairly

304
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:14,600
simple set of tests actually under what

305
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:16,540
not o put into place so let's go ahead

306
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,220
and look at Aaron's repository

307
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:22,170
provisioning and then using

308
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,600
so one of the first things you need to

309
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:27,060
do is well that you want Aaron to host

310
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,800
your certificate authority or you want

311
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,719
Aaron to delegate it and we'll go into

312
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,670
the pros and cons on that in a minute

313
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,860
so the first thing you have to do in

314
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,740
either case is sign in to Aaron online

315
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:41,850
who here has internet resources that

316
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:48,000
does not have an Aaron account writ

317
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:50,940
occur you have Aaron resources I thought

318
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,570
you're in the right region okay okay all

319
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:58,080
right so so anyways oh I should probably

320
00:13:54,570 --> 00:14:00,570
say have resources with it within the

321
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,940
Aaron region that do not have a Aaron

322
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:05,010
account if not time to go ahead and get

323
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,140
your account today and once you've done

324
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,569
so you can actually start the process of

325
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,930
creating your resource certificates in

326
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:15,240
your most so we have two ways of doing

327
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:17,160
it one is hosted where we actually do

328
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,010
all the heavy lifting for you and it's

329
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,860
available via the web fit interface or a

330
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,480
restful interface or you can use

331
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,820
delegate using the up/down protocol

332
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,040
which is ITF standard it's a whole lot

333
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,530
more work although it's starting to get

334
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,060
easier and this may make sense for the

335
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:36,860
very large networks and I know a couple

336
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:39,959
are debating the use of this today so

337
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:42,030
the pros are using hosted is easier to

338
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,310
use web interface so if you want to

339
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:46,170
start just dang playing with this you

340
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,369
can go ahead and do so is there and

341
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,680
manage so you don't have to worry about

342
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,270
buying ATMs you don't have to worry

343
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,890
about signing these things over on a

344
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:58,020
daily basis etc pecans is right now you

345
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:00,240
can't have downstream customers use our

346
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,970
pokai we could set it in place we just

347
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,640
haven't had any requests to make that

348
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,200
happen yet large networks probably want

349
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,480
to use the restful interface because

350
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,970
sort of tedius putting in routes for

351
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,760
each year and that works in there as

352
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,350
well and the other con for security

353
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,720
people is that we hold your private key

354
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,980
because we do these daily signings of

355
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,540
the things that go into the repository

356
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:27,660
delegated allows you to keep your own

357
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:31,370
private key for your certificate I have

358
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,160
fallen if' down protocol and allows

359
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,740
downstream

360
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,920
murrs of yours actually is rpk the

361
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,050
contest is today has been fairly hard to

362
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,860
set up there's new software on horizon

363
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:46,329
that's making this less daunting

364
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,430
although we're to this day we're having

365
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:51,128
customers there talking to us and we're

366
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:53,229
actually sending snippets of asn.1 back

367
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:56,439
and forth to show how things can

368
00:15:53,230 --> 00:16:01,029
actually work and actually asn.1 it's

369
00:15:56,439 --> 00:16:03,069
very complex it's a pain so that it's

370
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:05,500
it's a very sort of tedious process to

371
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:07,479
get it going but their software coming

372
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,720
along that's actually going to make it

373
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,089
easier that's available on the net that

374
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,980
people can use

375
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:17,769
you have to require your you have to run

376
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,689
your own rpki environment and it

377
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:21,579
requires some time and effort to make it

378
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:24,459
happen and the big part of that is

379
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:25,810
running your repository so you have to

380
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:28,119
go ahead and when you sub these things

381
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:30,279
and say this is really cool but you have

382
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,019
to have a highly available repository so

383
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:34,540
if people can actually across the

384
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:36,550
internet can fetch your rellis that

385
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:39,279
you've created and they can actually put

386
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,779
it in they can actually concentrate all

387
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:45,040
these things together and actually how

388
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:46,779
to help validate them so you have to set

389
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,550
up all the road creation you need to set

390
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:50,230
up a certificate authority has to be

391
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,880
highly available repository as I

392
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:56,880
mentioned you need to create a

393
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:58,990
certificate practices statement CPS so

394
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,790
after you've gone ahead and you start

395
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:02,199
saying okay I figure out my provisioning

396
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,089
I'm gonna go with air and hosted or

397
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:05,589
whatever what I'm going to do then is

398
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:08,980
I'm going to start saying okay I want to

399
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:10,869
start playing that RPI ecosystem and see

400
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:13,059
what's going on there so the first thing

401
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:15,549
is and there's some multiple validator

402
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:17,649
so I'm using ripes as an example right

403
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:20,559
dependency has a nice validator that's

404
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:23,230
pretty intuitive that you can pull down

405
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,599
and you can actually start putting all

406
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,030
the repositories in there and you can

407
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:32,530
see what's valid and what's not valid on

408
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:35,020
the internet within errands reaching you

409
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:38,500
have to get the foul the towel excuse me

410
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:40,600
and put it into the validator right now

411
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,429
it's a very simple step and once you're

412
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,939
there you can visually validate all the

413
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:46,900
routes once you've done that once you've

414
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,790
got the validator

415
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,100
and you say hey this is really cool I

416
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:54,340
want to sort of plug this into my my

417
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:57,100
network you can actually use this

418
00:17:54,340 --> 00:18:00,310
validator to talk directly to various

419
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:04,719
routers using our TR protocol and there

420
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:08,700
are various vendors Juno's Cisco Nokia

421
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:12,280
etc they actually I actually have this

422
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:15,880
built into their software today their

423
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,639
software solutions bird open bgp d etc

424
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,820
they also have this built in to it today

425
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,040
so there's definitely a whole venue of

426
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,600
different solutions you can use here and

427
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:30,370
once you've set that up you're part of

428
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,649
the ecosystem so here's a bunch of other

429
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:35,080
validators rights not the only one

430
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:39,520
dragon research has one NL met labs

431
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:44,230
route Nader has one there's open BSD RPK

432
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:48,310
client and there's also go RTR there's

433
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:50,680
rip stir fort project and rpki validated

434
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:54,370
through CloudFlare so all these things

435
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:56,620
are available today for you to use so

436
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:59,919
let's go ahead and start looking at the

437
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:03,219
statistics so when it is interesting

438
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:06,280
seeing is here as you can see if we

439
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:08,170
started this back in 2012 and you can

440
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,050
see that there's just a few number of

441
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:13,630
participants and over the last couple

442
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:16,080
years is well over the last year year

443
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:19,300
and a half it's really started to grow

444
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,520
in terms of number of rows created and

445
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,050
number of covered resources and of

446
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,570
course the number of ORS are actually

447
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:28,060
participating this the interesting

448
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:32,679
things here is up down delegated so you

449
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:36,159
can see it goes 0 0 0 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 1

450
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,930
1 1 1 1 1 etc right so the two actually

451
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,150
went into it and said oh man this is way

452
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:42,880
too hard I'm pulling out so they went

453
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:45,340
ahead and did so the one that's here

454
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,230
actually never finished the job so

455
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,730
there's a multi-step process they did

456
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:51,280
the first step but they're in the

457
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,200
delegated realm since I've done this

458
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,980
there's been a bunch of other

459
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,660
participants

460
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,130
well three others they have actually

461
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:00,630
come into the fold

462
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:04,480
and one of them is Cynthia Revis from

463
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:06,010
who's actually 18 and actually started

464
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,790
playing with a software and actually

465
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:13,000
pulled it down and got it to work so

466
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:14,050
this isn't that hard and y'all can

467
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,310
actually do this

468
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:20,980
the software is is getting up to snuff

469
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:23,139
that the vendor in this case is saying

470
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,880
not quite yet don't use it quite yet but

471
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,950
it's getting pretty close and you can

472
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,150
tell that you can see that these things

473
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:33,820
are starting to occur so let's go ahead

474
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:37,330
and look at the global routing table and

475
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:39,610
you can see here breeze the the color

476
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:43,240
green is the stuff that's valid that's

477
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:45,659
in RPG Island the stuff that's not found

478
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,380
of course is not an RPG on land and

479
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,690
invalid are the things that are

480
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:55,570
misconfigured and yeah we have some of

481
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:58,390
those ripe it's doing quite well you can

482
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:03,550
see there that they have 32 almost 33%

483
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:05,590
they're a ballad AP Nick they're the

484
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,610
originators of RPG I in some ways

485
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,110
they're the ones that sort of led the

486
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,620
pack from the regional registries

487
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:17,020
perspective they're around 50 and a half

488
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:21,760
percent afrinic four and a half or 0.15

489
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:23,530
percent lack Nick around 30 percent and

490
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,760
one of the interesting things about lack

491
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:30,129
Nick here is what they do is that their

492
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:33,520
countries would have various exchanges

493
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:36,310
and they're fairly well connected at the

494
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,800
exchanges and flek Nick will come into

495
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:41,710
the exchange and do a Roth on their our

496
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,950
RPG I wrote on and get the whole entire

497
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,420
country under RPI at that wrote on so

498
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,540
you can see that they've had some fairly

499
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:56,670
good two inroads by doing so and here's

500
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:56,670
an urn what do y'all think

501
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,750
this is yall's region so something for

502
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,610
us to be challenged about and one of the

503
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,590
reasons why we're doing this RP I wrote

504
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,740
on its maybe we can get this number a

505
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:12,060
little bit higher so take ways if you're

506
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,220
not using the RP k you're more

507
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,169
vulnerable to route hijacking there's

508
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,900
plenty of documentation you don't quite

509
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:21,540
get it and hopefully it's on the words I

510
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,970
use like repository rose resource

511
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,040
certificates and so on source start sort

512
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:29,550
of you know getting into that sort of

513
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,110
mindset that you have and the that error

514
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:36,030
staff is more than happy to help you out

515
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:37,679
as you go through this so as I mentioned

516
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:39,240
we're going to have a RPG I wrote on

517
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,360
it's going to be this Wednesday from

518
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:44,310
10:30 to noon in the Bayview room the

519
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,260
objective will be y'all creating rellis

520
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:49,500
yeah the only thing that you have to

521
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:52,170
have is that you need to be have an

522
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,230
errand online account and link to

523
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:56,250
resources now if you want you know hey I

524
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,110
don't want to mess with this some

525
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,120
production we also have an OTA

526
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:02,340
environment that's set up to be very

527
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,199
similar to production that you can use

528
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,929
that one for effect production at all

529
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,530
and if you want to do so we can make

530
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,390
that happen

531
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:11,700
if you want to if you haven't created a

532
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:14,310
role or your errand online that counts

533
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,740
now and you want to create ro us go

534
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:19,980
ahead and do so tonight or early this

535
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,870
tomorrow morning before 10:00 a.m. and

536
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,640
we'll go ahead and replicate the

537
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:26,129
information that's in production into

538
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:29,060
our ot any environment so that you can

539
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:32,400
go ahead and play on Wednesday morning

540
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:35,460
so once you have all this I read the

541
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,310
documentation below and you can actually

542
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,140
suffer a validator while we're doing the

543
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:44,550
wrath on you can actually look at your

544
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:49,710
results so the other question that comes

545
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:51,960
up is what about Aaron's IRR so RPG I

546
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,790
mean it's all kind of confusing hey

547
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,880
what's all this stuff about different

548
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:58,800
ways of securing routing rpki is closer

549
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,230
to real-time route validation whereas

550
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:05,520
IRS used to generate filters sort of a

551
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:07,470
simple like put so and one of the

552
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,240
interesting examples that Danny

553
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,200
Macpherson one of my friends put

554
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:13,200
together is

555
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,499
using the coupling the two together for

556
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,989
better validation of data and over time

557
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:21,149
there's been pretty significant sort of

558
00:24:18,989 --> 00:24:22,859
amount of a religion that goes on hey

559
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:25,678
this is better than that and so on and

560
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:28,678
so forth so there's a so we wanted to

561
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:31,679
open it for all so you wanna use IRR can

562
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:35,639
use IRR if you guys use RPI you can use

563
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,999
RP cally if you want to put IRR into our

564
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:41,428
pikia excuse me if you want to put our

565
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:45,230
PKI into IRR we'll probably do that as

566
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:48,840
well so IRR it's been around for decades

567
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:51,149
it's been it was published in 1994 it's

568
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,059
had varying degrees of success a good

569
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:56,729
friend of mine actually said that he

570
00:24:54,059 --> 00:25:02,279
claims 0 slash 0 & 1 in the early days

571
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:05,159
of right and and so it's had some sort

572
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:08,820
of pros and cons and it's much better

573
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:10,769
now Aran's IRR we're using a very old

574
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,359
software is bolted to the side of

575
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:14,460
parents infrastructure it's definitely

576
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:17,668
showing sage is a customer friendly as

577
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,379
we want it to be there's a bunch of

578
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:22,639
suggestions that the community is asked

579
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:25,019
to put out to actually fix the IRR and

580
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:28,379
their community we put our community

581
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:30,330
consultation and they've asked us to go

582
00:25:28,379 --> 00:25:33,658
ahead and actually make the IRR better

583
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,939
so right now I our artisan in

584
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:38,639
development and we were going putting in

585
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:42,299
base level service this year we're going

586
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:45,719
to have a web interface available in

587
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:47,389
June 2020 and phase 2 where we'll have a

588
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,580
restful interface and so on of

589
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:54,899
complementing the this week will be

590
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:58,559
finished in December 2020 so the themes

591
00:25:54,899 --> 00:26:00,840
of the new IR is promoting the validity

592
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:04,799
of IRR data right now if you look at our

593
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:07,859
IR R its kind of hit or miss we're going

594
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,960
to provide appropriate proxy

595
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:12,449
registration services we've introduced

596
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:17,070
the idea of routing contacts within Erin

597
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:18,629
online so you can go ahead and if the

598
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,730
organization doesn't want you to

599
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:21,889
actually muck with their organizational

600
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:24,230
information or anything else

601
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:27,320
we actually set it up that router

602
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:31,340
routing context can only deal with RPI

603
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,720
and IRR we also have DNS contacts for

604
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,240
those people who want to deal with the

605
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,070
reverse and they can only play with the

606
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,280
reverse part of the tree so we've

607
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:41,270
actually set that up we're going to

608
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,389
integrate and invalidate the

609
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:46,160
registration database to make it of

610
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:48,080
valid and cross-reference our Fekkai

611
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,430
work when it's appropriate in the final

612
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,080
part that we're going to be working with

613
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:53,600
the other regional registry is caught

614
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,850
the cross sonication schemes because

615
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,750
many of you cross various regional

616
00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:02,510
registries we're also simplifying the RP

617
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:05,300
SL language around like doing a subset

618
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:06,740
of the objects that are out there we're

619
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:11,750
going to make some restful services out

620
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:13,790
of them make it simple and integrate IR

621
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:17,930
functions basically putting a web

622
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:20,180
interface on IRR as well and collaborate

623
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:23,840
with other regional registries as I

624
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:26,420
mentioned on cross authentication so I

625
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:35,060
think I've finished and I have three

626
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:37,100
minutes to spare so any questions I dug

627
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,780
montgomery last time I saw you talk

628
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,330
about this you are going to cross

629
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:43,700
populate IRR data

630
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:46,610
I'm sorry rpki data enter out objects to

631
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:49,490
a plan that is something that's been

632
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:51,399
discussed and we hope to do yes but that

633
00:27:49,490 --> 00:28:01,970
probably won't be happening this year

634
00:27:51,400 --> 00:28:08,300
probably happening in next year yes

635
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:11,090
rüdiger rüdiger photogenic um mark you

636
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:13,700
would not be surprised if I point back

637
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:17,629
to your I think it was the first bullet

638
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,430
saying all of the iron rpki is publicly

639
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:23,630
available

640
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:26,930
how should I read that so so you can

641
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:29,570
actually pull down a repo with no

642
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:32,690
authentic you know no you don't you can

643
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:35,530
just pull it down there's no access

644
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,530
control in the repo

645
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:42,879
okay so the truth of the matter is the

646
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:46,750
essential information that allows to

647
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:50,440
validate that we got the right data is

648
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:53,950
not public so I think you're talking

649
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:58,510
about the towel is that correct I think

650
00:28:53,950 --> 00:29:00,370
you are correct so I say the OD me tell

651
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:02,230
is actually published on the website so

652
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:05,229
one does not have to follow any

653
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,640
agreement using OT need to tell so if

654
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,620
you have any issue with that

655
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,930
particularly agreement you can still

656
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:17,550
play with Aaron online within OTA so so

657
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,550
you have the opportunity to do so

658
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:25,570
is it me Frederick from Amazon Web

659
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,700
Services by talking for myself yes so

660
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:29,439
the statistics you have between are in

661
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,870
their ripe do you think that perhaps

662
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,520
Aaron has something to do with that the

663
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,949
adoption is quite low in the Aaron

664
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:40,629
region like for example consider making

665
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:41,860
it easier to register OS so actually one

666
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,200
of the things that's very nice about

667
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,870
ripe is you do couple your meetings

668
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:51,130
together and we do that once a year

669
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:55,209
ourselves between nanog and Aaron and so

670
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:57,400
you see that synergy that that frankly I

671
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,050
think it's I we can do a better job with

672
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,290
enarans region to actually have a

673
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:04,720
synergy to make these things happen

674
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:06,550
there's also that is something that

675
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,130
we're working on trying to overhaul our

676
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:11,440
RPG I sort of infrastructure we're

677
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,730
trying to make it more user friendly and

678
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,500
this one of the things that we're going

679
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:18,880
to be doing as part of modernization

680
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:22,360
Margaret modernizing our our RP guy set

681
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,500
of services yeah so I hope you still

682
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,449
think you're right on that but do you

683
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,520
have any timelines or any commitments or

684
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,410
because I do think that their

685
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,250
inexperience in terms of pounding hromas

686
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:34,990
is the worst of all there are ours okay

687
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:38,560
okay maybe we can talk about this

688
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:40,240
offline because there's nursin you're

689
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:44,610
asking sort of a big question

690
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,610
okay absolutely okay thank you

691
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,389
well thank you very much

692
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,389
[Applause]
