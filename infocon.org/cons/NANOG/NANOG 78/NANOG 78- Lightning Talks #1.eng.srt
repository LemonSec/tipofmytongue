1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,690
okay good afternoon Thank You Kat real

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:08,490
quick I'm gonna do a five probably six

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,559
minute presentation on fraud reporting

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,940
and investigation at Aaron of time for a

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,190
couple of questions will fit in the ten

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,260
minute total slot so let me start right

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,939
in here

8
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,920
you've heard about individual incidents

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,350
so like if there's a major event you

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,439
might hear about it but the last time we

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,680
reported on that a major fraud situation

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,590
where someone managed to effectively get

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,750
it resources improperly I noticed that

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,370
some people didn't weren't aware of what

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,769
we're doing in general so this is the

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:41,669
general process for how we handle fraud

17
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,780
reporting and investigation at Aaron so

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,600
why does it matter

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,760
well we're registry the whole purpose is

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,440
to provide accurate information

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,760
if the registry is full of inaccurate

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,579
information you might as well not have a

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,070
registry so it's a core function for us

24
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,809
it's essential to the mission we've

25
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,800
pretty much been an enormous amount of

26
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,510
time working on issues related to fraud

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,899
that though a lot of it is not visible

28
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,630
in general so let's see let's talk about

29
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,530
how we handle this since 2008 we've had

30
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,149
a formal process for reporting fraud so

31
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,590
before that you could talk to us and it

32
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,990
wasn't really formalized we didn't

33
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,850
necessarily track things but since 2008

34
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,179
there's a formal fraud reporting process

35
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,850
and it's our preferred way of receiving

36
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,340
reports I'll talk about why that is but

37
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,439
at a high level if you're going to

38
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,619
report internet number resources for

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,158
Darren we'd like you to do it this way

40
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,409
I'll explain why it's pretty simple so

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,119
if you go to the website Aaron reference

42
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,700
tools fraud report you can also do the

43
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,950
menus to navigate to it I click on that

44
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,829
and it provides a form that describes

45
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,750
what number of resources you think are

46
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,669
incorrect in the database ie

47
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,189
have been obtained fraudulently have

48
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,549
been transferred fraudulently or are now

49
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,839
in active use by someone who's not the

50
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,490
right owner and doesn't have the rights

51
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,610
they've effectively hijacked the use of

52
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,519
the numbers and the why well will ticket

53
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,410
that will treat that as a request we

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,940
investigate it we track it the

55
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,150
information that we

56
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,370
to track it is all formalized now some

57
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,960
of you know Aaron's staff some of you

58
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,730
send the email to Aaron's staff saying

59
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,430
hey you should look at this number and

60
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,829
depending on who you send it to they may

61
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,260
look into something they may refer to

62
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,450
their manager they may open up a fraud

63
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,459
report but they may not and by the way

64
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,410
when three of you reported to three

65
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,480
different staff members I have three

66
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:40,290
different staff members all looking at

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,970
the same tickets at the same time when

68
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,450
if you make a fraud report I'll have it

69
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,520
happened once so it really is preferred

70
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:49,019
it means that we actually track it we

71
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,150
all know what's going on

72
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,130
we don't have duplication if someone

73
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,510
else reports a similar one we can

74
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,880
immediately tie back into the

75
00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:02,850
investigation now what's the alternative

76
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:05,700
so talk to us you know email helpdesk

77
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,560
ticket on wwr net email host master at

78
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,049
aaron net sent an email to the aaron

79
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,520
staff call the helpdesk show up at the

80
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,090
helpdesk that we run at the various

81
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,980
conferences any of those will also

82
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,459
result in us looking into a problem but

83
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,679
may not result in a fraud ticket and may

84
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,270
not result in a formal investigation we

85
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,190
have a lot of things going on if you

86
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,620
don't think it warrants opening a ticket

87
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,170
with us through the fraud report form we

88
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,180
may not decide it warrants investigation

89
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,859
now clearly you report to something to

90
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,230
us that's substantial and something that

91
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,780
has good evidence we kick off an

92
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,690
investigation and we'll do that if we

93
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,840
see the same information show up on an

94
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:49,910
operator mailing lists like nanog show

95
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:53,400
up in a security blog or security

96
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:55,709
mailing lists for security mitigation or

97
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,420
an RI our mailing list we we do pay

98
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,980
attention to these and if we see a

99
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,380
substantial incident that has good

100
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,859
documentation will actually open up on

101
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,810
our own a resource for review and take a

102
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,970
look at what's going on but you're not

103
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,640
assured of that unless you use the fraud

104
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,080
reporting form also the other thing

105
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,059
about the fraud reporting form is that

106
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,480
we provide a quarterly report on the

107
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,260
website of every ticket opened and what

108
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,680
happened to it

109
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,719
now if you look at the quarterly report

110
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,240
so you can go Aaron website you'll see

111
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,009
that

112
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,949
most of the tickets say out of scope out

113
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:33,600
of scope out of scope out of scope one

114
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:35,220
of them will say Oh inappropriate

115
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,340
obtained record reverted to the original

116
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,280
party out of scope out of scope under

117
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,979
investigation the out of scope ones are

118
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,549
mostly people reporting spam or phishing

119
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:50,190
or something else they're saying this

120
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,180
address block is sending bad traffic

121
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:56,430
doing naughty things not Aaron's job

122
00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:00,150
internet number fraud reporting is about

123
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:02,280
a number resource block being assigned

124
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,500
to the wrong party being transferred to

125
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,900
the wrong party someone successfully

126
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,240
coming in and hijacking the entry for a

127
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,489
block it's about who has the rights to

128
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,740
number resources we are not the internet

129
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,240
police a lot of people are really quick

130
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,520
to say that and I'm very quick as well

131
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,490
we're not the internet police but we do

132
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,979
police the registry we are not the ones

133
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,960
you report your spam to your abuse your

134
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:28,099
other that's up to you ISPs to work out

135
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,419
among yourself so types of fraud

136
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:33,630
attempts to change registration data

137
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:41,570
improperly people who very carefully

138
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:44,669
change fizzbin LLC to fizzbin ink to

139
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:46,710
fizzbin DBA and then eventually tie it

140
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:49,770
to their brothers company and take the

141
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,659
number resources false information

142
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:52,799
provided for purposes of tainting number

143
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:55,289
of resources people who sent an

144
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,599
application in and they're falsifying

145
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,919
their requests they literally are

146
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:01,710
talking about infrastructure they don't

147
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:04,020
have or pass the dress blocks they've

148
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,719
been assigned which they haven't been to

149
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,310
make their request valid and then theft

150
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,159
of number resources through identity

151
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,470
theft literally we ask someone

152
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:15,509
oh you're Tim Smith yes I'm Tim Smith

153
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,310
send us your driver's license and they

154
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,289
send us a copy of a Tim Smith's driver's

155
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,449
license why well they went to the

156
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:23,729
phonebook and found five Tim Smith's and

157
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:25,830
one of them for a hundred bucks was

158
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:28,159
willing to say I'll give you a copy of

159
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:31,289
my driver's license so we have people

160
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:34,740
stepping in on other people's identity

161
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:37,919
so that they can then step in and hijack

162
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:41,070
number resources by being the CEO

163
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,810
or the VP of AI of IT these are all

164
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,080
fraud report any if you have any cases

165
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:48,210
you have things like that report them so

166
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,419
what happens we assign an analyst we

167
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,680
make changes to the records we note all

168
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,930
the changes that have been on all the

169
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,400
documents all the tickets everything

170
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,960
that went into the change we put in

171
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,260
place and then we have an internal

172
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:04,560
review of it what will happen if it

173
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:08,640
turns out that it was fraud will revert

174
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,460
the changes folks if you get a number

175
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,430
resource from Aaron through a transfer

176
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,039
or get assigned and you used fraud to do

177
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,830
it it will evaporate on you we will

178
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,040
revert the changes okay it's that simple

179
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,650
your application to us says it was an

180
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,270
honest application so if it wasn't we

181
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,190
would you just revert it and if you

182
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,349
don't like that you can you know you can

183
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,360
try to address that in any recourse you

184
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,270
want in court or whatever but not our

185
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,160
problem so do not apply for resources

186
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,990
fraudulently do not transfer resources

187
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,500
fraudulently it will go right out from

188
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,430
under you

189
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,080
I don't care sorry we'll lock records if

190
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,390
we have a dispute and we have disputes

191
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,630
now and then party broke into two

192
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:54,330
different pieces and no one really said

193
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:56,280
who got the address block rights okay

194
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,109
and then their dispute about it a lot of

195
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,750
times we just lock the records we lock

196
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,940
it okay you to work it out on your own

197
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,660
or work it out in the court system tell

198
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,570
us when you're done

199
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:09,390
and so sometimes that's what we end up

200
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:11,700
doing initiating customer audits

201
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:13,710
sometimes we don't have fraud but we

202
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,170
have good evidence that something's

203
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,729
closed and we'll go contact that entity

204
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,890
and say look you have a lot of

205
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,630
suspicious transfers or assignments and

206
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,950
we're into a resource review we're gonna

207
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,980
do a full audit of your number of

208
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:28,080
resources try to be careful about that

209
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,390
because you know you're all businesses

210
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,728
you don't want one guy ddossing another

211
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:34,319
with Aaron audits so we really only do

212
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,330
this if there's credible evidence that

213
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,670
the audits going to show something and

214
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,010
reporting illegal to law enforcement we

215
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:42,900
do this if you actually in the process

216
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,300
of getting number resources violate the

217
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,610
law commit fraud wire fraud you'll be

218
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,589
reported to law enforcement law

219
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,690
enforcement takes an active interest in

220
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,100
these things they spoke at the last

221
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:56,760
some of the people we work with everyday

222
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:59,190
spoke at the last an odd meeting and you

223
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,260
can end up being indicted on wire fraud

224
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,580
it has happened there's a party running

225
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,680
around with twenty counts against them

226
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,940
right now that is going through the

227
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:11,939
system so that's kind of it we do spend

228
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,650
a lot of time dealing with this we try

229
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,770
to be transparent we do provide

230
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:19,560
reporting but if you as a community want

231
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,870
us to publicly say why a particular

232
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,790
resource is correct or not correct

233
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,280
we're probably unable to do that because

234
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,770
realistically there's NDA's and the

235
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,510
information involved and there's some

236
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,880
protections we need to do to make sure

237
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:36,360
we don't expose Aaron to libel and

238
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:39,240
slander that's it that's the whole

239
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,670
process I might have 20 seconds for

240
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,890
questions so if anyone wants to ask one

241
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:48,150
or two questions and run to the mic you

242
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,960
can do it I see none thank you for your

243
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:53,769
time

244
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:58,220
[Applause]

245
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:59,269
thank you John so next we have John

246
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,149
Christophe

247
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:10,519
he is a PhD student and researcher at

248
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:12,410
DePaul University slight correction cat

249
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:13,550
actually the researcher part is that at

250
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:16,759
UIC but that's no big deal

251
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,899
so there's my bio I'm John the people

252
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:19,819
that I'm working with this project honor

253
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:21,829
below I'll try to make this as quickly

254
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:24,019
as possible so he leaves any time that

255
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,819
may be needed for Q&A and not to

256
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:28,850
trespass on the time of the lightning

257
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:30,469
talk to follow so many of you are very

258
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,269
familiar with rpki especially lately

259
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,730
this has been a hot topic so I'm just

260
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:35,930
going to very briefly just remind you

261
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,870
that there's three essential components

262
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:40,550
to the rpki on your left there's the

263
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,769
repositories or trust anchors these

264
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,649
essentially the IRS that have all the

265
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:47,720
rows in the middle this is all the

266
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:49,309
relying party software the cache servers

267
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,259
this is the stuff that synchronizes the

268
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:52,850
row is grabs them and does the

269
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:55,040
validation so that it can pass it on to

270
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,629
those things on the right those routers

271
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,998
where you can do your router origin

272
00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:00,860
validation there's been a number of

273
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:02,660
studies that have looked at who's

274
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,040
publishing row is and how many rowers

275
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,629
are out there and which regions are

276
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,829
publishing the most row is and so forth

277
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:08,329
and there's been some studies that are

278
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:09,979
where people are looking out who's

279
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:12,170
actually doing route validation and we

280
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,139
hear about people seems weekly now

281
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:17,389
who've who are starting to reject or

282
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:20,300
drop routes that are invalid

283
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:22,850
so that stuff has been looked at a fair

284
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,620
amount already about what seems to be a

285
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,870
missing piece is that that thing in the

286
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,819
middle what what's happening there at

287
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,309
those caching servers that's what we're

288
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:33,410
kind of interested in so the question is

289
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:35,120
are those caching servers consistent you

290
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,389
might have to have some sub questions to

291
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,920
that and if they're not you know why not

292
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:42,290
you might modify that question slightly

293
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,329
because of the way that the rpki works

294
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,910
there's some delay so you might say

295
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:49,160
what's reasonably consistent and what

296
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:51,319
effect if it's unreasonably consistent

297
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,559
would that have on your actual your

298
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:56,899
routing tables on your validation so

299
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,980
here's what we're doing we're trying to

300
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:02,209
get access logs to or from the

301
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,279
repositories so that IRR essentially

302
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:06,689
look at who's grabbing

303
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,709
or who's doing the synchronization of

304
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:11,819
the row is looking at essentially the IP

305
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,050
addresses that are doing that what

306
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:14,790
they're grabbing the frequency the

307
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,889
intervals and all that trying to then

308
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,870
synthesize that data make sense of it

309
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:21,540
analyze it and then produce maybe some

310
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,850
useful results so I'm just gonna show

311
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,230
you a few brief pictures really quick

312
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,300
and the the graphs and the charts aren't

313
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,970
necessarily something you should really

314
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,139
focus in on as being really seeing a

315
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:33,629
whole lot but just to give you an idea

316
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:36,600
of what we're trying to actually do this

317
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:38,430
is just kind of a taste so I know in the

318
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,319
back some of these slides are very maybe

319
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,378
hard to see but again the numbers don't

320
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,519
necessarily matter but we're looking at

321
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:46,230
the method of synchronization is

322
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,660
essentially to you will either do our

323
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:51,749
sync RDP which is essentially our sync

324
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:55,170
but specific to our PTI who's doing what

325
00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:57,749
maybe you're doing both we're looking at

326
00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:01,229
the our arts themselves who's accessing

327
00:12:57,749 --> 00:13:03,089
those you know the number of caching

328
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:06,259
servers that are accessing them may vary

329
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:09,509
that may be a sign of inconsistency

330
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:11,220
we're looking at the actual cache server

331
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:14,490
population itself how many people are

332
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,800
actually pulling row is from the

333
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,139
repositories this graph is a little bit

334
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,149
old now but at roughly the time there

335
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:23,189
was maybe five hundred plus or so that

336
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:24,779
number might be higher now that and

337
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:28,649
we're differentiate based on the access

338
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:29,970
method and then when you start doing all

339
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,680
this stuff the thing that really kind of

340
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,120
answers part of that consistency

341
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,680
question is you know what are the

342
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,709
differences is we have a view into the

343
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,019
cache servers are they all reasonably

344
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:41,699
consistent and the short answer is so

345
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,809
far as well not exactly some of them are

346
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:44,490
a little bit different some of them

347
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:46,350
don't have the same information or not

348
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,670
getting the same information maybe

349
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,709
there's one set of cache servers that

350
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:52,319
just aren't synchronizing from one of

351
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:53,849
the irr s why we may not be able to

352
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:55,290
answer that question but at least we if

353
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,649
we identify that that might tell

354
00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:00,689
something about how how validation is

355
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:03,389
actually being affected by this so

356
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:05,550
that's kind of what we're doing there's

357
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:06,929
some add-on work I came into this work a

358
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,758
little bit later but this is some of the

359
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:12,749
stuff that I started doing as well as

360
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:15,269
looking at the trying to get not only a

361
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:18,120
view at the repositories that the access

362
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:19,260
is there but also the cache servers

363
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,420
themselves

364
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,360
can I can we get more information from

365
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,949
those of you who run those some of those

366
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,380
are open so I might be able to rsync

367
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:30,750
maybe directly off you or or look could

368
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,060
get a look with the RPK router protocol

369
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,320
to see if you'll give me a copy of

370
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,420
what's in your cache that might be

371
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,550
interesting you might not want me to do

372
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:41,160
that I would prefer and so this is to

373
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:44,250
ask for you now if you would be willing

374
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,319
to let me look at your cash in some way

375
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,880
through logs or give a read-only feed

376
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,580
that would be lovely

377
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,750
I'd be very anxious to talk to you if

378
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:55,080
that's something you might be willing to

379
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,760
do that'll just help inform whether you

380
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:01,260
know we can determine with more accuracy

381
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,939
the caches are consistent but but I am

382
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,110
trying to actually do this without your

383
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,430
help as well so going around maybe

384
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,560
looking to see if I can discover any

385
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,300
that may be publicly accessible there's

386
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,790
a couple ways to do that so when I just

387
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,050
sort of enumerate those briefly here we

388
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,959
can talk about more if you have

389
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:18,689
questions or offline so that's roughly

390
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,300
it hopefully that was nice and lightning

391
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,430
enough for you here's my contact info if

392
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,949
you have any specific questions that you

393
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,989
don't care to ask here will be available

394
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:37,520
for the rest of the weekend Anna thank

395
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:37,520
you very much let's take one question I

396
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:46,490
Tony Tobruk Comcast I was talking to

397
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:49,110
someone who's operating such and said I

398
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:51,210
asked about the cache consistency and

399
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,400
they said oh it seems to be pretty good

400
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,850
even among a couple of different like

401
00:15:53,400 --> 00:16:01,319
the right validator and righta Nader

402
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:03,960
and then another comment was that the

403
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,520
router seems to deal with the union of

404
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,620
those two so if you've got a router

405
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:11,010
that's getting information from multiple

406
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,290
caches the consistency may be in effect

407
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:15,930
is the less of a problem yeah and and

408
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,670
I'm not sure that we're gonna see much

409
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,979
of a difference between the

410
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,610
implementation types of the the ruling

411
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,260
party software

412
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,540
it's like righta Nader versus ripe or

413
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,130
what have you but we do see differences

414
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,069
how they might be set up and configured

415
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:30,450
like so sometimes we see some of them

416
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,990
synchronizing like every 15 seconds

417
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,640
versus 10 minutes versus 30

418
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,649
to whatever so you see some of those

419
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,390
differences as well and that may not

420
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:39,070
have an unreasonable effect on

421
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,140
synchronization just for the reasons you

422
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:44,800
sight in but we're really interested in

423
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:46,480
whether someone is not synchronizing for

424
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:53,250
something where there's long outages or

425
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,250
that sort of thing all right thanks

426
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,029
[Applause]

427
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:11,689
thank you next we have tio vas with the

428
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,689
next year

429
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:17,368
hello guys thank you very much my name

430
00:17:15,388 --> 00:17:20,758
is tio I'm head of network engineering

431
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:21,958
for nexium from Europe actually and I

432
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:24,839
would like to talk about routing

433
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,039
security today but this time I would

434
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,720
like to talk about a feature which is

435
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:30,899
bringing you but it's also pretty easy

436
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:36,119
to use and can really help us to make

437
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:38,340
fine route leaks way easier so currently

438
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:40,678
all the route service I'm aware of

439
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,499
do pass validate do origin validation

440
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:45,690
they use IRR data they use air PKI data

441
00:17:43,499 --> 00:17:49,200
but there's almost no pause validation

442
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,970
except for some really advanced carriers

443
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,090
and high speeds using features like pia

444
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:56,009
lock but as you might agree there are

445
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,928
certain ASNs which should never be

446
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:00,240
visible via route service for example

447
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:03,330
Agia want providers or networks never

448
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,610
participating by a route service but

449
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:07,408
currently and this is a pity there's no

450
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,939
single source of information about these

451
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:11,580
networks and these networks means

452
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,710
networks not participating or which

453
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:17,249
should not be visible at all over the

454
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:18,869
route service but unfortunately and I

455
00:18:17,249 --> 00:18:20,700
took this screenshot this morning from

456
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:23,480
our dkx connected router in Frankfurt

457
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,669
there are plenty of routes we receive

458
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:29,039
which contain tier 1 providers or a SS

459
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:31,259
which should not be visible in in rots

460
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,369
for example here you have NTT we have

461
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:37,080
dodged telecom and we have cogent and

462
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:39,928
this list is not complete so we see many

463
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,840
many routes of these types from large

464
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:47,519
operators t1 providers and non routes

465
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,619
were participating a essence and since a

466
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,019
few days actually a couple weeks there's

467
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:53,908
a new feature available in peering a

468
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:56,249
beam and I'm not affiliated appearing to

469
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:58,799
be by the way which is called never via

470
00:18:56,249 --> 00:19:01,980
route service and as you can see on the

471
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,168
right side in the red box there's a new

472
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,659
checkbox called neighbor viroid service

473
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:08,129
which where you as a peer or as a

474
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:10,710
maintainer of a record appearing to be

475
00:19:08,129 --> 00:19:12,539
can indicate if you're a network or your

476
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:15,539
routes advertised should be visible on

477
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:18,330
route service at all this is an opt-in

478
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:20,220
feature should by default set defaults

479
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,980
but you can set it to true and indicate

480
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,809
to others that Europe should not be

481
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,600
visible the feature is appear in

482
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:30,178
divisions version 2.18 and as of today

483
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,830
on all the internet exchanges the

484
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:34,529
company I work for is participating

485
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:38,970
eight networks so far have it up to this

486
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:41,730
feature and you can really easy use this

487
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,100
feature by using the peering db-api you

488
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:46,710
can deepen DPI API call to get all the

489
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,928
networks all the exchanges your network

490
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,760
is taking part of that's the call on the

491
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:54,419
lower side of the slide gives you all

492
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:57,240
the IDS of these internet exchanges and

493
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:59,340
from that place you can grab all the AAS

494
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,580
numbers which have said never buy out

495
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,649
service to true this list is not

496
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:10,350
complete but currently as said eight

497
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:12,750
networks do this so what we do as an

498
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:15,178
axiom since about two two and two and a

499
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,460
half weeks is we on a daily basis

500
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:19,440
generate filters based on these API

501
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,260
calls on this appearing to be entries

502
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,389
and publish these filters to all our IX

503
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:28,320
connected routers and we're now dropping

504
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:34,260
all these aass from routes where this

505
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:37,350
ASN is part of the pass and if you do

506
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,870
peer with an air route server if you do

507
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:42,059
use peer peering maybe and if you do not

508
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,129
want to have your routes distributed

509
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:46,769
over the route server please go to

510
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:49,409
peering TB and just quickly press that

511
00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:51,600
button and check that box and if you

512
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:54,240
don't filter yet please do it please use

513
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,549
that capability or that feature in order

514
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:01,440
to drop routes peers do not want to

515
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:03,950
advertise overawed service that's it any

516
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,950
