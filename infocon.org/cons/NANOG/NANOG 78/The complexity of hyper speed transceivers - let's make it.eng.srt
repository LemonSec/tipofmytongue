1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,629
perfect good morning everybody see a lot

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,760
of fresh faces grave my name is Thomas

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:10,739
Thomas Whaley I'm co-founder and CTO

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,559
efflux optics a company which is

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,410
specialized in pluggable transceivers

6
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,710
especially the optical ones and in my

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,600
daily job actually I really work quite a

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,750
lot with transceivers and the optical

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,939
components there but also in the

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,500
counterpart people our network engineers

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,320
and I helped them to design and build

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,510
optical networks when I look a little

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,790
bit backwards in history looking at the

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:39,690
networks we have built 10 years ago I

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,960
see a slightly change now also looking

16
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,149
at yesterday's presentation the

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,489
complexity and the network itself got

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,520
way bigger and/or the network itself got

19
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,538
way more complex the same we can see

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,879
also an optical transceivers when we

21
00:00:53,539 --> 00:01:01,879
compare like let's say 10 years ago 10

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:04,408
gigabit was somehow a new technology and

23
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:06,658
starting to be implemented in the field

24
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,299
now in these days Hannon pick up it

25
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,400
becomes when you becomes commodity and

26
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,220
for honey gigabit is the leading edge

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,860
technology actually so this taught our

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,869
covers at the end of the day the

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,180
complexity of the transceivers itself

30
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,220
because in parallel what we see in the

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,590
network that the complexity grab the

32
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,679
same happen to a transceiver so what I

33
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,180
brought there for you is a comparison of

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,600
a 10 kick trans even a fornicate

35
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,579
transceiver I opened them up for you and

36
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,579
on the top this is an SP plus and below

37
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,979
you see a Q as of PDD opened up remove

38
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,439
the housing I don't want to talk about

39
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,780
it and kick any longer so the talk

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,000
mainly covers three components inside

41
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,920
this transceiver first of all the

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,479
transmitter and receiver section these

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,610
tiny golden boxes like here and then

44
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:58,829
this new introduced component the DSP or

45
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,820
digital signal processor I go this is

46
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,679
going to be at the end of the

47
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,258
presentation so let's start with the

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,909
transmitter section to give a rough idea

49
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,369
what's happening inside of that

50
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,319
transmitter so this golden box when we

51
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,680
open it up it's first of all an empty

52
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,649
golden box

53
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,349
in the optical environment this is also

54
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:21,500
called a Tosa to transmitter optical sap

55
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:23,149
assembly and you will see now why it's a

56
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,019
SUP assembly because we have to fill

57
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:29,840
that golden box with some components for

58
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:32,329
your imagination this box has a

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,000
dimension of 5 by 10 millimeters so it's

60
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:36,769
quite small and we start with the

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,959
electrical connector added at the back

62
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:41,000
actually which connects to the PCB of

63
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,159
the transceiver itself and that's where

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,739
we feel in four lanes of high-speed

65
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:47,298
signal for a hundred or four and a

66
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:49,180
gigabit transceiver at the end of the

67
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:51,500
day the Choza looks pretty much the same

68
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,989
we have four lanes feeding into that

69
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,919
Tosa getting the high-speed signal on

70
00:02:53,989 --> 00:03:00,169
the electrical side so first of all for

71
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,400
sure we've talked about optics so first

72
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:04,819
of all we have to convert that

73
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,079
electrical signal into an optical light

74
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:08,358
level and that's typically done with

75
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:10,969
laser diodes pretty straightforward

76
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:12,889
everyone knows them and those laser

77
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:14,870
diodes have basically two interesting

78
00:03:12,889 --> 00:03:17,989
characteristics first of all they take

79
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,569
current current to operate and this

80
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:23,180
current is going to heat them up now

81
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:25,010
this current at the end of the day when

82
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,620
they heat up it has a side effect that

83
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,060
the wavelength of the emitted light is

84
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,859
going to drift a little bit when the

85
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,180
temperature is changing and that's

86
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:35,840
something what we really are want to

87
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,699
avoid in optical engineering actually we

88
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,519
want to keep the wavelength stabilized

89
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:43,939
to a certain spot because otherwise when

90
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:46,759
it's going to drift away the laser is

91
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:49,970
not in focus any longer and then your

92
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:52,339
transmission will fail to do that we use

93
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:55,519
a cooler this cooler again takes current

94
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:58,310
to cool down or to keep the laser diode

95
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,849
on a certain temperature and with the

96
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:03,590
result to have a stable wavelength the

97
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:06,500
second characteristic of that laser

98
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,659
diode is the light which is emitted is

99
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,579
let's say it's blurring out it's not

100
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:12,168
really focused pretty much like people

101
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,639
are wearing glasses when they take off

102
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,859
their glasses they that they don't see

103
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,889
properly and the same applies to a laser

104
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:20,779
so like in real world on humans we wear

105
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:23,659
glasses a laser need also to wear

106
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,820
glasses we place their optical lenses in

107
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:27,710
total we are talking about four lenses

108
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,880
because we have four lasers inside

109
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:35,000
they're driving for electrical lanes of

110
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,710
the high-speed signal and to give you a

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,070
rough idea about those optical lenses

112
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:42,020
they're the sizes and XY set it's around

113
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,930
0.5 millimeters so they're pretty small

114
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:48,169
and in production phase these lenses

115
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:51,560
need to first of all be placed in X Y Z

116
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:53,840
to be in focus to the laser itself that

117
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,120
we get a proper signal and this is done

118
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,250
in 50 nanometer steps to move it and

119
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,210
wobbling around 850 nanometer steps and

120
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,460
then we have to fix it there and that's

121
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,469
not a big challenge actually this is

122
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,780
typically done with UV hardening glue

123
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,210
now you can imagine first of all this

124
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:15,619
glue needs some certain characteristics

125
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:17,960
especially when it comes to the lifetime

126
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,360
of a transceiver it'll last for at least

127
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,229
five or ten years so this glue needs to

128
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:27,350
keep his conscious T for the 5 or 10

129
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:29,390
years and can't change its behavior also

130
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,340
over the operating temperature range of

131
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,590
the transceiver itself and if it would

132
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,239
do though the lenses would shift and

133
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,239
then the laser would be out of focus

134
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,190
again so this is quite a little bit

135
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,870
chemistry is also involved a to have to

136
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:46,370
write glue for for that application so

137
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,870
what we have now is we have focused

138
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,410
light coming out of those four lenses

139
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,930
but actually they wouldn't they would

140
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,550
hit the wall here but we need to insert

141
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,640
them into the receptacle this is the

142
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:00,560
typical receptacle for a LC block now

143
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,050
you can also see dimensions

144
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,060
that's a receptor where you plug in the

145
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:06,620
LC plug and it's quite big here on the

146
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:11,270
screen but when you see it in real field

147
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:13,100
it's a tiny part to combine all the four

148
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,469
wavelengths this is done with an optical

149
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,850
multiplexer and some of you might be

150
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,920
familiar with my optic almighty

151
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,950
multiplex so you know them as a 1u

152
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:25,880
chassis thingy having a door 16 channel

153
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:28,640
in CWDM or 20 or 40 channel in DWDM now

154
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:34,400
here in this situation we have a 4

155
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:37,580
channel CW or LAN WB max which combines

156
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,279
all the four wavelengths together that

157
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,438
we take on a hoops

158
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:44,839
that they gonna be inserted into it

159
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:47,209
acceptable how does this max work its

160
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:50,809
filter block and it's pretty much

161
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:52,579
physics from high school so it's based

162
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:54,319
on the principle of a mirror and this is

163
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,139
an angled mirror so the light is

164
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,459
inserted into that filter plot and this

165
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,169
surface there is thought that it's not a

166
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:02,509
class and it's also a little bit it has

167
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:03,948
an angle so that the light is reflected

168
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,839
pretty much like when you take a ball

169
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:07,279
and throw it against the wall it's gonna

170
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,719
balance back the same happens with light

171
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,308
here as well oh when you look in the

172
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:12,558
morning into the mirror you most

173
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:17,089
probably see a proper face the same

174
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:19,999
happens inside this marks so the light

175
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:22,189
is bouncing back and forward and at each

176
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:24,679
step a new wavelength is adding to depth

177
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:26,300
to that light path and then at this

178
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:29,779
certain spot down here it's gonna be

179
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:33,050
released into the receptacle so now we

180
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:34,699
are on the fiber on the couple of

181
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,819
kilometres or more than 100 kilometers

182
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:40,069
doesn't matter and then we on the other

183
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:43,369
side we hit the receiver the receiver

184
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:44,989
again it's not it's an it's not a golden

185
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:47,239
box now it's a gray box but it doesn't

186
00:07:44,989 --> 00:07:49,219
matter it's an empty one again and what

187
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:50,779
is inside in the receiver so first of

188
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,748
all yes the light is coming into the

189
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:55,909
receptacle into that call this gray box

190
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:59,779
and now we have to actually we have to

191
00:07:55,909 --> 00:08:01,069
separate all the four wavelengths again

192
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,449
this is typically viewed on the

193
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:04,579
demultiplexer it works the other way

194
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:08,089
around like the multiplexer it separates

195
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:09,739
all the four wavelengths and besides the

196
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:12,050
fact that we do have a filter block here

197
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:14,479
which only allows the green light to

198
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,099
pass and the other colors are going to

199
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,829
be bounced back and forward until they

200
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:20,899
hit the appropriate filter up to the

201
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:22,759
yellow one down here and we have

202
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:25,550
separated all the four wavelengths again

203
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:27,739
and then we need again optical lenses

204
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:30,319
the other way around like on the laser

205
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:32,568
side to get the light coming out of the

206
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,938
filter block which is not focused

207
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:37,878
properly you need to be focused to hit a

208
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:38,620
pin diet this diet that's the other way

209
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,089
around

210
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,099
compared to the laser diet it converts

211
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:44,269
the optical light level to electrical

212
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,160
level now

213
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:48,470
the electrical level coming out of that

214
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,719
pin diet has a really low amplitude and

215
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,889
post-processing systems like years ago

216
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,160
DSP

217
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:56,480
can't handle that signal at all so like

218
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,850
to do it at home when you listen to

219
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,160
music and it's through to quiet or the

220
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,379
music isn't it loud enough you boost up

221
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,439
the amplifier and it's louder the same

222
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:10,189
is done in a receiver and in DeRosa we

223
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:12,858
place there an amplifier which boosts up

224
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:16,629
the amplitude coming out of the pindaya

225
00:09:12,859 --> 00:09:19,549
one side story here maybe when you have

226
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:21,889
in the field have the experience running

227
00:09:19,549 --> 00:09:25,239
a transceiver which is capable to 80

228
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:28,850
kilometres like an SP + s SP + set are

229
00:09:25,239 --> 00:09:31,160
they do have a really sensitive receiver

230
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,439
and some of you might have got that

231
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,929
experience when they connected a setup

232
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:38,358
from zero back to back with another true

233
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:41,660
80 kilometer transceiver without any

234
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:44,149
attenuation the link came up it stayed

235
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,059
there for five seconds and then it

236
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:48,410
dropped and it never came back up again

237
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:51,769
actually and then people say well you

238
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,689
have burned the receiver yes and know

239
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:55,489
what you actually have burned is the

240
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:57,980
amplifier and the amplifier destroyed

241
00:09:55,489 --> 00:10:00,139
himself because the on the input side

242
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,419
the amplifier got way too much current

243
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:05,119
because the light level was too high and

244
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:06,529
then it destroyed himself so if you have

245
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:08,419
the chance and you have to destroyed

246
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:10,489
your set out transceiver open up the

247
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:13,189
Roza replace the amplifier and it will

248
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:16,040
do its job again afterwards so that

249
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:22,610
that's the thing about burning the

250
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:25,309
receiver down okay so we covered now the

251
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:27,589
transmitter and the receiver section of

252
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:31,579
of the entire setup of a transceiver

253
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:34,160
when it comes to production like this

254
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:36,709
this could be a really long talk so I I

255
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,719
don't want to get too much into details

256
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:40,699
of the production but I think for

257
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,699
network engineers there isn't an

258
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:45,079
interesting thing to know is and I want

259
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:47,779
to point out on the production side on

260
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:50,149
the testing side when when we produce an

261
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:53,779
optical transceiver and especially about

262
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:55,369
the timing how much time does it take to

263
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,850
produce it and see if in order to test

264
00:10:55,369 --> 00:10:58,600
it

265
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:01,189
I took real figures out of production

266
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,679
and I explained the graph a little bit

267
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:04,980
so on the x-axis we do have the three

268
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,040
generations of 10k

269
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:11,399
104 Nike transceivers and on the y-axis

270
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,839
its timing in minutes we I do have a

271
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,970
free graph so the blue one is the

272
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,100
assembly the assembly of the old Walter

273
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:22,079
and seal itself to give you a rough idea

274
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:23,760
a 10 gigabit transceiver to a sample m2

275
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,229
test in combination is roughly eight

276
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,600
minutes yes for sure we do this in

277
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,790
batches also later on at the testing but

278
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,680
it's roughly eight minutes now the green

279
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,449
line and that's the interesting one

280
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,949
which has a really steep raise up a

281
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:41,250
steep rise up here is the testing and

282
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:43,170
the testing and and the orange one is

283
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:46,290
the combination of both of them or the

284
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:48,209
overall time so what we see here the ten

285
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,130
gigabit assembly and testing as I said

286
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:52,439
roughly eight minute but when it comes

287
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,839
to 400 gigabit we are talking about

288
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,480
assembly of roughly 25 minutes to build

289
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,440
the entire Tulsa Rose assembly to a PCB

290
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:03,420
and and then it's and mounded but when

291
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,810
you want to test the whole piece this

292
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:10,050
takes a roughly 90 minutes so this is a

293
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:12,569
major difference now you can imagine if

294
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,969
you wanna if you are in production Lyman

295
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:16,769
and you wanted wanna save costs you

296
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:19,829
don't do this on assembly you do this on

297
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:22,860
testing because also in testing there's

298
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:25,949
a very expensive equipment involved to

299
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,930
produce to test the transceiver and also

300
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:30,420
when you occupy that the equipment for a

301
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:32,790
long time like those 90 minutes here you

302
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,430
can do the math you can't do that many

303
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:38,699
of transceivers add a way while you're

304
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,589
occupying your equipment and there are

305
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:42,810
actually two ways to handle that there's

306
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:44,970
a bad way just to get rid of test cases

307
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,819
and for sure when you get a bit of test

308
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:50,519
cases then you get down the old wall

309
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:52,769
testing type or and that's something up

310
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,690
or what we also see in the DevOps and

311
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:57,300
Lam and the network engineering you do

312
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,250
automated tests and the same happens in

313
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,829
the optical engineering environment as

314
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,589
well so when you automate your test

315
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:06,029
cases you get down the overall timing at

316
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:09,149
the end of the day and that's where you

317
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:11,970
save time on testing and time on the

318
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:14,850
production this really matters to give

319
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,829
you an idea about a test case I took the

320
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:20,680
example of temperature tests

321
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:25,989
so here I do have the temperature test

322
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:28,719
or at oil at zero degrees centigrade and

323
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:31,509
also on 70 degrees centigrade and we see

324
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,310
while the green laser here when we

325
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:35,889
change the temperature it's gonna be

326
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:39,579
drifting away a little bit but at a

327
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:44,699
certain time it will stabilize we could

328
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:48,128
say well okay it passed the test and but

329
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:50,680
if we if you take the second constraint

330
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:53,050
into their test which is the time and we

331
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,449
say for example okay we start at zero

332
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:57,670
degree centigrade keep the laser there

333
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:59,620
for not longer than 10 seconds and

334
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,479
within 10 seconds it needs to be

335
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,000
stabilized and then boost up the

336
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,699
temperature to 70 degrees within 60

337
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,269
seconds and again if the transmitter for

338
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:14,109
example to give to stabilize the laser

339
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:19,600
within 10 seconds the same part might

340
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:21,550
fail because the green laser it took way

341
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,519
longer to get stabilized and there might

342
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,170
be something broken inside or maybe not

343
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:27,939
working properly and this might end up

344
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,459
in the field later in the faulty part

345
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:33,310
and so there you can see how you define

346
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:36,130
the test cases you get either you get a

347
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:39,399
either a pass or later on you get a fail

348
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:44,889
so the definition of the test case

349
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:46,060
really matters here so we so at the

350
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:48,040
overall goal for sure's

351
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,810
coming out of production is getting the

352
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:54,160
green traffic like saying well okay we

353
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:57,939
get a proper tested part so far we

354
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,149
covered now the overall transceiver the

355
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:03,490
transmitter section receiver section and

356
00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:05,800
as at the beginning I said there is this

357
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,990
new introduced digital signal processor

358
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,120
for phone a gigabit transceivers and I

359
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:13,420
want to point out one certain function

360
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,399
of the DSP generally it has two

361
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,199
functions the one is taking care about

362
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,600
the encoding typically it's pam-4

363
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,508
encoding but that's something I don't

364
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,750
want to cover now and secondly it's the

365
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:27,339
forward error correction what is what is

366
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,110
the forward error correction and maybe

367
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:29,889
if we do a little bit looking back in

368
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,759
history

369
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:35,350
we already know error detection when you

370
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,170
look in your Ethernet frame you have to

371
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:40,209
one thousand one one thousand five from

372
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:43,628
the bytes the frame at the end you have

373
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:44,229
to cycling redundancy check sum of four

374
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:46,779
bytes

375
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,609
this is actually error detection so with

376
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,850
those few four bytes you can detect an

377
00:15:48,609 --> 00:15:54,040
error but you can't correct it now with

378
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:57,339
higher speeds there is the demand also

379
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,959
yes there are errors and it is not

380
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:01,449
sufficient any longer just to detect

381
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,559
them we also need to correct them and

382
00:16:01,449 --> 00:16:05,669
that's where the for error correction

383
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,199
takes place and it's done in the DSP a

384
00:16:05,669 --> 00:16:10,089
little bit of recap on Hana gigabit

385
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:12,189
forward error correction was first

386
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:13,509
introduced in one on a gigabit but not

387
00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:14,980
on the transceiver side it was

388
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:18,100
introduced in the switching and routing

389
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:21,429
side and so basically how does it work

390
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:25,419
we have a fake encoder on the switch and

391
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:26,980
it encodes the in our stream brings it

392
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:29,230
on the line by add a transceiver and

393
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,639
then on the other side is a decoder how

394
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,369
does this in principle work

395
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,980
I took an artificial example here with a

396
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:39,309
lorry and and a truck to explain a

397
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:43,679
little bit on the first step the lorry

398
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:47,019
is our fake encoder and the pricks on on

399
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:49,779
on the lorry itself this is our payload

400
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:51,610
and then when the lorry hits the dot G

401
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:53,499
Road which is our fiber all the pricks

402
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,809
inside there gets somehow disordered

403
00:16:53,499 --> 00:16:57,939
even one prick is falling off actually

404
00:16:55,809 --> 00:17:01,389
this doesn't happen in do in the optical

405
00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:03,399
environment but and then this third step

406
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:06,189
the accelerator this is our effect

407
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:09,339
decoder so what does the excavator does

408
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:11,500
it brings all the bricks on the on the

409
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:14,470
lorry back in order that the post

410
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,179
processing workers can do something with

411
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,970
those bricks and that's the same happens

412
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:20,589
with the effecti coder there now you can

413
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,000
imagine that this excavator takes a

414
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,888
little bit time to get all the bricks

415
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,138
back in water and sort them and also

416
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:29,139
effect Nick needs time to operate

417
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:31,029
soin told you get an additional delay of

418
00:17:29,139 --> 00:17:33,129
around 100 nanoseconds on your Hana

419
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:35,289
Gigabit link when you enable to effect

420
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,779
there that's something to bear in mind

421
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:40,570
so the you need to give to the effect a

422
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:42,399
little bit time to operate how does it

423
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,590
how we're looking for in a gigabit it

424
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:46,320
will get way more calm

425
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:48,600
Lex instead of having only the fake on

426
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,850
the switch inside like here and the

427
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,649
decoder here we also have fake involved

428
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,529
on the transceiver itself inside of the

429
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:57,960
DSP so first of all the fact I called

430
00:17:55,529 --> 00:18:00,659
the T Effect 2 encodes the signal and

431
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,419
then the transceiver effect will decode

432
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:05,820
it then the transceiver fake again

433
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,950
encodes it brings it on the fiber itself

434
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,189
and on the other side it happens to vice

435
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:13,080
versa so defect 1 decodes in fact 2

436
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,960
encodes it brings it over to the Effect

437
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,639
2 decoder and then post processing

438
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,260
systems like the Asics and so on

439
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:24,090
takeover of this of the payload and for

440
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,100
and there are pretty much two two

441
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:29,959
findings where I think it's important to

442
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:32,428
mention the first one is about the fake

443
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,440
you might have discovered issues on a

444
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:36,480
Hana gigabit link which you when you

445
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,640
establish the link and you have bit

446
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,770
errors on your line so the first thing

447
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,289
you need to double-check is the fake

448
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,820
enable or disable because depending on

449
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,210
the type of application you're running

450
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,428
there

451
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,830
it's either intended to be enabled by

452
00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:52,649
default or disabled effect so an example

453
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,750
is like a hundred gigabit SR for doing

454
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:57,178
multimode transmission up to a hundred

455
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,010
fifty meters the effect needs to be

456
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:01,890
enabled by default just on the fact that

457
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:05,760
it's multi mode and the SR for

458
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:08,070
technology there so typically the switch

459
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,750
operating system when it gets the

460
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:13,830
transceiver plugged in it recognized it

461
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:15,390
will enable the the defect but in some

462
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,418
circumstance it can happen that it

463
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:21,360
doesn't enable it so you better check if

464
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:25,140
the fake is enabled on both ends if

465
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,600
you're seeing bit errors the second one

466
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,510
is you might also have experience ok the

467
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,250
link doesn't come up at all and then you

468
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:35,070
also need to check on both sides

469
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:37,649
actually is the fact enable because we

470
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,779
have seen scenarios that the the left

471
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:41,760
switch for example enable to fake and

472
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,990
the right switch didn't do it because it

473
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,970
was a different window different

474
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,409
operating system and the different

475
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:48,149
implementation at the end of the day so

476
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:50,100
it didn't automatically enable or

477
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:53,699
disable it so there wasn't equal and

478
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:55,350
unequal amount effects involved and for

479
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,340
sure when when you have an unequal

480
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,678
amount effects

481
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,840
won't work at all so you always need to

482
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,789
make sure that you have the same amount

483
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,490
of Xing wolf and in four and a gigabit

484
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:08,520
it's not only cereal not only - it can

485
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:11,100
also be four so you need to make really

486
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,889
show which fact is involved which is

487
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,168
enabled the transceiver one or the one

488
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:19,440
on the switch and this and this on both

489
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:21,029
sides that's the tricky part here let's

490
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,740
see how the operating systems of the

491
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:24,210
switches will handle of this in the

492
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,010
future so that you can differentiate

493
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:32,210
which fact is enabling which is disabled

494
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:35,460
this brings me up to the small summary

495
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:39,330
also a small out view what will happen

496
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:41,940
in 2020 in the optical optical

497
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:48,299
networking for sure for on a gigabit is

498
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:52,820
a hot topic but like people expect like

499
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:55,770
lr4 it's not standardized yet there are

500
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,720
still ongoing discussions if it will be

501
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:00,510
from the wavelength good if it will be

502
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:06,179
CWDM for which has a spacing of each

503
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:09,510
laser of 20 nanometers or this is gonna

504
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:11,370
be the LAN WDM spacing with 5 nanometer

505
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,830
which we know from one and a gigabit lr

506
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,539
4 which is standardized for a while but

507
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:17,820
for the Forna gigabit this is still not

508
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:22,200
defined yet there are different tensions

509
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:24,210
in industry to push to CW them for

510
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,080
because if you have a broader spectrum

511
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:30,690
it's way cheaper to produce but also

512
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,029
there are advantages if you go to the

513
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,740
LAN table medium so we will see the 2020

514
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:37,620
where standardization especially I

515
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,590
Triple E will make their decision and

516
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:43,260
also from the real lr4 application like

517
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:45,149
doing single mode transmission up to 10

518
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,490
kilometers which we are used or which we

519
00:21:45,149 --> 00:21:50,039
know from Hana gigabit or even 40 or 10

520
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:52,399
gigabit doesn't matter there are ideas

521
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:55,950
to go down to 6 kilometers and so on

522
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:58,649
let's see what will happen in 2020 s and

523
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:01,770
the second one is I didn't expect it

524
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:04,918
actually to be honest is I thought the

525
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:06,570
train for one a gigabit is over no one

526
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,399
is spending any money on the development

527
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,439
of one on a gigabit but we have seen

528
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:12,409
latest development

529
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,260
in 2019 and also ready products on a

530
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:17,780
real er for doing real 40 kilometres

531
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:20,540
transmission on a single pair of fiber

532
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:22,220
and or even like a set up for doing 80

533
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:24,050
kilometres with the HANA gigabit

534
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,570
transceiver and I'm talking here about

535
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:29,450
the interesting form factors like USP 28

536
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:32,770
and not taking the CFP X family in

537
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:37,160
consideration here and the third one is

538
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:40,629
for gigabit dr4 it's mainly the dr4 is a

539
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:43,910
data center application up to 500 meters

540
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:46,340
the speciality what I think which which

541
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,910
will come out this year this with PSM

542
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:52,909
block what is so special about DSM Clark

543
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:55,400
quite a few know since the introduction

544
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:58,220
of 40 gigabit transceivers the MPO block

545
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,560
or empty people block from us connect it

546
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,840
was this multi push multi-fiber push

547
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,370
unplucked with eight or twelve fibers in

548
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,340
one plug which you plugged in and out

549
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,050
which is technology wise a great block

550
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:13,730
but maintenance wise

551
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:15,950
horrible the problem with this typical

552
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,660
breakout notice you you have those eight

553
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,430
fibers online next to each other

554
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,780
combined in one house and you plug it

555
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,210
into the transceiver and then you can do

556
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:25,850
this fan-out node 2 4 times 10 gigabit

557
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:28,670
or 4 times 25 gigabit which is great if

558
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,320
you want to maintain one single link you

559
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:33,110
have to unblock the entire block so all

560
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,370
the other three links will drop the TSM

561
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:36,979
plug this issue

562
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:38,810
this is issues solve so the sm plug

563
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,910
itself is a single block withholding to

564
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:43,429
fuels in combination with its

565
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:45,890
counterparts it's gonna be a cluster so

566
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:48,910
it's a block of four plugs combined into

567
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:51,860
into the receptacle of a traffic Yousefi

568
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:53,930
dr4 and if you want to maintain a single

569
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,270
link you can just release two to four

570
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:58,790
rules and the other six rules will stay

571
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:00,050
in the transceiver why is this so

572
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,960
important or why is it so interesting

573
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:05,030
with for nicking a bit it's not only a

574
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,590
pure 400 gigabit transceiver

575
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,870
you can also see matching of

576
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,090
applications doing out of a phone and

577
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:13,669
gigabit transceiver driving four times a

578
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,590
hundred gigabit you could either do for

579
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,360
example full mesh so you have for

580
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,580
example three routers each of them is

581
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,209
holding a single phone a gigabit

582
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,100
transceiver

583
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,640
so you could connect from router eight

584
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,199
to be

585
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,730
with the Hahnel Giga bit with one

586
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,830
transceiver and then from the same

587
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,720
transceiver you could do 200 Giga bit in

588
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,490
two times the Hana gigabit to router C

589
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,110
and then from router see throughout

590
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,990
órale you could do one on a gigabit

591
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:38,000
again and you only let let's say there

592
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:41,420
are only three transceivers involved so

593
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,070
you can do a really nice mesh just due

594
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:48,760
to the fact that you have the receptacle

595
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:51,290
of the SM plug there coming from the dr4

596
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,679
also new things happening on one on the

597
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:56,928
gigabit LR and why do I mention one on

598
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:58,850
gigabit LR here this is the section when

599
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:02,030
it comes to single lambda transceivers

600
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:05,418
so there will be new one on a gigabit

601
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:07,850
transceivers coming out but this is not

602
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:10,760
an LR for which we are used to use in

603
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:13,659
these days now this is an LR 1 so it has

604
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:16,850
one lambda out of the Q's of P 28

605
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:19,940
driving a hundred gigabit and when you

606
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:22,399
look back to the four on a gig dr for

607
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:25,429
this is the perfect counterpart to

608
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,559
connect either a a 400 gigabit dr four

609
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:29,990
to a phone a big hiccup idea for for

610
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:31,399
sure or doing the breakout mode in terms

611
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:33,799
of four times a hundred

612
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,830
giga a bit and then if you have the

613
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:39,440
counterparty interface there is a one on

614
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:43,730
the gigabit lr connecting to a dr 4 for

615
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,730
example this would be doable in when we

616
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:51,230
go to the lower speeds but also the DWDM

617
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:53,120
great 40 gig and 25 DWDM is available

618
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,910
straight out of the transceivers up to a

619
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,449
power budget of 11 DB so no external

620
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:01,640
amplification is needed there I'm really

621
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:05,169
only focusing on the pluggable itself

622
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:08,000
without any external amplification etc

623
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:10,480
this to summarize it brings me almost to

624
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,650
the end of my presentation for us itself

625
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,990
especially the DSP and the foanna

626
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:17,390
gigabit transceivers will give a new

627
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,010
challenge also when it comes to the

628
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,080
implementation of the Flex box how we

629
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:23,059
change the behavior of transceiver

630
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,980
so far we are familiar with the

631
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:27,168
microcontroller inside of a transceiver

632
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,940
and now with the phone Gigabit this will

633
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:31,190
be a little bit game-changing because

634
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,480
also the DSP is running a firmware

635
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:37,830
running a configuration and

636
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:39,179
we tweet and optimized yeah

637
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,490
brings me to the end if there are

638
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:44,750
questions I'm happy to take them thank

639
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,750
you very much for listening

640
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:57,540
hello question when you mention that

641
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,690
there's like almost 4 different facts

642
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:03,149
running on a link how much say latency

643
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:05,820
increased with those Beck working do you

644
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:08,460
know yeah so it will double so you will

645
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:12,510
be roughly at 200 nanoseconds if you

646
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:14,580
have both fix at each side involved yeah

647
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:17,490
switch effect transceiver fake on left

648
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,290
side and switch fake entrance even fake

649
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:22,830
on the right side so that would be like

650
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:23,970
200 yeah yeah yeah it will depend also

651
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,740
on the implement so the hundred

652
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,380
nanoseconds it's a rule of thumb roughly

653
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,850
it depends on the type of fake there are

654
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,740
different type of facts out there also

655
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:34,080
propriety ones and which are then

656
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,390
standardized ones from dry Tripoli but

657
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,340
it's roughly around 100 nanoseconds they

658
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:40,200
can be some of them doing only 70

659
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:50,809
nanoseconds but it's roughly in that

660
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:55,470
range ok hey yours laughing yes sorry

661
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:58,080
works a question about testing you

662
00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:01,080
mentioned that testing times have been

663
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:05,309
going up exponentially Tenakee gate was

664
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:08,790
3 minutes 180 30 minutes and now 400 key

665
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:12,690
90 minutes is it just because 40 key

666
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:14,668
sorry 400 key key key key is the latest

667
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:18,090
technology that testing time is so high

668
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:19,950
are you expecting that to call down from

669
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:22,290
the current 90 minutes to something like

670
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:25,020
30 minutes or even less than 10 minutes

671
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:29,460
in the future that's a really good

672
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:32,100
question and really hard to answer from

673
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,960
the testing point of testing equipment I

674
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,209
wouldn't see it getting down because the

675
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:40,200
equipment is yes it's expensive but it's

676
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:41,520
still capable to handle it the problem

677
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,960
at 4 and a gigabit is mainly the

678
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:51,529
temperature so you you need to give the

679
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:55,679
little bit time anyway plus I think

680
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:58,649
automation can bring the timing down in

681
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:01,830
terms when you yeah that's what I think

682
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:04,489
but it's difficult to answer oh sorry

683
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,490
thank you

684
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:13,399
