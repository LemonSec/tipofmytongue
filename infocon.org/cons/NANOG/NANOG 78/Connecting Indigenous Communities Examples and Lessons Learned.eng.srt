1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
good morning sweetie pleasure and

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,180
privilege to be here speaking to a

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,830
community of expert said such of

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,190
yourselves and thank you for sticking

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,160
before lunch and enjoying this last half

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,320
an hour before the meal is served she

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,539
would like to thank the Nanog program

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,050
committee for viewing accepting this

9
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,490
this presentation I left my name is

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,070
samba drawn and picked co technical

11
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,439
advisor with the intersociety business

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:32,399
Ottawa Canada before I used to work for

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,410
Cisco left as a single architect being

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,110
based in Ottawa two days when I left was

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,849
minus 27 degrees Celsius so it's a very

16
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:43,489
positive change to come here and see the

17
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:46,710
Sun with some warmth actually shining

18
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:48,780
the point of connecting digital

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,190
communities in North America is

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,879
something that really the intersociety

21
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:57,599
occurs about a lot and we will preview

22
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,030
here some deployments that we have done

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,760
over the last year and we are embarking

24
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,799
on as we speak as well as some key

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:11,009
lessons learned from these engagements

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,560
we will talk the status of connectivity

27
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:17,850
particularly in the Canadian north last

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:20,400
talks in nano Austin might our partner

29
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,640
matter antenna and spoke in detail about

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,159
connecting tribal lands in the US so

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,290
this my talk will complement this this

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,329
point but looking further into the

33
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,070
Canadian Canadian North challenges but

34
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,470
giving examples from both Canada and the

35
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,839
US so the file of community networks are

36
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,700
we look at examples as I mentioned and

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,040
look at issues that relate to capacity

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,570
building challenges opportunities as

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,220
well as three point of lessons learnt

40
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:50,789
for a start maybe a few words about

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,979
Indian society maybe some of you know

42
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,170
what do it but just as a refresher we

43
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,539
were founded in back in 1992 by the

44
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,950
founders of the internet within five

45
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,020
years we are global nonprofit

46
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,740
organization dedicated to ensuring an

47
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,439
open accessible resilient

48
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,750
internet for the use by by everybody the

49
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:13,140
authority is based on we have a network

50
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,650
of about sixty four thousand members 130

51
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,720
chapters

52
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:19,290
worldwide and special interest groups

53
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,079
one on for example connected digital

54
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,120
networks or community networks as well

55
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:27,269
as we have more than 100 organization

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,650
members we work a lot to our chapters so

57
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:31,470
it's really a bottom up can kind of

58
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,609
approach collaborate on broad topics

59
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,200
from the technology policy issues

60
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:39,450
technologies particular that keep

61
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,879
internet safe and secure and resilient

62
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,619
and we serve as the organization home

63
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,370
for the IETF internet Engineering Task

64
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:52,560
Force if you look at the connectivity

65
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:55,260
status in the Canadian north basically

66
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,139
we have particularly in the eastern

67
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,358
eastern part of the Canadian Canadian

68
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:01,170
north northwest territories looook

69
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:04,409
territory

70
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,768
we have majority of the connector of the

71
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:10,108
communities our satellite dependent more

72
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:13,379
than 42 communities have been counted by

73
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:15,810
by I said the ministry of innovation

74
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:20,489
science economic develop of canada in

75
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,410
one of the last census the communities

76
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,930
are these particulates are completely

77
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,639
dependent a very small number have

78
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,519
access to other backward technologies

79
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,440
microwave or or fiber inside satellite

80
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,400
and these communities is quite expensive

81
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,010
to say the least

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,440
and four core worth a fortune he quite

83
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,760
unreliable any one example one of the

84
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,260
communities that we are going to talk

85
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,319
about more detail when you have tech

86
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,000
although the the Inuit although the

87
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,260
nominal speed should be around five

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,540
megabits per second for the whole

89
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,000
community but they see is we typically

90
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,340
load on one megabit per second for the

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,019
whole community challenge another

92
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,540
challenge is small number of riders no

93
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,430
competition really and there's no

94
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,620
appetite to invest in that part of the

95
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,579
of Canada because the return on

96
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:08,489
investment is small in small population

97
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:11,579
remoteness and difficult train make it

98
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:15,090
make the appetite for operators go there

99
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:17,099
invest quite quite lacking and this is a

100
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,680
map of the eastern part of the Canadian

101
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:27,029
north and we see here the communities

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:27,660
are satellite satellite reliant and most

103
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:30,570
of them are

104
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,090
have really bad bad connectivity in

105
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,800
terms of broadband so this is really

106
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,929
something that impacts the communities

107
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,730
in that part of of Canada

108
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,070
deeply in terms of economic development

109
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:43,200
education and development delivering

110
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,540
health services all these I'll debit

111
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,729
definitely negatively impacted by lack

112
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:53,550
of adequate broadband services to these

113
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:55,350
communities the government has started

114
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,290
some some initiatives in trying to bring

115
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:00,840
broadband connectivity to the north by

116
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:04,590
committee to invest to two billion

117
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,830
dollars next five years in terms of

118
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:10,710
infrastructure in terms of Universal

119
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,169
broadband fund in terms of running a

120
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,880
census a c6 and a-- to find out the

121
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,560
details of what exactly are the

122
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,870
communities suffering from in terms of

123
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,150
broadband connectivity unfortunately

124
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,190
this is very good but it takes time to

125
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:25,469
deploy another project but

126
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:29,490
infrastructure Canada Bank back in from

127
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:31,530
Canada will link a fiber cable from

128
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,560
Greenland to the Canadian north from

129
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:38,400
gradient which is far sorry which is far

130
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,290
east to to the Canadian north here this

131
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,479
will take at least five years to deploy

132
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:45,960
and its cost because has not started yet

133
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,210
is increasing from 114 million now it's

134
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,099
200 retracted and if it doesn't start

135
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,780
would even increase more before it even

136
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:56,580
starts

137
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:58,140
so the situation is quite difficult the

138
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,690
approach here is to build a network

139
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,210
allow the community itself to build

140
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,610
connectivity for its own use and its own

141
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:08,549
benefits and try to harness the benefit

142
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,590
of having a broadband connection for a

143
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,190
dimension educational services health

144
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:15,869
services and economic prosperity the

145
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,540
foundation concept of which networks is

146
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,140
it to do it to a self kind of solution

147
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:24,120
the community members themselves bring

148
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:26,760
rally along each other and the build

149
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,490
their network by themselves learning the

150
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,409
technology and getting the hardware and

151
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:34,050
building the network from bottom up

152
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,120
buying by themselves in many cases by

153
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,400
from accept by external support experts

154
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,159
or from funding by external sources such

155
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,758
as such as the AIESEC

156
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:46,679
in society this kind of approach is

157
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,509
completely community dependent the

158
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:50,698
community has to rally behind this cause

159
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:52,259
and make it one of itself its priorities

160
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:52,559
to build the network and see it up and

161
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,989
running

162
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:56,669
not only that but keeping it up and

163
00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:59,339
running in the future and grouping for

164
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:01,859
models for sustainability of funding of

165
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:03,899
this kind of project it's a huge effort

166
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,279
to be led by the community to be built

167
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:08,999
by the community operated by the

168
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:13,229
community but relying on larger sphere

169
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:15,029
of supporters technical funding side

170
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:16,498
regulatory side to help these

171
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:19,349
communities flourish and grow and be

172
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:22,860
sustainable and humid networks are

173
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:25,080
really complementary to network provide

174
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,119
it for commercial use by by operators or

175
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:33,119
by others they don't replace the

176
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:34,769
component in the words of one of the

177
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:38,009
inhabitants of all who have tech and

178
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:40,379
opinion north as you will see she says

179
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:42,360
with networks creating money in the

180
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:44,550
within the community by operating our

181
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,889
own network and create training and

182
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,139
employment opportunities for residents

183
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:52,229
she has to pay more than $250 a month

184
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:53,909
for simple connectivity for simple voice

185
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:56,159
connectivity which is really something

186
00:07:53,909 --> 00:08:01,050
that is quite quite a burden on this

187
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:03,990
type of communities what we want to

188
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:07,229
examples we have an example in Hawaii an

189
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,159
example in the Canadian north if you

190
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:09,508
think about Hawaii

191
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:11,938
you think video about why Tiki Beach

192
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:14,729
think about the commercial strip think

193
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:19,679
about the view the beautiful landscape

194
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:21,990
food beautiful scenery 45 minutes drive

195
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:22,919
on the other side of the island lies

196
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,079
this community

197
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:30,209
Punahou no Omaha no the sanctuary over

198
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:31,679
monado is basically a community what

199
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:34,948
they call themselves station of Hawaii

200
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:38,250
and base about thirty or forty thirteen

201
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:41,218
homes on the side of the mountain and

202
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:43,799
they really lack fundamental technology

203
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:48,089
they have they have voice white screen

204
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:50,189
activity over 4G network but in terms of

205
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:53,430
broadband to the to the houses this is

206
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:54,660
completely lack in the words of one one

207
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,910
of the

208
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,910
inhabitants he has to run to the hope to

209
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:02,360
the house of the chief and still the USB

210
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:05,430
USB LTE dongle

211
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,220
use it for his home was was doing his

212
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,079
homework when the chief is away and by 1

213
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,660
or 2 P a.m. in the morning before the

214
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:13,920
chief returns back he runs to his house

215
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,490
and puts it puts it where it's supposed

216
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,160
to be the other story is that it's a

217
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,680
habit that the children school-age

218
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,019
children have to be put in a van for and

219
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,029
put to Starbucks for four hours to do

220
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:31,500
their homework that's the only way they

221
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:35,339
have access to the Internet this kind of

222
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:38,389
community really became a pioneer in

223
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:41,029
asking and running behind implementing

224
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:46,800
Community Network projects in there

225
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:50,160
under under land the solution that that

226
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:55,079
we have opted in opted for along with

227
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:57,629
our partners is basically an LTE

228
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:01,589
unlicensed licensed spectrum credit kind

229
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:03,089
of network at five gigahertz and what

230
00:10:01,589 --> 00:10:06,350
was sufficient for this size of the

231
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:10,740
metro to deploy it will no not bees and

232
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:12,209
in this here in this location it will be

233
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,750
facing this direction and this direction

234
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:18,209
and then having CPS outdoor cities on a

235
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,149
number of homes that have typically

236
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:22,979
children at at least these homes and

237
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:25,290
that inside the house a spiritual city

238
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,470
is you have to have Wi-Fi routers to

239
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:31,800
have larger larger coverage of of signal

240
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:36,720
signal coverage this community has been

241
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:39,300
quite quite lucky there was fiber

242
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,380
termination just outside the offence of

243
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,269
of the of the village from from the

244
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:48,089
local operator so the community really

245
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:50,399
had to dig a trench for where the

246
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:52,559
junction box is to install their own

247
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,649
land to where the node B termination

248
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:57,689
will come and they did it on our

249
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:59,579
voluntary basis of the inferno on their

250
00:10:57,689 --> 00:11:02,370
own land they themselves did it by the

251
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:05,370
own what the equipment and did this kind

252
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:08,279
of of termination

253
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,260
and the cost has been has been lowered

254
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,760
by the by the operator - about four

255
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,880
hundred dollars per month for cooking

256
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,700
meat per second capacity this is the

257
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,770
picture of the note in obese and the DCT

258
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:24,570
is on on the only houses these are lists

259
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:27,630
list of partners that were engaged and

260
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:33,000
this is this approach and we see here

261
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:35,460
nanog listed and Edward Edward was kind

262
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,680
enough to participate in this effort and

263
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:41,010
show support nano support to make it to

264
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,300
make it successful the second example is

265
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,089
the Alou habitat and northern Canada

266
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:49,979
although habitat is here at 71 degrees

267
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:54,570
north rosante north and it's a very

268
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:57,360
small community of 350 inhabitants that

269
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:59,810
really supplied dependent one megabits

270
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:04,470
per second is really what they see on a

271
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:07,109
daily basis we are planning to deploy a

272
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,730
new solution in this network as well

273
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:12,990
based on the partnerships that we have

274
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:14,430
with particular provider the the how it

275
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,620
came about through discussions in the

276
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:19,620
digital entities summit which is summit

277
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,350
that the intersociety got implements on

278
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,279
a yearly basis bringing community net

279
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,010
communities indigenous communities from

280
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,050
across Canada and the US together talk

281
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,430
about the challenges and the examples

282
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,620
and things that we can do together

283
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:34,170
bringing in also government government

284
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,779
officials and academia and other other

285
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:40,020
experts so they short support in 2000 in

286
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:41,550
summer 2019 identified either leaders

287
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,339
who want to make this happen within the

288
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:46,920
community and we began the training for

289
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:51,660
both old hog-tied and Hawaii in the

290
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:54,630
summer of 2019 for three three months by

291
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,880
December were ready to deploy the

292
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,730
network in in Hawaii you will have tech

293
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,339
network is still not in the deployment

294
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,440
phase mostly because of logistics of

295
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:06,720
shipping the gear through the Canadian

296
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,160
North is really very weather dependent

297
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,650
and you have twins if you wait for the

298
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,350
spring batricia to ship any antenna or

299
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:17,130
any termination points that that far

300
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:19,410
north the another challenge in India

301
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,750
with this kind of network is the

302
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:24,900
the cost of the satellite termination

303
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:27,840
and as we will see that we all want this

304
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,939
to be really from juice station

305
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,340
satellite moving to low Earth orbit

306
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:37,140
satellites to use that are coming at the

307
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:39,150
end of 2020 or to a 21 and this makes

308
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,160
the solution quite expensive this is

309
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:45,300
another obstacle for deploying networks

310
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:48,510
in such such a territory we had

311
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,800
significant training done and this is

312
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,830
very important for the community to

313
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,599
grasp the skills the technical skills as

314
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,670
well as assistive soft skills types of

315
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,250
business acumen financial planning

316
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,319
project management how to access funding

317
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,730
how to request funding and of course the

318
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:09,000
technical skills how to build a network

319
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:10,830
and operate the network not a finite

320
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,810
final part of this train that delivered

321
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:15,480
either face-to-face or mostly in the

322
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,939
preparatory phase online through about

323
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,470
16 online sessions done by community

324
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,040
members that have run through this this

325
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:25,140
in the under only our communities an

326
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,469
important aspect is the local hands on

327
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:30,150
training the handler training is really

328
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,370
for the community so you see here and

329
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,689
these pictures the ladies within the

330
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,490
community were the ones that really at

331
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,470
the forefront wanted to learn how to

332
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,170
terminate the ethernet cable how to plug

333
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:43,770
in to the CTE how the configuration of

334
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:46,620
the load EB is it is done and this

335
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:49,230
picture shows the chief of the group in

336
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,610
committee in the woman a log teaching

337
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,220
his grandson how to terminate the

338
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:55,290
ethernet cable he asked him to stay out

339
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,480
of school stay at home with the fidelity

340
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,670
on Friday so that he sees this firsthand

341
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,320
he can teach him how this is done and

342
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,810
this is a way to make this project

343
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,570
successful community has to pitch in has

344
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:11,119
to learn themselves operate build and

345
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:13,590
operate the network financial services

346
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,500
sustainability is a key is a key point

347
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:18,300
that these two have this project up and

348
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,410
running for a long time and an

349
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:25,609
assessment successful fashion in terms

350
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,610
of Technology directions

351
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,720
this this section we'll talk about three

352
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:38,439
technology directions one of them as I

353
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:41,200
mentioned is the part of moving from do

354
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:44,650
station satellites that that are at the

355
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,990
height of 300 35,000 or 36,000

356
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:50,380
kilometers to some that is much lower at

357
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:54,520
1200 1500 kilometers from from earth and

358
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:55,930
then overcomes latency issue the to

359
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,180
weight agency of produce station

360
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:01,599
satellite as the order of half a second

361
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:04,300
for low orbit low-earth orbit satellite

362
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,120
oreos it should be in the tens tens of

363
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:10,240
milliseconds so this is really improves

364
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,250
a lot the latency the performance and

365
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,130
the promise of much higher bandwidth

366
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:18,100
availability then that for produce

367
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:21,010
additional satellites in this slide we

368
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,780
have two two operators that are focusing

369
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:26,189
in this space one web and and telesat

370
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:28,689
and they promote a fiber kind of

371
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,820
bandwidth hundreds of megabits per

372
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:33,370
second one of them talks about 1 1 or 2

373
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,920
gigabits per second that download

374
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,570
obscure upload capacity that is the

375
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,839
promise to be delivered but within

376
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:43,810
specific timeframe Telesat talks about

377
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:47,050
what 600 satellites by 2022

378
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,489
one web starts already a launch of 40

379
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:51,579
satellites few days ago that was

380
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:55,090
successful the promise is 360 satellites

381
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,340
by end of 22 I love this year moving to

382
00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:00,660
port 2000 satellites in the in the in

383
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:03,360
the future again the promise is fiber

384
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:07,569
virtual fiber kind of connectivity

385
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,819
capacity and resiliency at hopefully

386
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:11,649
with this kind of competition for

387
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,869
operators are in that that space that

388
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,880
prices will be more attractive for

389
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:18,010
communities that are we suffering for

390
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,970
lack of bandwidth in the northern Canada

391
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,970
or on tribal lands

392
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:29,590
of the backhaul as being the peach one

393
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,970
of the key challenges three to deploy a

394
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,280
community network particularly in remote

395
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,620
indigenous communities in turn Society

396
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,720
has put together a fact sheet that looks

397
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,479
into different options being Wireless or

398
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,300
being wireline options Wireless we have

399
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,260
a microwave we have satellite judiciary

400
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:49,570
we have left low-earth orbit satellites

401
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,520
we have Wi-Fi of course or TV white

402
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,740
spaces all these are technologies that

403
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,900
are being adopted for deployment of

404
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,640
backwall solutions on the wireline side

405
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,750
typically this fiber optical fiber

406
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,650
optics available it's most

407
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:04,330
cost-effective future-proof kind of

408
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,710
backhaul background solution but

409
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:08,320
unfortunately is not available

410
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:10,120
everywhere and so quad was really

411
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,919
cost-effective in places like the

412
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,780
Canadian north where distances are huge

413
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,780
and you have to align on some sort of

414
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:19,300
worlds capability this Factory is

415
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:25,420
available online and it can be accessed

416
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:28,000
through the URL that is here the the 20

417
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:31,960
that has been used in Romanello is an

418
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,970
LTE LTE architecture and this the choice

419
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,340
was was of the existing partnership of

420
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:39,220
the with the vendor that proposed to

421
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:41,320
deploy the the hardware for for free and

422
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,390
also which is very important to help

423
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,090
with the support and training of

424
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:48,670
community members and the online support

425
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:50,740
after after the plant this is very key

426
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,270
to make this project successful and we

427
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:56,050
were happy really that we have partnered

428
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:58,840
with them this kind of architecture you

429
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:01,629
have the end-user equipment which in our

430
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,810
case the outdoor CPE the radio access

431
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:06,640
network of course in our case selected

432
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:09,010
unlicensed spectrum at 50 Hertz and then

433
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,410
you have the evolving avoid packet core

434
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,879
in some cases it's hardware based or

435
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:15,190
this kind of solution or this kind of

436
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,370
vendor its software that lies lies in

437
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,540
the cloud it's cloud based solution one

438
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,810
element that is not shown on the slide

439
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:24,580
is the local gateway local gateway has

440
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:27,250
to be configured as part of the solution

441
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,960
its function is to split the data train

442
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,060
from the control plane data plane

443
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,610
remains within the local gateway the

444
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:36,520
control train goes to the cloud does all

445
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:38,530
the control and functions and comes back

446
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,600
again with any

447
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:44,620
from Asia needed so this is what has

448
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:47,610
been deployed and it's hard to say that

449
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,360
it's an elaborate solution in terms of

450
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,649
configuration effort that needs to

451
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,139
happen to deploy the solution

452
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,910
successfully of course you have to

453
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,820
register the end-users their interests

454
00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:00,100
through the sensor in the CPS and if one

455
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,580
of the Sims is not registered the right

456
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,830
way

457
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,480
connectivity does not happen so this is

458
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,800
a learning curve for poetry members

459
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,140
learn how this is done

460
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,060
and typically what we have seen in

461
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,010
within the community it helps a lot if

462
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,480
at least one or two people are Network

463
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,250
savvy have some PAC background or

464
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,500
networking and they can grasp the

465
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,600
elements of this kind of effort or this

466
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,890
kind of cooperation work easier than the

467
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,459
rest of the community which can help

468
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:29,200
with the other other types of

469
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:31,210
installation activities the third

470
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,890
component in the technology direction

471
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,510
has to do with spectrum and spectrum as

472
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:39,700
course you know it's really scarce

473
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:41,980
resource and in the u.s. the FCC has

474
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:45,630
embarked of making part of the spectrum

475
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,920
available it's the 2.5 gigahertz band

476
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,990
what's called education then the

477
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:53,200
spectrum usually was restricted to use

478
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:55,060
for schools and libraries for usage on

479
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,030
tribal dance that are recognized

480
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,620
recognized tribe indigenous tribes it

481
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:03,370
was allowed to use for other services

482
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:06,070
for internet connectivity or fixed

483
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:09,310
wireless services with with restrictions

484
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:11,740
the restriction is instructions are the

485
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:16,179
rate of deployment has to satisfy strict

486
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:17,830
metrics 50% of the of the area and then

487
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,720
the tribal land has to be covered or the

488
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:22,179
population has to be covered within 2

489
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,770
years within 5 years 80% of the

490
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,320
population on the tribal land has to be

491
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:29,379
covered so these are significant metrics

492
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,200
that the tribe tribal councils when they

493
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:34,330
apply for this spectrum has to really

494
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,460
plan for and make sure they can deliver

495
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,169
on this commitment the window

496
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,410
application for the tribal tribal

497
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:43,840
communities have have opened and the

498
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:46,390
beginning of rabri in February 3rd and 4

499
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,899
for 6 months the FCC is accepting

500
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:51,910
accepting applications from tribal

501
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,360
communities and this is very important

502
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,929
for

503
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:58,059
four tribes input in the US to apply for

504
00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:00,549
for this spectrum it's a really a scarce

505
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:02,590
resource and the FCC has made it

506
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:04,990
available after consultation with the

507
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:09,428
tribes would many entities including at

508
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:11,049
the ICS in Hawaii in last December and

509
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:13,120
made the window for six months to allow

510
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:18,429
for for this kind of input from tribal

511
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:20,739
communities what we see as challenges

512
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:22,120
and barriers of opportunities from this

513
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,299
from this work that we have done with

514
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,620
our partners of course in terms of

515
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:28,299
challenges to geography where these

516
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,219
communities lying the remoteness of

517
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:33,158
these communities bringing them bringing

518
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:35,169
not only hardware and and we have to

519
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:36,399
quit but also bringing people bringing

520
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:38,980
experts there to go to the Canadian

521
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:40,870
north from Toronto whatever cost you at

522
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:44,110
least eight thousand dollars for one

523
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:46,029
person and about two days each way so

524
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:48,459
that is challenge to to get into a

525
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:50,679
community the cost of the bring the

526
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,600
hardware and also of the operating costs

527
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:54,279
moving moving on as we seen from the

528
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,080
case of all new habitat we need at least

529
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:58,389
two hundred thousand dollars to maintain

530
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,949
connectivity at the capacity that weeks

531
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:03,760
make certain that make makes a

532
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:06,399
difference licensing a permits this is

533
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,980
an important the case of Hawaii if the

534
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:11,229
digging of the fiber was in not on the

535
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,809
land licensing and permits was really an

536
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:16,149
issue and that we have taken 66 months

537
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:18,490
to a year access to funding and access

538
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:20,320
to spectrum as we mentioned our he he

539
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,860
challenges that have to be overcome by

540
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,860
the community

541
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,820
although funding can can be content can

542
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:29,590
be available from from the government in

543
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,320
case of the Canadian government but the

544
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:35,379
funding criteria makes a significant

545
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,769
barrier for example to apply for for

546
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:42,700
funding from from I said you have to

547
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:44,980
have five years of other total budget

548
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,679
from from from the community which means

549
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,330
it's not available for start-up kind of

550
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,580
project or you have operational

551
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:53,439
experience for five years or and or

552
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,820
operation experience for five years

553
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,029
which is also something that is not

554
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,549
available in such such a permanent the

555
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:02,770
opportunities are really numerous

556
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:04,490
that a community support if it is there

557
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,170
it has really the

558
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:09,080
a grantee to make the project successful

559
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:11,170
and funding is available from different

560
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,129
sources including civil society

561
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,840
technology does not have to be

562
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,640
complicated there are solutions which we

563
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,439
can be can can be deployed without too

564
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,080
much knowledge which help with experts

565
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,940
around around the community other

566
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,220
technologies news and so on maker will

567
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:28,880
make backhaul solutions more available

568
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:31,130
and we have we have it has been done by

569
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,130
communities across the globe and there

570
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:37,010
are a small network of experts what we

571
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:39,590
call special interest groups that really

572
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:42,110
share experience share know-how and

573
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:45,050
share their knowledge how overcome

574
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:47,479
challenges together and this is a much

575
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:51,770
needed support for uprising communities

576
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:54,800
or new communities the lessons learned

577
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:56,690
are basically in two categories one on

578
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,580
the community side and one on the

579
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:01,429
technical side and the community side

580
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,860
it's absolutely necessary to find a

581
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:08,240
local local champion and local community

582
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:09,919
to rally behind the project and also you

583
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,230
should take time in preparing the

584
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,240
community members past building skill

585
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:16,429
development before the start of the

586
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,850
deformed this is really key they should

587
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:21,530
not be just observers to the network to

588
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,600
be deployed and operated they have do it

589
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:25,520
themselves so they have to learn and may

590
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,260
concern the hard hard way see the

591
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,650
network not upon running something is

592
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,450
wrong

593
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,160
this configuration they have to learn

594
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:34,340
how to do it themselves with the support

595
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,540
of the extended community technical

596
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,959
hands-on training and deployment the

597
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:40,550
community members is is key as well as

598
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,260
we're verifying the details of the

599
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,629
infrastructure and connectivity before

600
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:47,000
at the start of any deployment as we

601
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:49,670
have seen in case of Hawaii we had we

602
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,530
didn't really know before the in-depth

603
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:53,780
site survey was done that the junction

604
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:56,210
box was this distant away from the

605
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,550
community and we had to dig to crime to

606
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:01,070
bring the fiber inside so these fans

607
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,860
this kind of information has to come by

608
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,610
strong engagement with the community

609
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,409
multiple site surveys

610
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:08,990
lying on experts being there and

611
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,910
identifying the challenges and you have

612
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,610
to take your time I have to community

613
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,990
building is a time and effort consuming

614
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:17,370
activity but this is the only way to

615
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:20,320
success

616
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:22,840
what we would like to show now is really

617
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,149
a video of the woman I love deployment

618
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:34,240
that the intern Society has done a glass

619
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:36,520
a of the point this already changed my

620
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,110
life because I feel like I really can't

621
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,230
do it by myself

622
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:43,899
I mean I find because it really really

623
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:46,240
pops us and in this state it is really

624
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,750
hard to me to survive it really is hard

625
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,970
to survive so us having internet here we

626
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,830
don't have to leave this place we now

627
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:58,600
can make money from home we can do a

628
00:26:53,830 --> 00:27:01,679
business for me I mean it just means

629
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,679
freedom to us

630
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,440
and

631
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,219
[Music]

632
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,950
you

633
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:28,820
[Laughter]

634
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,179
so being independent you have to do your

635
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:38,800
own stuff you have to run your own power

636
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,360
you have to run your own water you have

637
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,340
to build your own roads and we've done

638
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,979
that over here for the last 25 years we

639
00:27:42,340 --> 00:28:00,040
built our own houses now we've built our

640
00:27:44,980 --> 00:28:02,890
own community broadband network our

641
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:06,340
internet service prior to this build was

642
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:08,950
very spotty at best we had cell service

643
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:12,070
there is one house that was getting

644
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:13,420
Internet off of this one pole here but

645
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,389
other than that everybody else's

646
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:18,310
Internet was really terrible

647
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:21,370
they had a dish service usually

648
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:22,350
satellite internet and in order for that

649
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:24,729
to work

650
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:26,350
other people had to not be on the

651
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,570
internet so you could only do one thing

652
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:31,959
at a time it's gonna be independence

653
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:34,060
what we live here for no I'm Anna we

654
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:38,020
strive for total independence from the

655
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:39,879
fixing of oil we've been under illegal

656
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:42,090
occupation of the military for the new

657
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,970
United States of America this allows us

658
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:49,290
to continue our stance of independence

659
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:51,350
on the web

660
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,350
you

661
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:05,470
personally for me it makes me feel like

662
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:08,560
I have allies all over the world I have

663
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:10,480
allies and in different sectors that we

664
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,480
can reach now because of our internet

665
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:31,300
and it'll make our job easier and it'll

666
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:35,220
make our nation's job easier my kids I

667
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:38,129
stopped offering and they were father

668
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,720
kids often times had to go down the road

669
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,210
debt to go to McDonald's they had to go

670
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,540
to Starbucks to finish uploading their

671
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:48,310
projects so and it was frustrating for a

672
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,740
lot of the parents because they had to

673
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:53,260
you know they had to kind of rearrange

674
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,180
their lives and just to just to keep

675
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,670
their kids from falling behind we

676
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,860
started to realize that the kids were

677
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:02,760
all online you were learning everything

678
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:06,669
online in school it made me realize that

679
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:09,790
without this technology without the

680
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:12,310
involvement in the digital world that

681
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:15,520
our kids were falling apart which would

682
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:17,980
mean that they would even have you know

683
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,129
hard hard time in their homes with their

684
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:23,239
parents

685
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,239
[Music]

686
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:32,740
already we have ideas in the works to

687
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:36,870
possibly create a library possibly

688
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:39,310
create on educational material and and

689
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:41,379
educational media so that we can

690
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:43,990
broadcast from from our village so that

691
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,610
our message gets outside of the village

692
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:48,760
and gets outside of a way and connects

693
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:50,770
to places all over the world we've been

694
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,900
really trying to advance ourselves

695
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:54,760
trying to get ourselves out there so

696
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,010
that we can be sustainable so that we

697
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,320
can be independent from from everything

698
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:01,780
else that stops us from moving forward

699
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:26,139
and this is just one more step in that

700
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:28,300
direction thank you all questions great

701
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:30,690
I think people are ready for lunch thank

702
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,690
you very much
