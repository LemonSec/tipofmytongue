1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,089
hey everyone how you doing today thanks

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,730
for coming and listening after lunch on

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,849
your own and and showing up to listen to

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:15,150
Damien and I talked a little bit about

5
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:17,880
the state of network automation my name

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,869
is Jonah Cowell I currently work for Ken

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,669
tech and the CTO but I have a pretty

8
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,619
wide experience as a practitioner

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,980
running infrastructure and operations

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,470
running networks I kind of shifted gears

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,440
and went into research for a few years

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,140
of Gartner and then moved back working

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,410
for a couple of vendors AppDynamics and

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,680
Cisco and currently attending today I'm

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,480
gonna talk a little bit about you know

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,160
the state of automation I'm gonna use a

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,739
little bit of the data that Damian

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,410
talked about but also sort of set some

19
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,599
guidelines and explain where I think

20
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,569
things are going and and some of the

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,320
things that we're seeing I've spoken to

22
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,069
a lot of folks trying to transform their

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,710
infrastructures transform their tooling

24
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:11,699
and most people really struggle with the

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:14,130
same problems which is really the people

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,470
and how they can deal with the debt that

27
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,399
they have as they try to transform and

28
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,979
build new things I obviously work for a

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,840
monitoring company I'm not going to talk

30
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,560
much about monitoring this is really

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,600
more about the automation side but we do

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,759
see things coming together so I'll talk

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,949
a little bit about what Damian touched

34
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,560
on which is that event-driven automation

35
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:42,409
and where we see things going especially

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:45,119
in some of our most advanced customers

37
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:47,520
so just going to touch on a few key

38
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,790
things around what's happening with the

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,590
network and the complexity and then talk

40
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,829
about the evolution of some of the

41
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,810
automation tools that we've seen because

42
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,880
there's been a lot of changes as the

43
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,360
infrastructures have have evolved so

44
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,789
have the tools and then also talk about

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,690
sort of State of the Union some of the

46
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,989
survey results and and sort of some of

47
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,780
the more advanced things around

48
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:17,070
integration and tucán

49
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,680
genuine systems and eventually

50
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,959
continuous delivery in sort of where

51
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,640
that's evolving to some of our customers

52
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,040
that can take are definitely on that

53
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,019
cutting edge but the bulk are trying to

54
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,690
figure out how they deal with their

55
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:35,640
current situation and sort of move on

56
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,350
some interesting information about

57
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,809
what's happening it's obviously good for

58
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,660
the audience here in terms of folks that

59
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,690
run networks or that run colocation and

60
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,070
other facilities enterprises are really

61
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,040
trying to get out of running their own

62
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,870
data centers they either want to go into

63
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,730
an environment where someone is running

64
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,810
it for them or there's additional

65
00:02:53,730 --> 00:03:00,239
flexibility and the graph over on the

66
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,090
right hand side really shows both

67
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,270
historical and future spending on cloud

68
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,160
services the top graph obviously it's

69
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,950
hard to see this but the top graph is

70
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,359
software as a service the other two

71
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,299
lines that are trending up our

72
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,400
infrastructure as a service and platform

73
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,260
as a service so those of you that are

74
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,350
doing colocation and building these

75
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,380
services are going to see continued

76
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,820
investment what this really means is

77
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,760
that the network becomes even more

78
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,519
important because as environments are

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,070
distributed and more SAS services are

80
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,660
being consumed the network becomes that

81
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,930
critical point that ties everything

82
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,670
together which is good news for us as an

83
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,550
industry because the problems are just

84
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:47,070
going to get more complex and the demand

85
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:51,930
on our services and what we build is

86
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:54,959
going to increase but the complexity is

87
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,080
also increasing significantly we heard a

88
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,610
lot in the keynotes this week about

89
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,470
interesting ways that sd1 and

90
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,860
virtualization of networks are is

91
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,300
changing this is also happening

92
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:09,660
significantly on the enterprise we see

93
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:12,300
almost every telco that we work with and

94
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,690
most enterprises investing in some type

95
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,970
of SV win and they do this in order to

96
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,219
get that flexibility but it creates a

97
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,800
lot of challenges for us as networking

98
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,870
professionals because it's hard to

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,729
diagnose and debug these things that

100
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,050
abstract a lot of what we're used to

101
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:30,159
dealing with

102
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,320
additionally if you have to integrate

103
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,690
with these solutions they all have

104
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,300
different api's different formats for

105
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,520
telemetry there's so much variance in

106
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,860
here that it's really hard to manage

107
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,650
them it's hard to automate them it's

108
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,060
hard to troubleshoot them and this is

109
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,820
just going to continue getting more

110
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:53,710
complex as we layer more on top of the

111
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:57,219
onion so to speak and so what we've seen

112
00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:01,150
over time and I'm surprised that Damien

113
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:03,280
said he was not expecting people to have

114
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,250
more automation systems over the last

115
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,950
three years but I definitely see people

116
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,530
adopting more automation systems to deal

117
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:14,289
with these new layers if you sort of

118
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:17,679
rewind to what we were doing 10 to 15

119
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:20,230
years ago these NCCM type tools would

120
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,720
connect and manage traditional Network

121
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:25,090
environments in terms of being able to

122
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,280
scale out a software upgrade or deploy

123
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:29,799
an Akal across a large distributed

124
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,109
network they would do some of these big

125
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,870
bulk changes and allow you to understand

126
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,960
the network's I manage several of these

127
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,930
tools across pretty large networks you

128
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,739
know 30,000 Network Devices and they did

129
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,930
a pretty good job but they really lacked

130
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:50,920
running things in a in a code forward

131
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:53,380
method so as people have moved towards

132
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,200
DevOps and looking at infrastructure as

133
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:59,080
code these network orchestration type

134
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,539
systems ansible obviously being the most

135
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,270
common one is really where people have

136
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,730
moved around their tooling but what we

137
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,760
start seeing is that when you look at

138
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:13,150
nsx and ACI and some of these new policy

139
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,130
based systems that really abstract away

140
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,070
a lot of the network constructs and lets

141
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,900
us control application layers and of

142
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,700
course these same vendors are talking

143
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,099
about this intent based system that

144
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,680
they're expecting to build at some point

145
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,400
in the future that's really fantasy at

146
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,870
this point but sounds great in marketing

147
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,049
we'll see where that whole thing goes

148
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:38,950
but it's clearly getting a lot of buzz

149
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:41,289
but not a lot of reality yet so that is

150
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,719
where you know things are going around

151
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:45,729
Automation we'll see how much of this is

152
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:48,759
smoke and mirrors and how much of it is

153
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:52,180
real but the transition towards that

154
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:56,169
code-based infrastructure management is

155
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:58,539
definitely happening and Damien

156
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:00,369
obviously used much cleaner data from

157
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:03,399
the survey I sort of used the raw data

158
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:05,110
here and he talked about the survey so

159
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:07,539
I'm not going to go into the details

160
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,360
behind it but ansible is clearly the

161
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:13,688
tool that we see across our customers

162
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,089
and just from speaking to folks in terms

163
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:18,490
of where they're going but the challenge

164
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:20,740
is that ansible isn't in itself and

165
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,719
out-of-the-box easy to use system you

166
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,219
have to write a lot of code so this

167
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:26,469
means that you really need different

168
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:29,349
types of engineers and I'll talk about

169
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:31,629
that in a minute the other thing that

170
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:34,419
Damien also touched on is how broken

171
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:36,759
monitoring is if you had told me 10

172
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:39,430
years ago that we would still be doing

173
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,529
ping and up/down monitoring as our

174
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,849
primary method of understanding the

175
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:45,519
network I would have called you crazy

176
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:48,580
because I was doing packet capture and

177
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:50,800
flow analytics 10-15 years ago and

178
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,419
people today still aren't doing these

179
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,439
things which I find depressing

180
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:58,959
disheartening I don't know you want to

181
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:02,199
call it but hopefully this will change

182
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:07,330
because because monitoring has some some

183
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:09,490
serious challenges but this move to you

184
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:12,849
know infrastructure as code and managing

185
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,860
the code is definitely is real it's

186
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:16,779
happening it's already happened on the

187
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,539
most of the infrastructure but the

188
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:21,999
network is coming along too the

189
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:26,529
challenge here is really that many of

190
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:28,809
these tools are really toolkits and some

191
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:31,808
of the tools that are out there like nor

192
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:33,579
near for example aren't inherently built

193
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:35,199
to just manage the network they're

194
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:38,828
really built to manage everything

195
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:41,348
so although napalm is a network specific

196
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:43,679
toolkit and is extremely popular with

197
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:46,839
users of ansible to provide additional

198
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,319
capabilities on top some of these other

199
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,500
tools are really very rudimentary

200
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:52,589
toolkits

201
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,650
some of them have a lot of vendor

202
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,810
restrictions to them

203
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:59,870
Napalm only supports a few of the

204
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:03,500
leading manufacturers of networked

205
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:05,630
devices that Nikko actually supports a

206
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,910
lot more devices but there are some that

207
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:11,450
are in sort of like a limited level of

208
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,459
support as well and as Damien Damien

209
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:16,220
also hinted on there's a stamp there's

210
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:19,160
not a standard implementation here so

211
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:21,530
every time a new engineer comes in and

212
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,709
sets one of these systems up it's going

213
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:27,230
to be different than every other company

214
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:29,150
so it's really difficult to figure out

215
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,550
best practices which is why it's

216
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,380
important to participate in communities

217
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,569
and understand what other people are

218
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,320
doing so that you can try to find the

219
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,090
best thing to fit your environment and

220
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,160
then finally the challenge with the

221
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:45,530
infrastructure is code things is that it

222
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,530
doesn't support existing automation or

223
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:50,480
existing configuration so for many

224
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:53,089
organizations that are setting up a new

225
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,250
network they'll start from scratch with

226
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:58,430
something like ansible which is a great

227
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:00,710
situation to be in unfortunately most of

228
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,319
us have existing infrastructure to

229
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:06,860
manage so it's very difficult to make

230
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,650
that transition just because you have to

231
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:14,480
deal with what is in place today as you

232
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:18,439
build for the future so definitely a

233
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,180
challenge the other thing is modeling

234
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,580
the network and understanding current

235
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,560
configuration is a big challenge

236
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,990
so although net comp which has been

237
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,760
extensively covered here over the last

238
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:33,050
four or five years and I won't go into

239
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:36,470
it it is a good good attempt at

240
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:39,829
standardization it still has its own set

241
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:41,720
of challenges which means that for

242
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:43,820
someone like Kent ik where we're really

243
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,610
trying to understand the infrastructure

244
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:49,339
we can't just rely on net comp we

245
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:51,560
actually have to do things like SNMP we

246
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:55,040
have to use other methods to discover

247
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,810
and understand what the devices are so

248
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,790
although there are standards here

249
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,219
they're not implemented in standard ways

250
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:04,099
so it becomes very difficult as you have

251
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,560
a complex network if you're lucky to

252
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,060
have standardize your entire network on

253
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,430
a single vendor or

254
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,170
a single platform of a single vendor

255
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:14,479
then that's great

256
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:17,060
but we don't see that as as something

257
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,100
that commonly happens just because we

258
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:23,270
build over time and you get this you

259
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:26,450
know change that's happening another

260
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:28,460
topic which I am actually currently

261
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:31,280
writing a blog about is really is

262
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:33,680
streaming telemetry and how variant it

263
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,230
is across the vendors and the platform's

264
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,770
so many of you would love to get rid of

265
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,630
SNMP I don't particularly think SNMP is

266
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,510
a wonderful protocol it's definitely

267
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,030
very old but the transition to streaming

268
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,350
telemetry is a big challenge because

269
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,900
it's missing a lot of the

270
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:53,840
standards-based things that we built

271
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,939
with SNMP and so there's a lot of

272
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,610
challenges around what you can use

273
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:01,160
streaming telemetry for and what you

274
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:03,650
still need SNMP for so this is still

275
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,319
evolving and I wish we had some

276
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:09,860
standards behind streaming telemetry

277
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,810
like we did with SNMP some rfcs would

278
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:18,050
would definitely be be nice to have

279
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:20,750
there so I'm gonna I was actually gonna

280
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:22,910
show some demos but I found out on

281
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,040
Sunday that I couldn't do a live demo on

282
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,319
stage because there's no place to plug

283
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,530
laptops in so I recorded a couple short

284
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,500
videos to show a few things but before I

285
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:35,060
jump into that I'm gonna be showing a

286
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,890
little bit about some of the things that

287
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:38,540
damien mentioned around chat offs

288
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,030
because i do believe that that is

289
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:44,660
important a lot of these cutting edge

290
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:47,060
customers that use cantik today also

291
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,280
build their own chat box and have

292
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,589
integrated with lots of other systems a

293
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,189
really common one that we see is in that

294
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:58,550
box very popular I'm sure many of you

295
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:01,070
are using it it is a great system but it

296
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:04,010
requires some manual work to get it

297
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,200
populated and keep it up to date it's

298
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:08,960
pretty nice because it really can show

299
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,210
you how your network is set up what

300
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,150
types of devices you have how things are

301
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:16,220
connected and it's a great single source

302
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:18,829
source of truth but it does require some

303
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,029
work to get up and running and make it

304
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,259
useful

305
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:26,949
so I'm going to show you a little bit

306
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:31,209
about about chat ops and where we think

307
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:33,579
things are going the idea is really most

308
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:35,429
of us use a slack or a Microsoft teams

309
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:38,378
or maybe some of the open source

310
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:41,199
projects out there to chat among

311
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:45,819
ourselves but these tools essentially

312
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:48,758
allow you to interact with a bot in a in

313
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:50,649
a in a chat room and collaborate more

314
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:52,509
easily especially when you're

315
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:54,850
troubleshooting problems you can bring

316
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:56,829
this data in directly to a conversation

317
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:00,309
it really creates a much more

318
00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:02,738
collaborative environment so we're

319
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:05,019
working with network to code to open

320
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:07,689
source a chat bot that has a bunch of

321
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:09,459
integrations out of the box I'm going to

322
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:11,498
show you a little bit of this you can

323
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:13,839
see more details if you grab these

324
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:16,839
slides and look at that URL there's a

325
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,850
more extensive demo but the idea is how

326
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:21,160
can we bring together some of these

327
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:23,829
common tools that folks are using as

328
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:30,160
they try to change their operations as

329
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:32,888
well so a quick little demo of a chat

330
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,749
bot interacting with netbox

331
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:39,069
so I'm going to show you here in the

332
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:42,490
video that this is a copy of net box and

333
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:45,339
I can basically click on my sites here I

334
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,499
can pull up a site like Los Angeles I

335
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:50,619
can look at the devices that are on the

336
00:14:47,499 --> 00:14:52,449
site some configuration information now

337
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:54,970
I'm switching over to slack and I can

338
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:58,118
actually make a command right here

339
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,889
to net box the same type of way tell it

340
00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:02,259
that I'm interested in looking at a

341
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:05,499
particular site pick the same Los

342
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:07,480
Angeles site click Submit and instantly

343
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:10,449
I get the same type of data but it's a

344
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,749
much faster way to interact on using

345
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:15,479
that silly mouse thing you know so it

346
00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:18,249
just kind of gives you an easier way to

347
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,049
collaborate and communicate and work

348
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:22,059
together as a team on troubleshooting

349
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:24,369
problems or understanding what's

350
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:28,540
happening in your environment so that's

351
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:30,850
kind of one example in this next example

352
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:33,009
I'm going to do a similar thing and show

353
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,540
you in Ken tech you know something that

354
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:37,630
we can pull up here

355
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:40,930
sort of show show us show me are my top

356
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:44,020
net flow sources in terms of the devices

357
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:46,750
that we're seeing sending flow data in I

358
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:49,569
can easily pick a you know save view

359
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:52,420
within Kent ik right from the chat bot

360
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:54,640
it then pulls up the graph that I want

361
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,520
to look at I can see what devices are

362
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:59,830
sending at most I can do the same exact

363
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,650
thing thing in Kent ik search for a save

364
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:05,110
view the same type of data essentially

365
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:08,079
comes up the same exact graph and view

366
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:10,000
and I can see you know what's sending

367
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,460
the data and start slicing and dicing

368
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,790
from there but it just kind of makes it

369
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:18,220
easier for you to see that data

370
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,290
instantly in a collaborative team view

371
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,570
versus work everyone working in their

372
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:25,349
own tools and their own browsers and

373
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,670
such so there's kind of the idea between

374
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:31,390
what we're trying to build with the chat

375
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:34,300
bot and really why we see this as being

376
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,819
a future path that a lot of teams are

377
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,500
moving towards for running automation

378
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:43,030
and and collaborating and

379
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:44,860
troubleshooting together and Damian also

380
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:48,790
talked a little bit about some of the

381
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:51,840
tools that folks are using most people

382
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:54,339
will start with a CI type system so

383
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,830
naturally the sort of the first steps

384
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,720
that you do is take your configurations

385
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:01,330
and store them and get some type of

386
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,250
source control system and that most

387
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:05,170
people will build start building a

388
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,690
pipeline let's say I want to automate

389
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:09,510
some of the verifications some of the

390
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:12,370
checking that happens when a new

391
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,990
configuration is committed people will

392
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:17,619
start stringing together these different

393
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:20,109
tools typically in Python and they'll

394
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:22,599
run that with a system the most common

395
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:26,829
being Jenkins is an open source CI

396
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:29,260
system but gitlab has a really nice CI

397
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:32,350
system as well and yet is also

398
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:34,780
integrated with it git lab is a SAS

399
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,550
service but they also it's open source

400
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,649
so you can download it and install the

401
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:42,100
whole system on Prem if you want to as

402
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:43,870
well there was also a talk yesterday

403
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,879
about batfish and that's definitely

404
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,870
something that we commonly see for

405
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,990
validating some of your policy

406
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,820
as this gets checked in the idea is to

407
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,700
try to eliminate some of the errors

408
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,980
automate some of the the checks and

409
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,860
verification and other things that you

410
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,409
would want to do and then of course as

411
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,479
you get more advanced some folks will do

412
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:07,760
instant deployment of that it runs

413
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,440
through all their verifications they see

414
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,600
that it checks out and then they'll

415
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:16,299
actually do the deployment directly with

416
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,980
ansible it's it's pretty hard to

417
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:21,710
retrofit an existing network to do this

418
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,450
type of thing but as you evolve you can

419
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,490
start automating more of this pipeline

420
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,669
and be more confident in these

421
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:31,549
incremental changes and so that's the

422
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:34,429
goal is instead of doing a big Thursday

423
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:36,190
night change window push of everything

424
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:38,659
that you're doing is incrementally

425
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,789
releasing these things and being able to

426
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:44,020
better manage and rollback when you have

427
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:47,539
problems and so it is important as you

428
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:49,220
build these types of pipelines and the

429
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:52,450
verification that you do that

430
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:54,880
closed-loop type system so incorporating

431
00:18:52,450 --> 00:19:00,200
monitoring or running a synthetic test

432
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:02,149
let's say you close a firewall or you

433
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,700
close a port on an apple or something

434
00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:06,739
like that you would run a test and make

435
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,200
sure that that was in fact closed and

436
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:11,240
that the connection didn't go through so

437
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,549
people will often incorporate that type

438
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,210
of testing it's almost like unit testing

439
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:19,460
with the code that they commit and it is

440
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:21,830
really common as you go into continuous

441
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:25,370
deployment that your deploys fail that

442
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:26,809
is totally normal and there's nothing

443
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:30,260
wrong with it don't think of it as a

444
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:32,120
failed release or a failed build it's

445
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:34,309
really just part of doing these

446
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,889
incremental changes that things do fail

447
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:39,408
the screenshot on the bottom is actually

448
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:43,399
a pretty advanced CD system called

449
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:46,419
harness and managing that failure is

450
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:49,189
definitely part of any CD strategy is

451
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:51,500
understanding we've failed how do we

452
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:53,270
revert things back quickly and make sure

453
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,419
things are back in the state they were

454
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:58,908
before the change so it is an important

455
00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:01,309
part of understanding continuous

456
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:05,600
deployment is that that failure is

457
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:09,950
spected and it is normal it's how you

458
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,498
recover so a couple of things that are

459
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:15,470
happening more broadly in the industry

460
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:17,149
there's a new term and a new market

461
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:19,850
that's been forming over the last few

462
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:23,149
years called AI ops something that we've

463
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:25,939
been part of it can take for sure but

464
00:20:23,149 --> 00:20:28,668
the idea here and and this is a Gartner

465
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,700
terminology in terms of what they're

466
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:33,169
seeing happening in the industry we see

467
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,110
a lot of folks building this with

468
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:38,720
open-source or using you know commercial

469
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:41,479
technologies but the idea is how do I

470
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:45,070
bring all of this data the configuration

471
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:48,470
the logs the metrics the traffic and

472
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:50,658
store this in a central system and the

473
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,909
ideas of course first monitoring and

474
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:54,830
understanding what's happening but being

475
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:58,490
able to drive service management

476
00:20:54,830 --> 00:21:00,259
ticketing paging and then obviously the

477
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,749
ultimate goal is to tie in to that

478
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:05,360
automation and make this a closed-loop

479
00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:06,980
system so there's a lot of things that

480
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,889
you can accomplish with a system like

481
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,990
this but it's a new type of technology

482
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:15,110
and the market is still really evolving

483
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:17,389
so it's very immature and fragmented and

484
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:19,309
not well understood but the goal is

485
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:22,789
really how do we do this closed-loop

486
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:25,149
type a type of thing that we've been

487
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:27,740
truck that we've been talking about here

488
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:30,529
so you can kind of think of this as like

489
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:33,619
an evolution of phases where you start

490
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:35,299
off by monitoring and ultimately you

491
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:36,889
want to get all the way to that goal of

492
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:38,960
automation and there's a lot of steps

493
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:41,149
and things that you can use these types

494
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,669
of systems to improve within your

495
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:47,539
organization that are in between those

496
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:49,850
two sort of methods so this is is kind

497
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,408
of where these platforms are evolving to

498
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,678
and I'm sure we'll see lots of great

499
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:57,769
open source also facilitating some of

500
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:59,539
this but it's an exciting area because

501
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:02,269
it's really how we start taking this

502
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:05,330
data and tying it to automation and

503
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:09,529
making that easier for everyone which i

504
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:11,918
think is a very valid goal and really

505
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:14,500
it's it's supposed to help us identify

506
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,200
these problems and what's happening

507
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,840
sooner prioritize what's the most

508
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,750
important and then get more out of our

509
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,320
people by better automation in closing

510
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:28,780
the loop with these things so that's

511
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,020
kind of a you know an overview of what

512
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:34,030
we're seeing but it's not fully reality

513
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,680
it's still formulating and coming

514
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:41,770
together and and I think we'll see that

515
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:45,310
get much better so with that I'm open to

516
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:48,720
take a few questions and thanks everyone

517
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,720
for for listening
