1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
hello everyone I am Lukas ani I am a

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:08,160
catch point engineer working on bgp

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,099
monitoring and now I am going to present

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,269
you to present you a work done together

5
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:17,520
with my colleague Alessandro in prata

6
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:20,250
since this is this is the first analogue

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,640
of the year we thought that could have

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,740
been nice to give a summary of what

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,330
happened from bgp security perspective

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:33,180
last year so it is well known that BGP

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,849
is not immune to security problems in

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,860
particular to routing incidents we can

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,469
have an estimate number of the incidents

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,829
that happened during time by looking at

15
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:47,910
the BGP stream web page this page

16
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:50,489
reports the incidents perceived by BGP

17
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,890
stream and classifies them on the basis

18
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:56,129
of their natural in particular we are

19
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,680
interested in hijacks and leaks as you

20
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:01,349
can see from these numbers during each

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,140
month of last year hundreds of incidents

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,560
happened in particular there is a peak

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:11,850
in June of last year where also the leak

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,030
affecting CloudFlare happened so the

25
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,179
main problem is that BGP wasn't designed

26
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,540
with the security in mind by looking for

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,600
example at public interviews release it

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,880
by BGP authors we can say that when BGP

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,470
was designed security wasn't even on the

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,960
table and the main goal was just to get

31
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,170
the internet work

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:40,500
so this is why BGP lacks of an intrinsic

33
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:43,140
mechanism to secure packets and this is

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,930
why it is prone to miss configurations

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:50,189
and attacks in particular Ajax and leaks

36
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:53,610
a magic occurs when an autonomous system

37
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,648
claims to be the origin for a portion of

38
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,799
IP space that actually has been

39
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,990
allocated to another one for example in

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,689
this slide you can see that the

41
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,280
autonomous system v claims to be the

42
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,779
origin for the traffic speed which

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,140
actually has been allocated to

44
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:13,720
autonomous system for autonomous system

45
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:15,700
v sends this BGP message to its BGP

46
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,550
neighborhoods which may or may not

47
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,380
accept the announcement for the sake of

48
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:22,450
the example suppose that autonomous

49
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,730
entrie accept the announcement and

50
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:27,579
propagates this information to its

51
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:30,489
neighbors and again suppose that as1

52
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:33,310
accept the announcement the consequence

53
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,920
is that all the traffic from a s1 and

54
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,650
es3 directed to p will be actually

55
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,470
received by a flume assistant v instead

56
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,530
of Otto knows yourself for at this point

57
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:48,840
the destiny of the traffic depends on

58
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:51,730
the intention of a s5 if the age Act was

59
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,520
created by a mistake probably the

60
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,440
traffic will be just dropped causing a

61
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,580
denial of the services running on

62
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,320
traffic speed on the other hand if the

63
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,470
attack was done on purpose

64
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,150
yes v could inspect the traffic or even

65
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,790
words could try to impersonate the

66
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,310
services so running on a P trying for

67
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:17,170
example to steal login credentials from

68
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:20,050
end users this kind of a jack is often

69
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:21,820
called miss origin hijack because it is

70
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,430
clear from the auto loan system path

71
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:28,329
that the most right of the MU system

72
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:30,640
number is not the expected one more

73
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,970
complicated versions of vie Jack's exist

74
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,010
for example one version is called a s

75
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,200
pass forgery where the attacker on

76
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,810
purpose includes into the afternoon

77
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,390
system part as the most right autonomous

78
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:46,989
system number the number of the expected

79
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:49,299
origin with the him to make the attack

80
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:53,350
more difficult to be detected by VG be

81
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:56,200
monitoring the platform so the other

82
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:59,769
class of incidents we are interested on

83
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,420
is the class of Route leaks an outlet

84
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,820
can be formally defined as the

85
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,730
propagation of BGP announcement beyond

86
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:09,430
its intended scope the scope can be

87
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:12,190
defined using the BGP import and export

88
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,890
policies which govern the set of routes

89
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:17,950
that two autonomous system is exchanged

90
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:20,469
on a BGP session very roughly these

91
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,370
policies can be classified in two main

92
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,070
categories

93
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,020
customer provider and peer-to-peer in a

94
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,490
customer provider a policy in the

95
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,859
customer announces to the

96
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,660
provider the routes to reach its

97
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,120
networks and the networks of its

98
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,460
customers while the provider announces

99
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,280
to the customer the network the routes

100
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,888
to reach all the internet networks on

101
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,780
the other end in a peer-to-peer policy

102
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:46,810
if you have the most systems exchange

103
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,330
routes to reach its respective networks

104
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:53,380
and the networks of its respective

105
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:55,210
customers so a leak happens when an

106
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,759
autonomous system propagates are out

107
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,609
learned from peer or a provider to

108
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,460
another peer or a provider for example

109
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:05,860
in this slide suppose that autonomous

110
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,930
system five is customer of autonomous

111
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,990
system four and peer of autonomous

112
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,509
system three areas for announces to as5

113
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:16,360
dalish ability of prefix P and by

114
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:20,919
mistake a s5 propagates this information

115
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,990
to a s3 if a s3 accept this route on the

116
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:25,229
traffic from a s3 in the directed to P

117
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:28,389
will pass through autonomous system five

118
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:30,940
so the factor of no system five will be

119
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:34,210
a transit between appear and a provider

120
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,039
for that kind of traffic the main

121
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:38,109
consequence of a leak usually is

122
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,240
performance degradation because the

123
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,490
autonomous system causing the leak will

124
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,030
have to handle an unexpected amount of

125
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:48,039
traffic and its network may be under

126
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:52,030
provisioned in order to handle this kind

127
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:54,370
of traffic and it could be could also

128
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,619
been be done intentionally with the

129
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,630
purpose of stealing the traffic that

130
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,750
anyway will be interacted to the proper

131
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,940
destination now we are going to analyze

132
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,949
three relevant cases that happened

133
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:09,340
during last year the first case is a

134
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:11,199
leak

135
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,739
involving a Swiss and data center

136
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,599
colocation company named the safe host

137
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,199
this leak at the new G impact in the

138
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:19,870
news

139
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,789
mainly because it involved also directly

140
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:23,560
China Telecom so all the news

141
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:26,318
highlighted the fact that a lot of

142
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:30,669
Internet traffic was redirected through

143
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:33,419
China so what happened is that in the

144
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:37,198
morning of the 6th of June of last year

145
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:39,549
the Swiss autonomous system say first

146
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,100
started to announce to its provider

147
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,770
China Telecom

148
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:47,580
than forty thousand hundred forty

149
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:50,640
thousand routes learned from other peers

150
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,640
and provided those routes involvement

151
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,770
both prefixes or Rida present in the

152
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,020
routing table as well as prefixes not

153
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:01,620
present in this case we observe the bots

154
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,630
more and less specific graphics is China

155
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,240
Telecom internal accepted all these

156
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,370
routes and propagated them to its

157
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,050
neighbors the factor contributing to

158
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,050
spread the leak on a global scale

159
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:19,760
the leak also reach the autonomous

160
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,710
systems connect the two public raft

161
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,510
collective wrapped user race and in the

162
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:28,080
bottom of this slide for example you can

163
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:30,150
see a few examples of liquid routes you

164
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,070
can notice the presence of the

165
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,349
autonomous system of China Telecom for

166
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,870
one three four and the presence of the

167
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,150
Ottoman systems of safest to one two and

168
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:42,300
seven also you can notice the presence

169
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,580
of a pretending as if say first didn't

170
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:49,380
want to use the link with the China

171
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:53,090
Telecom for both routes so we tried to

172
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:55,580
analyze the global impact of the leak by

173
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:58,590
analyzing the analyzing the amount of

174
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,830
peers connected to our out collector

175
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,390
that received at least one occurred out

176
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,969
to perform this analysis we downloaded

177
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:08,340
all the available update messages from

178
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:11,280
route views and right press archives and

179
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,049
as you can see from the pie in the left

180
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,849
of the slide

181
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,710
almost all peers connected to our out

182
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,410
collector receiver at least and one

183
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:22,289
naked route to be more precise we have

184
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,210
to say that we consider a Dali the peers

185
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,660
sharing a food routing table with the

186
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,669
collectors from another perspective by

187
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,539
looking at the histograms in the right

188
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:36,060
side of the slide we can say that the

189
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:40,860
leak was spread on a global scale

190
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:43,859
without saving any internet religion to

191
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,920
claim that we classified that their

192
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,920
peers receiving the likud routes on the

193
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,780
basis of the registry of membership the

194
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,469
registry of membership can be considered

195
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:58,640
a very very rough indication of

196
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:01,070
the location of appear so it is true

197
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,660
that almost all piers connected to a

198
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,300
route connect or receive it at least

199
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:08,030
Malik a drought but it is not true that

200
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:11,599
all piers receiving the same amount of

201
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:13,699
liquid routes to capture this concept we

202
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,830
plot the distribution of the number of

203
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,810
origins on the left and the number of

204
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,570
subnets on the right that each peer

205
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:23,150
perceive it as involved in a naked route

206
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:26,510
as you can see from the distribution for

207
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:28,880
example we can say that only the 20% of

208
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,910
peers receive at the likud routes

209
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,730
involving more than 100 sub 100 the

210
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,520
different origins of course the

211
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:40,490
collector peers directly connected to

212
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:43,010
China Telecom were the peers announcing

213
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,440
to the collector the AIC number of

214
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:48,260
liquid routes for example there were one

215
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,870
peer which announced the to the public

216
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,700
art collectors routes involving more

217
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,860
than three thousand different origins

218
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:59,600
and twenty five thousand different

219
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:02,570
subnets this leak lasted globally almost

220
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,150
four hours and during these four hours

221
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:07,490
more than six thousand different origins

222
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:10,430
were affected here you have the

223
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,020
distribution of the devolution of the

224
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,060
number of all regions affected by the

225
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:16,490
leak during time and you can see there

226
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:20,390
are several peaks for example there is

227
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:22,820
one peak around 10:40 a.m. where more

228
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,380
than 2000 different origins who were

229
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,500
affected at the same time

230
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,750
among those origins there were popular

231
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,780
services like whatsapp and Microsoft but

232
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:35,510
also Internet service providers transit

233
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,579
providers banks and all kinds of

234
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:41,600
autonomous system participating to today

235
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:45,230
internet another case that we

236
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:50,150
investigated involved animal system

237
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:52,520
located in the island of Taiwan this

238
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,439
incident didn't have a huge impact in

239
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,050
the news like the previous one however

240
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:02,270
it is interesting to analyze because it

241
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:03,920
is a perfect example of origin hijack so

242
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,079
the scenario is the following that is

243
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,520
the Taiwan Network Information Center

244
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:12,050
which lands the net

245
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:15,470
101 101 101 is less 24 on which it is

246
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:19,099
run the Public DNS project could quad

247
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:21,500
101 at some point during the 8th of May

248
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:25,400
of last year a Brazilian autonomous

249
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:28,040
system called fabric plus started to be

250
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,199
- claimed to be the legitimate origin

251
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,540
for that network and propagated this

252
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:36,230
announcement to its provider Clara

253
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:38,839
Brasil Clara Brasil accepted this

254
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:41,240
information and propagated them in this

255
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,490
information to its neighbors so Clara

256
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,840
Brazil is a medium large Internet

257
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,180
service provider in Brazil

258
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:50,540
so the facto contributed to spread the I

259
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,520
Jack on a global scale in the bottom of

260
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,640
this slide you can see a few examples of

261
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,020
the hijackers routes where you can

262
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,300
clearly see that the most right

263
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:02,810
autonomous system is the thermal system

264
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:06,260
of a fiber + differently from the

265
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:11,239
previous case which was a leak in this

266
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:13,610
case this network is announced at the

267
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,240
same time between two different

268
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:19,340
autonomous systems in Asia is announced

269
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,730
by taiwan network information centre and

270
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:28,220
in south america is announced by fiber

271
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:31,780
plus so if we analyze how these i jack

272
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:34,940
spread globally we can we can see that

273
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,410
the those autonomous system closer to

274
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,090
the hijacker network

275
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,939
so those autonomous systems located in

276
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:44,510
latnok tend to use their jacket router

277
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:47,030
so you see that all the bits in luck mix

278
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:49,280
basically accepted this route while

279
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:51,680
those of the most system closer to the

280
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:54,199
taiwan network information centre tend

281
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:59,750
to not use the ejecta drought as you can

282
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:02,000
see from the ethnic histogram the last

283
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,940
case that we analyzed is the case that

284
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,160
was previously present presented by mr.

285
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:11,000
levy so you want to go in much details

286
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:14,260
but i want to give you a view from what

287
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,290
can be seen from publicly available data

288
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:20,030
so this Nick at the new G impacting the

289
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:22,010
news mainly because eating

290
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:24,620
the famous autonomous systems like Club

291
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:27,319
Flair but also Facebook and Amazon and

292
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:31,130
also because Verizon was blamed for

293
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,050
spreading the leak so very briefly what

294
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:36,170
happened is that the autonomous system

295
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:39,589
of ATI propagated to its provided

296
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:41,810
Verizon thousands of routes learned from

297
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:45,410
another provider due to a communications

298
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:49,130
to be honest DQ a communication wasn't

299
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:51,680
supposed to generates those routes so

300
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:54,680
this is a perfect example of provided to

301
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,870
provide early internal Verizon accepted

302
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,170
all these routes and propagated them to

303
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:03,350
its neighbors among them there were

304
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:05,599
devil eyes on customers there were tire

305
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,580
one of the most systems that accepted

306
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,280
the routes and also other tier one

307
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,620
networks that drop at them because they

308
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:19,160
had in place stronger filtering

309
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:21,920
mechanisms like rpki or a pillock so on

310
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:24,800
a global scale the leak was perceived by

311
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,310
almost all of the most system connected

312
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,520
to a route collector with some exception

313
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:35,119
in the are in region those exceptions

314
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:37,819
include of most systems that interrupted

315
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,210
the routes thanks to filtering

316
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:43,250
mechanisms like for example AT&T and

317
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:45,410
entity and also their their respective

318
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:50,510
customers that were protected from the

319
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:52,969
leak again so it is true that almost all

320
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,470
peers connected to a route collect or

321
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,990
receive at at least two Malecha drought

322
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:59,060
but it is also true that not all peers

323
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:03,050
receive at all this the same amount of

324
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:06,410
liquid routes in particular in this case

325
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:08,890
you can see that Verizon which is also

326
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:12,020
connected to public Rock collectors

327
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:14,360
received and announced to the rock

328
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,760
collector liquid routes involving more

329
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:22,070
than four thousand different origins and

330
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:24,470
more than 65,000 different subnets the

331
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:27,620
leak lost the almost two hours and

332
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:30,410
during these two hours all these origins

333
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,750
were affected and among them there were

334
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,630
again famous autonomous systems like

335
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,780
phase

336
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:39,120
CloudFlare t-mobile Bloomberg also

337
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:41,400
American banks and so on and so forth so

338
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,560
every kind of internet play er was

339
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:48,689
affected so these were just three

340
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,760
relevant cases that we analyzed but many

341
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:54,240
many more happened during last year

342
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:58,860
again by looking at bgp Stream numbers

343
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,960
we can say that last year more than 600

344
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,510
autonomous systems were victim of an

345
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:08,790
attack and more than 800 autonomous

346
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:11,069
systems were victim of a big by we can

347
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,230
have a better understanding about the

348
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,570
nature of these autonomous system for

349
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:18,240
example if we try to rank them on the

350
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:20,610
basis of their sides to do that we use

351
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,950
the methodology provided by Qaeda which

352
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:26,600
is called es rank this methodology

353
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:29,040
allows you to have an estimate estimate

354
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,140
an estimation of the size of an

355
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,110
autonomous system on the basis of their

356
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:36,780
customers corner sides so as you can see

357
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,970
from these two PI's almost all kind of

358
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:42,780
autonomous system were affected from

359
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:45,690
smallest one to biggest one so non no

360
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:50,880
autonomous system is safe from leaks and

361
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:53,100
hijack also these numbers are very

362
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,890
likely to be underestimated mainly

363
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,450
because the number of autonomous systems

364
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,699
participating to a public route

365
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:04,380
collector is very limited and also

366
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:06,449
because not all of the system connected

367
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,610
to a route collector announce to the

368
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:11,449
collector everything that they receive

369
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:14,790
for example let's consider this scenario

370
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:17,100
where the raft collector R is connected

371
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:19,109
to autonomous system EE and let's

372
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:22,560
suppose that autonomous system C

373
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:24,300
generates a leak the likud route could

374
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,849
reach autonomous system e and now

375
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:29,669
suppose that e has in place a strong

376
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:32,790
filtering mechanism for example a PKI

377
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:35,130
validation so it drops the route in this

378
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:38,129
case the rock collector R will never be

379
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:42,660
able to see the likud route even if the

380
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:44,880
leak actually happened to have a proof

381
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,490
of that we try to plot the distribution

382
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,789
of the number of BGP stream

383
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:52,950
periods that detected they reported I

384
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:56,460
jackin leaks as you can see not all

385
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:59,370
pearson perceive it all the events for

386
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:03,570
example by looking at the route leaks we

387
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:06,270
can say that only the 40% of leaks were

388
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:11,580
participate by more than 20 which we

389
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:14,820
stream peers so what can we do about it

390
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:17,520
and what have been done about it since

391
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:20,610
BGP lacks of an intrinsic mechanism to

392
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,340
secure packets a lot of mechanisms have

393
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:26,699
been proposed during time the most

394
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,340
famous and user the one is rpki as you

395
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,210
know

396
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:34,740
so our pika is a powerful mechanism and

397
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:37,409
everyone should sign that prefixes

398
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:40,260
however it is also well known that it is

399
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:42,779
not enough to drop all the invalid

400
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,890
announcements for example as we are

401
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:48,750
going to see in a slide it can't drop

402
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,390
some kind of bgp leaks and intentional

403
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:55,110
attacks like yes but forgery or sub

404
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:57,929
prefix hijacks so let's consider again

405
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,449
the lickin area where after no system

406
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:03,750
for announces two five darisha bility of

407
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:07,500
p and suppose that after new system for

408
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:09,870
signed in the article database that it

409
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,080
is the legitimate origin to announce

410
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:15,779
traffic speed now let's suppose that

411
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,668
this announcement is propagated to by a

412
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,799
formal system five to Economo system

413
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:22,350
tree and then two autonomous system one

414
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:24,389
and let's say in let's say that in this

415
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,789
scenario autonomous system one is the

416
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,669
thermal system performing rpki

417
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:31,620
validation so upon receiving the BGP

418
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,110
announcement of an or system one will

419
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:36,840
look if the most right autonomous system

420
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:39,178
in the path is the expected origin for

421
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,789
the legitimate origin for the traffic

422
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:44,299
speed and the check in the end

423
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:49,020
PKI database will return valid because

424
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:53,970
prefix P has been registered by

425
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:55,620
autonomous system for so for this reason

426
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,080
a lot of other mechanisms have been

427
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,820
proposed during time for example which

428
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,309
basic where which P packets will be

429
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,678
ah graphically signed and also a lot of

430
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:08,408
other mechanisms are in discussion in

431
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:14,409
IETF in order to detect and drop

432
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:16,210
embodied the paths and leaks so I just

433
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:20,110
want to conclude this presentation by

434
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:23,159
saying that despite all these mechanisms

435
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:26,559
are in place and new mechanism will be

436
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:29,409
proposed bgp monitoring can be still

437
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:32,230
useful in order to detect and to react

438
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:34,120
as soon as possible to invalid

439
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:37,929
announcements that escape these

440
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:42,268
mechanisms so that's all if you have

441
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:42,269
questions I am happy to take that

442
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,449
