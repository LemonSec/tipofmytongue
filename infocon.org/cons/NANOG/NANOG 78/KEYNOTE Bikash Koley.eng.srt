1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,240
thank you for saying for very very kind

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,129
words and thank you all for taking the

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,259
time from your busy days in in coming

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,240
here you know I have been doing

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,330
networking and I've been associated with

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,189
the networking space for give or take

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,359
almost three decades now in fact you

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,640
know when I look back and think about

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,619
what I've been doing in my professional

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,420
life I think networking is the only

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,890
thing that I really know so if I'm not

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,270
doing it working and probably not very

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,500
useful but also because I've been spent

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,020
has been quite a bit of time here just

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,610
like many of you I'm sure you look back

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,739
and you think about what you have done

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,590
in all this time I've been thinking

18
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,379
quite hard about what networking has

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,940
done for us and I'm still amazed even

20
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,510
though we live in the middle of it all

21
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,250
of you do I'm still amazed with how

22
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:56,820
fundamental networking has been to how

23
00:00:53,250 --> 00:01:00,510
we live how we connect how we consume

24
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:03,180
information how our daily life is today

25
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,128
right and when I think through it you

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,290
know what I found interesting is that at

27
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,490
at least as far as I have been in this

28
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,729
space and maybe there are other

29
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,439
inflection that happened before I find

30
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,500
that there are three distinct eras that

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,729
networking has gone to I call them for

32
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,920
the eaves of 81.0 - oh and three dotto

33
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,179
we are just at the beginning of Kyoto

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,100
and I'm actually going to walk you

35
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,770
through that and and explain what I mean

36
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,199
by this errors but what I find is that

37
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,110
in each of the era of networking there

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,079
was always a killer app and that killer

39
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,509
application ultimately drove significant

40
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,658
inflection in to networking technologies

41
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,759
into network operations into the use

42
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,610
cases of network and how network gets

43
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,000
consumed and as a result the technology

44
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,100
itself evolved in in step function ways

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,460
so let's start with networking one dot

46
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,770
home so this really started you know bad

47
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,520
all days of telephony and it has it has

48
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:04,048
grown over many years the real killer

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,240
application of networking when it really

50
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,450
started was really connectivity it was

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,750
all about connecting people to people or

52
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,799
places to places that was the killer

53
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,840
application

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,060
and that killer application you know

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,980
sort of evolved over time you know it

56
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,800
took various form from circuits sewage

57
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,380
to cell sewage to label sewage to lambda

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,660
switch to packet switched and it's still

59
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,430
happening so on and so forth right but

60
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,700
the common characteristics that you see

61
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,840
with this phase of networking is that

62
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,600
it's really about connectivity

63
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,060
it's about people on two ends of the

64
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,470
connection or places on two ends of the

65
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,160
collection connections I mean the early

66
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,650
days interestingly those one thing that

67
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,540
we talk about a lot things Internet of

68
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,060
Things was not a thing at the time and

69
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,239
we're talking about free internet you

70
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,190
know 80s potentially 70s right where it

71
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,260
was really about connecting people and

72
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,680
places because things were still not

73
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,510
quite there and it took various form now

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,540
this network actually had some pretty

75
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,310
clear characteristics it was it is

76
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,070
really best described by the wayside

77
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,350
seven-layer where there's clear layering

78
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,329
as to how this connection happened there

79
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,420
was clear description of client-server

80
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,220
relationship between these layers and

81
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,320
the two endpoints that you're connecting

82
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,670
could really exist in one layer of the

83
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,160
network they couldn't actually go across

84
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,350
the layers and the layers to each other

85
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,760
were more or less opaque and there are a

86
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,280
lot of good results why that happened

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,380
one of the biggest reason that this

88
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,720
clear layering was important was because

89
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,450
in those days CPUs are not very powerful

90
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,800
so it was not real easy for the control

91
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,690
and the management plane to really

92
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,760
Reason through the layers because they

93
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,200
did not have as many cycles so it's very

94
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,790
important that you treat the other

95
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,230
layers as opaque and really deal with a

96
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,760
layer that you are that you are in right

97
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,890
and that's how most of the network was

98
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,660
built in those days I'm sure many of you

99
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,970
have lived through this or for many many

100
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,010
many years there's another

101
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,230
characteristic that was pretty distinct

102
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,350
during that time so if you think of what

103
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,679
you are connecting either people or

104
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,359
places essentially lead to a n square

105
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,390
relationship of how many connections you

106
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,060
have now neither people nor places

107
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:19,168
actually grew very rapidly I mean be on

108
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,180
a relative scale so our biggest friend

109
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:24,090
was Moore's law because every 18 months

110
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,830
or so we actually got Network technology

111
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:32,378
that were about double as efficient as

112
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:34,599
as capable or as as capacity that we are

113
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:36,490
able to deploy right so the main

114
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:39,610
approach that we took for networking was

115
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:43,180
what I call scale-up we all built this

116
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:45,610
very large chassis based systems they

117
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,349
allowed various forms of connections in

118
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,639
them increasingly multiple forms of

119
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:50,530
connections who is to call them hot

120
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,419
boxes you know it was IP over Ethernet

121
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:56,799
over ATM over so on and so forth

122
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:59,109
various forms of those every 18 months

123
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,759
or so we actually got a capacity upgrade

124
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,590
on this buses we actually allowed us to

125
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,120
keep keep up with the new capacity

126
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,698
demand that we had you know you know

127
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,259
networks and more or less you know once

128
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:09,400
it deployed this chassis that remained

129
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:12,370
there for quite some time

130
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,349
their numbers did not increase very

131
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:16,180
rapidly but their capacity of obviously

132
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:19,840
grew but the Nama did not increase very

133
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:24,069
rapidly this boxes were also built with

134
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,378
very closely coupled systems that kept

135
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:29,379
data control and management plan very

136
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:31,330
close to each other they're built more

137
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:33,969
often than not with proprietary systems

138
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,250
started all the way from the ASIC that

139
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:38,830
went into the box to the low-level

140
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,120
software that controlled those ASIC to

141
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,060
ultimately the control on the management

142
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,879
plane software and the very interesting

143
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,860
part in that era was that standards even

144
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:51,129
though they existed did not always

145
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,990
guarantee interoperability data plane

146
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:57,550
mostly in turn operated console flame

147
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:59,259
depended you know BGP of two suppliers

148
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:02,050
did not always talk to each other or

149
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,759
mean the same thing management plan was

150
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,460
very far from actually interoperating

151
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,169
the the CLI so different LMSs are

152
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,580
different there weren't clear api's on

153
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:15,128
the Nemesis applications you know those

154
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,409
very few ones that actually use Network

155
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:19,330
they view network as peer connectivity

156
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:21,099
layer it was dumb pipe like that's all

157
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,990
the network bit as far as applications

158
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:24,520
are concerned and networks themselves

159
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:27,210
did not care too much about what the

160
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,279
applications who are doing on them and

161
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:33,128
the most interesting bits that those of

162
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,740
you who are in the networking space or

163
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:37,389
say less than 10 years if you look back

164
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,090
you'll find surprising that in those

165
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:42,250
days if you were starting early

166
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,530
tiny project in a garage to build a

167
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,150
network system of any sort it was

168
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,710
immensely difficult because there was no

169
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,599
thing called Marcin silicon you couldn't

170
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,060
really go and get a little motherboard

171
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,250
and start doing stuff there wasn't that

172
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,870
much of an open-source networking stack

173
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,280
either like there was previously which

174
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,500
had a decent networking stack but

175
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,919
remember this was before Linux was a

176
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:06,100
thing right so your only option of

177
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:07,990
building network was either to be to

178
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,760
work for a large company that was

179
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,110
building networking systems or buy from

180
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,789
them those are really your two options

181
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,590
and that's what most of the network

182
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,120
operators did did they went to one of

183
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,030
those companies and the mostly bought

184
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:23,410
things from them it was a fairly closed

185
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:25,690
system at that time the other thing that

186
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,490
also signifies this time was how these

187
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,729
networks are operated now you know one

188
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:33,250
of the good property of scale-up was

189
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:36,340
that the number of elements that you had

190
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:39,220
in a network did not scale by order of

191
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:41,440
magnitude over time because those same

192
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,450
systems allow allow you to grow capacity

193
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,270
without having to add more systems so

194
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,719
more or less if you were an operator and

195
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:52,719
if you're trying to figure out how much

196
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,490
how much optics I need to spend in this

197
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,650
infrastructure and how I want to run

198
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,720
that you essentially associated X number

199
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,640
of operators with running this

200
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,410
infrastructure those by the way were

201
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,880
highly skilled operators because they

202
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:07,930
they were expert in this specific set of

203
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,659
networking technologies often from

204
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:13,030
specific vendors and often with specific

205
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,950
domain and that model actually worked

206
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,080
because again your number of elements in

207
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:19,419
the network did not grow that much so

208
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,070
these experts were highly valued as as

209
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:23,680
they actually knew how the system's

210
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,490
worked inside out and they were at work

211
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,650
every single day

212
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:30,130
running this infrastructure and that

213
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:32,740
went on for many many many years I would

214
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,750
say you know good 20 to 30 years from

215
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,279
70s to early 90s and and that model

216
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,900
reasonably worked many of us have

217
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:39,669
actually built infrastructure or network

218
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,958
that followed exactly that model and

219
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:42,968
have been successful in building

220
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,540
networks and businesses in many cases

221
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:51,870
right now came a very large inflection

222
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:54,959
in really 1990s early 1990s mid 1990s

223
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:57,029
and that led to what I call networking -

224
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,220
righto which has very distinct

225
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:01,230
properties that are different from what

226
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,910
happened in networking wondered oh that

227
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,000
infection is really called public

228
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:08,219
Internet it's when internet became

229
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,620
ubiquitous to how we live day in and day

230
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,680
out the need for network and what

231
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,390
network did completely change it

232
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,949
obviously started out with Netscape and

233
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,170
other products like that but the real

234
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,970
inflation started happening when we got

235
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:24,750
multimedia applications like YouTube

236
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,760
like Netflix Facebook Instagram coming

237
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,589
into coming into picture enterprises

238
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,900
moving to video conferencing that were

239
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:35,400
that are built on on internet-based

240
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:37,589
products as that happened what really

241
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,660
drove the growth of Network we're not

242
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:41,430
people are places anymore because they

243
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,310
don't grow that fast

244
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:46,020
it was data data has an uncontrolled

245
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,510
growth it's really dependent it really

246
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,579
depends on what's producing it and how

247
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,370
we're consuming it it's not limited by

248
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:56,339
how fast people are born or how fast

249
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,080
civilization spreads so it had much

250
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,790
faster growth in fact many of us in this

251
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,350
room have lived through these early days

252
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,770
of many of these applications and many

253
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:07,080
of those many of us have been have

254
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,660
looked into dashboards where our traffic

255
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,870
doubled or more than drop doubled every

256
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,400
year that by the way was the real

257
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,820
inflection like if you if you look at it

258
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,010
right now

259
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,660
3 and 1/2 billion users actually it's

260
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,800
closer to four billion global Internet

261
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:24,900
users I am growing still you know

262
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,160
billion or to billions left all who are

263
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,020
not on the internet says it's going to

264
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,500
keep on growing 1 billion hours of

265
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:33,390
YouTube video watched every single day 2

266
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,390
billion plus monthly active Facebook

267
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,880
users I bike I believe it's going to and

268
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:39,839
half billion smartphones out there

269
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,760
average the internet connect connection

270
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,370
speed has gone up from 3 megabit per

271
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,400
second in 2007 to 20 megabit per second

272
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,200
in 2017 and if 5g actually happens and

273
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,730
it delivers everything that you want

274
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,570
it's going to be a few hundred megabit

275
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,830
per second for poor for all users right

276
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,660
so those of us who are looking at our

277
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,970
dashboards you know I remember very well

278
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:04,170
the early days of YouTube right and we

279
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:05,920
we looked an uncaught really scared with

280
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,680
this hockey stick growth

281
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,079
man you know a lightbulb went up like if

282
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,239
your demand is doubling every year or

283
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,219
it's faster than doubling every year

284
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,370
well moose law is just not going to keep

285
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,200
up your whole idea of scale out you

286
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,329
scale up doesn't really work because you

287
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,820
really can't wait for 18 months or two

288
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:26,769
years to get the next better capacity or

289
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,750
better speed interfaces on your on your

290
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,250
systems that you have right so at the

291
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,160
thing different but I think your friend

292
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:35,649
because we had no alternative there was

293
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,529
no other way of keeping up with the

294
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:41,410
scale and what has happened since then

295
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:43,630
is that you know ultimately where the

296
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,519
data gets gets generated has

297
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:47,589
significantly increased these are this

298
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,540
massive warehouse scale data centers and

299
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:50,889
the way they get consumed has

300
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,319
significantly scale which are

301
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:55,269
increasingly with Fuji and 5g handsets

302
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,970
and smartphones where people have

303
00:11:55,269 --> 00:12:00,459
ability to consume really high capacity

304
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:03,699
data or high bandwidth data into their

305
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:05,260
handsets everywhere in the world so the

306
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:08,319
need for the scaling keeps on going

307
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:11,740
keeps on growing and the answer that

308
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,709
many of us came came to and it happened

309
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,199
almost simultaneously in multiple places

310
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:19,649
was that we went back to an old way of

311
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:23,140
scaling Network which was called fabric

312
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:25,300
it started out in data center and then

313
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,850
increasingly it moved into other spaces

314
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,949
of the network in the case of Google

315
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,949
there are many generations of this

316
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:35,979
fabric that we have gone through called

317
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:38,680
5:07 Jupiter you must have heard of many

318
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,510
of those in Amin's keynote yesterday but

319
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,050
increasingly we took that same concept

320
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:46,329
and we move them to our one before which

321
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,339
is our Sdn one is built with the exact

322
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:50,019
same concept and increasingly to an

323
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:53,170
Internet age espresso which was the

324
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:55,060
other Sdn that that that we did also

325
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:58,180
uses the same concept of the link fabric

326
00:12:55,060 --> 00:13:00,069
or or scanning the infrastructure the

327
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,660
property that that this architecture

328
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:04,930
really has once you start thinking about

329
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:07,420
it is that it scales the number of

330
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,149
element in this architecture scales with

331
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,399
the demand growth very different from

332
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:16,540
Scylla where it was more or less static

333
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:19,750
over time right when that happens you

334
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:21,219
realize very quickly that I really can

335
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,250
not operate the censorship say the same

336
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,080
way because I don't have enough skilled

337
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,580
network operators out there in the world

338
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,340
to scale with the demand that I'm

339
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:33,490
dealing with so I can't really treat my

340
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:36,070
network as pets I need to start treating

341
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:38,370
this as cattle I I have to manage the

342
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,990
fabric and not the elements themselves

343
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,330
the other thing that happens which is a

344
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:46,240
property of scaling of any systems is

345
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,930
that the number of failure events that

346
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,000
you're going to see in your

347
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,609
infrastructure is almost linear scale of

348
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,100
the number of elements that you have so

349
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,740
while you solve the problem of scaling

350
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,020
with demand growth you inherited this

351
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:02,560
new problem that now stuff breaks more

352
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:04,600
often so let's go to a very simple sort

353
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,670
of very simple example of this right and

354
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,530
you know it's sort of interesting to put

355
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,560
this in perspective as to how often

356
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,480
these failures can happen so take a very

357
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:17,020
reliable switch that you can buy from

358
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,000
the market same MTBF of 30 years if you

359
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:20,530
had one of that in your wiring closet

360
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,390
this thing is basically not going to

361
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:25,180
fail you can have you know your whole

362
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:28,360
network on that for a good good good

363
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,880
lifetime right so I've building a fabric

364
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,230
with thousand of those and if you do the

365
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,060
math you'll find that one of your

366
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,550
switches are going to fail every week

367
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,900
statistically it's not - every week but

368
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,150
statistically you're going to see one

369
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,709
failure every week with the most

370
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,290
reliable such as that you can buy in the

371
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:46,630
market now think of one of the switch

372
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:49,150
which has maybe 24 ports 24 ports of

373
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:52,930
10-gig or 100 Gig or 400 gig right and

374
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:54,280
you buy the absolute most reliable

375
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,349
optics that you can find in the

376
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,920
marketplace let's say it has an MTF of

377
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:02,950
50 years like one of those it's never

378
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,800
going to fail do the math and you're

379
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:09,390
going to find that every day you're

380
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:12,010
going to see one failure in your fabric

381
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:13,780
this is sort of what you know Hussain

382
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,540
was talking about that statistically

383
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,760
insignificant becomes a real thing when

384
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,140
you're dealing with a large number and

385
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,550
scale-out has this exact property

386
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,770
because in scale out because you're

387
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:26,740
throwing number that the problem of

388
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:28,360
scaling you inherit all these challenges

389
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,700
with reliability that comes with that

390
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,529
and you start realizing very quickly

391
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,269
that there is no way that I can offer

392
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:37,639
this network in the classic way of

393
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:40,459
dealing with unreliability of system I

394
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,860
have to think my whole architecture that

395
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:44,899
essentially assumes that my parts are

396
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,579
unreliable but I'm going to build a

397
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,620
reliable system with unreliable parts

398
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:50,508
and the only way to do that is really

399
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,120
software so this is really the genesis

400
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:56,600
of Sdn right the reason that Sdn

401
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,670
happened was not because some of us were

402
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,589
sitting in a room and said wouldn't it

403
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,449
be really cool to run software outside

404
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:04,430
of the of the boxes that was not the

405
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:06,620
genesis at all the reason that it

406
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,138
happened was because we had no other way

407
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,850
of managing the system at scale that was

408
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:12,139
the only option that we found at least

409
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,120
at the time right so that was the

410
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:15,529
genesis of how HTN happen at least in

411
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,209
Google but I but I've had the same

412
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:19,009
conversation with many of you and I

413
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:23,359
always hear very similar stories as to

414
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:25,309
how we ended up there now if you

415
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,899
followed that strain of thought and if

416
00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:29,449
you came to the same conclusion that we

417
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:31,129
did at the time that you know look if

418
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:33,709
we're really going to run the system it

419
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:35,509
has to be run by software then few of

420
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:37,219
the other design principles just follows

421
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:38,839
through and there's of the logical fall

422
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,720
through of that conclusion that you came

423
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:43,459
to right the first one is if I'm going

424
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,740
to build a common software to run the

425
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:47,930
system the underlying elements must look

426
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,459
the same from software perspective they

427
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,050
can look totally different from hardware

428
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:53,540
perspective but from software

429
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:55,420
perspective they must look the same so

430
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:58,029
they must be built with around the same

431
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:01,849
software system that you run on them

432
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:03,649
they must have well-defined api's and

433
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,390
well-defined data models so you can

434
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:06,770
change the elements underneath without

435
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,929
having to change the whole software

436
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,520
system that manage them it becomes

437
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,350
critically important that you actually

438
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,869
have well-defined api's in your model

439
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:16,039
that there are not vendor specific or

440
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:18,139
that are not implementation specific

441
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:20,780
that actually can span vendor or

442
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,579
implementation it must be programmable

443
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,470
at every layer why is that important

444
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,168
that is important because you know this

445
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,610
is the first time in in how we have been

446
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:31,970
thinking about networking at that point

447
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:34,219
in time where we realize that you cannot

448
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,590
really have reliability by essentially

449
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,720
planning for a certain failure your

450
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,908
system has to react to failure modes

451
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,549
that you may or may not have seen in the

452
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:45,530
infrastructure and your response to all

453
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,260
of those failure has to be your ability

454
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,950
to program at

455
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,720
right layer of the system so if you are

456
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,820
trying to recover from something where

457
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,070
you know a couple of milliseconds of

458
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:59,040
packet packet black folding is a problem

459
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:00,720
then you can't address that by just

460
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,850
programming the management plane because

461
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,049
management plane is not fast enough you

462
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,240
need the ability to program the data

463
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:08,879
plane but if you're responding to

464
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,040
something where it is a security breach

465
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,559
that has happened because of failure

466
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,940
because of a wrong at all push you don't

467
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,230
need to touch the data plane you can do

468
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,780
that just by programming the management

469
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,190
plane but it is important that you have

470
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,260
a valid used to program all of them and

471
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:24,870
the underlying system must offer them

472
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:28,110
off of that right that is what I

473
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,629
ultimately view as the definition of Sdn

474
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,639
that the systems that allow probability

475
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:35,370
and every layer that has community finds

476
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,410
defined api's and in a model and there

477
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,030
are clear separations of control data

478
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,940
and management plan so we actually can

479
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:43,830
reason about what we program and when we

480
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,540
program it right so that's that sort of

481
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:50,939
my definition of Sdn the other thing

482
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:53,520
that comes into play in this world is

483
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,490
that this big change that happened from

484
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,139
scale up to scale out where we all of a

485
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,700
sudden are dealing with this explosion

486
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,880
of new elements that are coming in to

487
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,650
the infrastructure with with capacity

488
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,870
any one of you who run a large

489
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:09,860
infrastructure I'm sure you have come to

490
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:13,500
the same conclusion that I have which is

491
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:16,559
operation is really an optimization on

492
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:19,620
three axis it's a trade off its scale

493
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:23,220
reliability and efficiency and it's

494
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,928
reasonably easy to hit two or three and

495
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,850
you can go through examples right you

496
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:28,260
can you can buy two of them by the

497
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,620
spending more money but you won't get

498
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:34,860
efficiency as an example it is very very

499
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:36,989
hard to get all three of them and as

500
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,780
operator we strive to get all three of

501
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,070
them so what we realize in this scale up

502
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,750
the scale out is that you know what

503
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,540
really happened is that we traded off

504
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,160
capex with topics because in the old in

505
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,500
the olden world we had this large

506
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,750
chassis and and we could add you know we

507
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,669
could add more capacity but we're really

508
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,299
throwing capex at the problem in this

509
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:55,740
new world

510
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:58,620
you know nothing is free there is no

511
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,940
free lunch right so we actually can keep

512
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,139
on using this fabric for

513
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,389
longer period of time because we can

514
00:20:01,139 --> 00:20:05,879
skill them out we can add more elements

515
00:20:03,389 --> 00:20:07,110
in there but the price that he pays that

516
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:08,908
all of a sudden our operation cost has

517
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,809
gone up in the form of more failure you

518
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:12,240
know more things that you have to manage

519
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:16,139
more repairs and more people that we

520
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,600
need to operate it so again the answer

521
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:21,479
that we found is that in this world the

522
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,899
only way to hit nonlinear scaling of

523
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,789
effects is by automating everything it

524
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:28,918
was not automating pieces of it it was

525
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:30,658
not automating you know the config

526
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,000
update or so on it was the whole

527
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:35,940
lifecycle it's the whole life cycle of

528
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,669
the system starts from planning goes all

529
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,409
the way to repair and and finally you

530
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:43,850
know removing the things from the

531
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:46,470
network automate the whole ecosystem

532
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,658
well it's also important just like Sdn

533
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,429
you know automation to us was not really

534
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:52,139
a choice it was a matter of survival

535
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:54,269
because we just couldn't keep up with

536
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:55,889
this infrastructure if we did not if we

537
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:58,309
did not grow up with this we'll go on

538
00:20:55,889 --> 00:21:01,168
with this approach so just like Sdn

539
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:03,960
Automation was sort of a necessity of

540
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:05,639
the day it was not because we're very

541
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,629
smart and we're thinking of very smart

542
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,250
architecture I mean there were a lot of

543
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:10,469
smart people that ultimately came up

544
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,299
with the answer but the answers were

545
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:16,230
driven by this problem that we were

546
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:19,049
trying to address so that brings me to

547
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:21,360
you know and that that that skill out

548
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:24,779
world has delivered lots of benefits to

549
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,879
us over a long period of time and we we

550
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:28,289
have evolved that architecture over over

551
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:30,090
many years you know it doesn't quite

552
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:32,970
look the same way as it as it looked

553
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,470
before but as we're doing this and as

554
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,210
were enjoying scanning this

555
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,159
infrastructure and actually innovating

556
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,590
quite a bit around software-defined

557
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,889
network and at every layer of networking

558
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:46,559
a poured inflection happened and it is

559
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:48,840
probably the largest infection since

560
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:53,789
internet that has happened to network or

561
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:56,209
any computer infrastructure in in you

562
00:21:53,789 --> 00:22:00,059
know carrier and that is called cloud

563
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:04,350
ultimately public cloud and increasingly

564
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:06,389
hybrid cloud change expectations on how

565
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:10,168
applications are built and how

566
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:12,959
applications are delivered increasingly

567
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:13,710
we use mission-critical consumer

568
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,149
applications

569
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,500
as mission-critical enterprise

570
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:18,629
applications that are delivered from

571
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,149
cloud like you know I'm sure I'm sure

572
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,970
many of you came here driving using

573
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:27,120
google map or or something similar Apple

574
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:29,549
map we do our bank transactions on our

575
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,469
payment on our phone increasing our

576
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:33,720
enterprise applications run everywhere

577
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:35,159
and uniformly at Google we have this

578
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,679
enterprise architecture that I called

579
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,360
beyond carp and the whole premise of

580
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,870
beyond carp is that a Google employee

581
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,760
can be on a laptop Google laptop and be

582
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,949
anywhere in the world in a cafeteria and

583
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,629
a hotel a conference like this or on an

584
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,340
enterprise network and they all have the

585
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,659
exact same enterprise experience without

586
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,129
having to do anything else

587
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:54,929
they don't dial in to a VPN they don't

588
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,799
do anything they just open up the laptop

589
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:59,399
and they get the same experience

590
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:01,440
everywhere else including security now

591
00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:04,379
if that's the expectation that all of us

592
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,970
have wait our infrastructure then we

593
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,539
also have an expectation there are other

594
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:12,779
applications work as lovely meeting SLA

595
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:15,570
with the same security everywhere right

596
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:18,059
so if you think through ultimately what

597
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:21,000
are the fundamental things that cloud of

598
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:23,879
any form public or hybrid cloud really

599
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,190
offer to us and how they change how we

600
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,750
write applications you'll find that

601
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,720
there are four characteristics that we

602
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:32,580
follow and interestingly those four

603
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,820
characteristics are the same that you

604
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:38,039
have in any infrastructure that you rely

605
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,830
on day in and day out they are

606
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:43,260
fungibility reliability security and

607
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,939
Ubiquiti and you'll find that you can

608
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:48,919
apply those same characteristics to

609
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,390
running water or electricity because any

610
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:53,429
infrastructure that you rely on for your

611
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,860
mission-critical applications must have

612
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:57,120
this behavior what does that really mean

613
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,860
funds ability like if I have an

614
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,860
application and whether the application

615
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:04,860
is running on my on-premise data center

616
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:06,299
or in one of the public clouds as a user

617
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,399
of that application I actually don't

618
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:10,889
care I want the exact same behavior from

619
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:12,469
the application so computer and storage

620
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:15,360
is really a fungible resource

621
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:18,120
reliability it must be there you know we

622
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,120
have grown to expect when I'm driving

623
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,418
weather here in US are

624
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,010
Mumbai in India or or Rio de Janeiro

625
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,660
Google map just works

626
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:29,879
we expect the

627
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,900
to be reliable wherever we're going it

628
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,940
must be secure

629
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,110
i meani we expect the owner using this

630
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,270
applications no matter where we are

631
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,560
they're secure and ubiquitous you know

632
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,120
because that's really what cloud does

633
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,370
right we actually expect to be good it

634
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,610
whatever we go now if you walk through

635
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:46,139
this architecture and if you think of

636
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:47,760
how do you deliver this this

637
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,200
characteristic so of course computing

638
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,000
storage architecture has a lot to do

639
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,250
with it but what we'll find is that

640
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,370
networking has an absolutely critical

641
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:58,740
role to play in this happening

642
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:00,810
fungibility when you are really using

643
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,030
compute and storage infrastructure on

644
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:05,940
prim or a frame or between multiple

645
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:07,560
clouds what makes this that possible is

646
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,880
high bandwidth and predictable latency

647
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,860
on your network

648
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,720
it could be inside your fabric or it

649
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,159
could be spanning on a hybrid cloud

650
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,930
infrastructure that's what ultimately

651
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:20,460
makes it possible that's why you can

652
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:23,370
pull a set of storage SSDs or a set of

653
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,710
CPUs or a set of GPUs and use them as

654
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:28,219
pou instead of allocating them for

655
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:31,380
specific tasks network makes that happen

656
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:34,950
reliability the best way that we found

657
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:37,170
to make things reliable is by breaking

658
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,610
things into self-contained availability

659
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,850
zone I don't mean talked about that

660
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:45,179
quite a bit yesterday what really allows

661
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,790
an application to take advantage of this

662
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,990
different availability zone is network

663
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:50,909
whether it is at the load balancing

664
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,350
layer or whether it is at the l3

665
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,940
connectivity layer or even l1

666
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:56,429
connectivity later ultimately network

667
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,350
allows your application to take

668
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,530
advantage of this increased availability

669
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,490
by breaking their internal abilities own

670
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:05,160
security it comes although from

671
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:07,290
visibility to containment to threat

672
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:10,530
mitigation if all your applications are

673
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:14,370
using your where that's the best place

674
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:16,320
to find really you know anomalous

675
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,179
behavior that you can detect by using

676
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,370
small techniques like machine learning

677
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,960
network allows you to do that and once

678
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,669
you have it you also have the abilities

679
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,110
to go and enforce rules on your

680
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:27,240
infrastructure or they resell for your

681
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:28,649
l7 it doesn't matter and of course

682
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,880
ubiquity you know that's the definition

683
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:35,100
of network right so it is clear that to

684
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,830
get to this new world of applications

685
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,840
where applications are cloud native

686
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,429
network has a very critical role to play

687
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,699
I often hear of

688
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:46,560
from people that oh when we do cloud

689
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,260
native applications we just so need

690
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,330
Network well it's the exact opposite you

691
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,160
need a network that allows you to be

692
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,840
cloud native you just may not see it

693
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,340
that's what I call invisible

694
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,470
infrastructure because it has all these

695
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:01,050
characteristics of offering you what you

696
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:03,180
need without having without you having

697
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,379
to really design it that way

698
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:09,360
because somebody else has done it for

699
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:11,370
you right interestingly in this world we

700
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,979
inherit all the good things that we

701
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:16,590
developed in networking - righto they're

702
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,970
all applicable but there are a few other

703
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,610
things that are very distinct that

704
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,110
happens in this era that was not the

705
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:25,080
case in networking - righto

706
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,189
the first one being if you're really

707
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,000
going to hit all these four

708
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,250
characteristics

709
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,130
you really cannot differentiate between

710
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:35,040
physical and virtual networking let me

711
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:37,470
give you an a concrete example so you

712
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,240
have our kubernetes cluster it could be

713
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,520
anthos it could be your own kubernetes

714
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:45,150
cluster that you run in your private

715
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:47,460
data center you also want the ability to

716
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:49,800
run some of your workload in public

717
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,540
cloud and you want them to move funds

718
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,409
ibly between the Santa and our friends

719
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,350
so if you start thinking about

720
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:57,030
networking on your on-prem cluster you

721
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:59,280
more than likely are running a physical

722
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:01,080
data center network it's probably

723
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,530
consist of switches and so on and you

724
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:06,780
have potentially Sdn that allows

725
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:08,550
policies and routing for the traffic

726
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,190
that is coming in and out of the solar

727
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:13,260
disk buster when you're running the same

728
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,940
thing on public cloud you are most

729
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,100
likely interacting with the VPC you have

730
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,350
equivalent characteristics in what

731
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,790
things things are doing but it's virtual

732
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:23,010
network it's not really feasible literal

733
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:25,710
at least you are not managing physical

734
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:28,620
network right if you want through

735
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,910
fungibility this network must look the

736
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,310
same as far as your applications are

737
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:33,510
concerned they must look about the same

738
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,649
right they cannot look very different

739
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,629
you know when it comes to load balancing

740
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:39,210
or firewall or or packet processing the

741
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,280
most of the same this was not a

742
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,330
requirement in the previous generation

743
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,430
of networking this is a very new

744
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,770
requirement right with that few other

745
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,750
things happen so not only is the line

746
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:51,660
between physical and virtual network

747
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:54,330
blurring the line between on-prem and

748
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,260
off plain network has blurred again if

749
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,730
you can use the same

750
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,720
sample you notice that on criminal

751
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:02,220
networks at the same thing mostly

752
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,230
happening across the board with things

753
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,120
like Estevan connecting to cloud and

754
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,500
really extending your on-prem network to

755
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,939
off prem right so they're they're

756
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,220
increasingly becoming the same thing and

757
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,690
the difference between public and

758
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,720
private network has pretty much

759
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:17,430
disappeared because you tend to use both

760
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,600
depending on where your applications are

761
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,640
and how you use it

762
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,919
if you trace any application that you

763
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,840
are tool it will rely on I can guarantee

764
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,400
you that it Traverse is some bit of

765
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,740
public network and some bit of private

766
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,870
network and for those applications to

767
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:34,680
work with SLA the whole thing must work

768
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:37,260
right pretty unique requirements on the

769
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:39,600
network that we're trying to build so

770
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,910
how do they address this there are few

771
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,439
again best practices that starts coming

772
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,330
out once you start reasoning about

773
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,680
network that way that really physical

774
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,240
and virtual are not two different things

775
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,280
like when you're going to talk about Sdn

776
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,630
we're not really talking about you know

777
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,680
a virtual infrastructure we might be

778
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:55,800
talking about physical infrastructure

779
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:58,830
and vice versa right so the first thing

780
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:02,010
that you realize very quickly is that my

781
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:04,770
network infrastructure must be really

782
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:06,780
disseminated when I'm talking about

783
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:10,230
packet processing or flow processing

784
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:12,300
whether it's in l3 or l7 that packet or

785
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:14,190
flow processing might be happening in a

786
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,169
network ASIC you're in a switch or

787
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,690
router or in a network interface card

788
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:21,030
somewhere in a server could be happening

789
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:25,500
in a CPU could be happening in a

790
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:28,980
hypervisor that's running in cloud they

791
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:31,980
all offer give or take the same function

792
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,930
the performance might be different so

793
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,950
when I write a network application the

794
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,450
rate worker application should be

795
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:38,490
reasoning about performance but not

796
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,960
about how they're processed underneath

797
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,270
that's the only thing that I should be

798
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,710
reasoning about right and the only way

799
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:46,379
that you really can do that is by

800
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:49,260
building a very clear abstraction layer

801
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:51,630
above this ordering plane this

802
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:54,510
abstraction layer must hide the

803
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:55,800
implementation details you know whether

804
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,110
it's physical or virtual from the

805
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:00,510
network applications that you run the

806
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:02,490
second thing that happens is that your

807
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:04,800
network applications must be very

808
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,780
modular and it actually used all the

809
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,340
best practices of cloud native software

810
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,889
development where ideally they're micro

811
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:14,189
vyses and the reason being those

812
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:17,130
applications may run on our network

813
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:19,830
devices switch or router or so on or

814
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,360
they could very well run on a public

815
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,770
cloud instance of her doing the same

816
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,299
thing like you could have a firewall

817
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,440
that is a physical farewell function or

818
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,720
it's a virtual firewall function

819
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,830
someplace else right so unless you have

820
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,010
written the application with this

821
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:34,230
assumption that it is it is not going to

822
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,760
run in this specific environment but it

823
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,230
can run in multiple environment you will

824
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,090
not get there right so it must be

825
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,490
modular and micro-service best and a

826
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:43,230
third it's with an extension of the

827
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:45,480
principle that we that we derived in

828
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:47,880
networking 2.0 the clear definitions of

829
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,130
api is and data model that gets kind of

830
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,260
true and increasingly you know those

831
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,940
those api's are applicable to both

832
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,039
physical devices but also virtual

833
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,409
instances of networking you know

834
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:01,799
examples like for in-plane API such as

835
00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:03,240
before or SCI control API such as gdb or

836
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:05,580
Sonic and management API

837
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:09,690
you know GNA my Geno I in a part of

838
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:12,570
Sonic right as an example right must

839
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:14,789
have clear API definitions and clear

840
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:16,649
data model at every layer of the network

841
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:19,559
if you're really going to build this

842
00:32:16,649 --> 00:32:21,539
applications that way right but then

843
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:24,240
another thing that starts happening in

844
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:26,039
in this world which is you know network

845
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,350
in you know one would argue that network

846
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:30,419
has often has always been open because

847
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:33,689
things have to connect right it depends

848
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:35,610
on your definition of open yes open

849
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,440
standard network network has followed

850
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:41,000
open standard for actually a long period

851
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,950
of time but increasingly you see use of

852
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,409
open source software open open api's

853
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:48,840
open data models and every layer of

854
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:51,270
network and the reason being that as we

855
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:54,870
start reasoning about disaggregating our

856
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:56,820
network implementations the places where

857
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,590
you need open definitions of things

858
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,779
api's and data models are not just

859
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:03,689
limited to the boundaries of a system at

860
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:06,539
which we which of centralization before

861
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:09,210
it is within the layers it is within the

862
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:11,039
layers of how I define a data plane you

863
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:11,880
know p4 and p4 runtime is a great

864
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,529
example of that

865
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,820
like I actually have a common way of

866
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:16,770
describing what a data plane does

867
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,840
respective of whether it runs in a

868
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:21,290
switch in a network interface card or in

869
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,899
software I have a common definition

870
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,780
how I configured these things a good

871
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:29,299
example is open conflict very close to

872
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:31,280
close to me you know some of us started

873
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:34,190
building this this concept many years

874
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:36,410
back and it's an example of where

875
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:38,690
ultimately it's it's describing the

876
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:40,250
behavior of a network function it

877
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:43,460
doesn't matter whether it's physical or

878
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:45,559
virtual it's equally applicable and then

879
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,030
more more interestingly you know

880
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:48,649
increasingly orchestration of this

881
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:50,510
network functions as I described you

882
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,580
know as you start writing these Network

883
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:55,429
functions as containerized

884
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:57,409
micro-services whether they're getting

885
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:58,790
orchestrated inside an appliance or

886
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:02,150
whether they're getting orchestrated in

887
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:04,100
a cloud increasingly we're using common

888
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:07,010
open source accessory like kubernetes

889
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:10,219
like it's sto lights are this mesh for

890
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:13,330
describing the network behavior so I

891
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:15,560
believe very strongly that

892
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:18,710
standardization is now happening in open

893
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,270
and it's happening in code open source

894
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:22,609
is the place for standardization now

895
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,929
happens and this is a journey that we're

896
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:25,549
just you know just starting and I

897
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:27,800
believe that you know this would be the

898
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,600
norm as we go into building network this

899
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,790
actually increases innovation velocity

900
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,409
for all of us but it also allows us to

901
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:35,359
start building from what our de facto

902
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:37,790
standards so we don't have to start

903
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:40,219
figuring out what specification that we

904
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:42,020
start with for an API or a data model or

905
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:44,830
an orchestration and so on right so I

906
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,830
believe that's going to happen

907
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,659
now the third bit that that is becoming

908
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,100
very interesting with networking

909
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,020
furanose so I talked about how

910
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,270
automation was quite important for

911
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,640
networking Toretto now if you walk

912
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:00,290
through the automation journey you know

913
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,500
I break it down into sort of five

914
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:05,509
distinct eras of automation of which we

915
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,000
started with human driven most of the

916
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:10,880
network was human driven work flow

917
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,850
driven was when we took our mops from

918
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,119
Ward dogs or you know our text files and

919
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:19,819
we turned them into Python codes many of

920
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,350
us have done it in the past that was the

921
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,750
first step towards automation we

922
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:26,690
automated pieces of workflows not really

923
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:28,580
life cycle right that that really

924
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:31,119
started happening in one dot or became

925
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:34,279
you know gathered pace into dot o

926
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,670
even driven is where we actually look

927
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,589
for

928
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:39,339
our high quality signal from the

929
00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:42,140
infrastructure itself mainly events and

930
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:44,480
start workflows based on what those

931
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,799
events are this become a norm again with

932
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,930
the scale-out Network - rohtul

933
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:49,490
architecture many of us have deployed

934
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:52,308
automation system that does exactly that

935
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:54,020
right but one of the interesting thing

936
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:57,920
that happens when your network is

937
00:35:54,020 --> 00:36:00,440
application led lot of the intelligence

938
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,510
that you gather as to how your

939
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,460
infrastructure is behaving is not in the

940
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:07,369
network layer but in the application

941
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:09,349
layer simple example you might have

942
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:10,880
packet drop on your and on your network

943
00:36:09,349 --> 00:36:13,369
layer you know some level of packet drop

944
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,530
you might have an application at a

945
00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:17,720
higher layer that is very tolerant to

946
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:19,549
packet drop and having that low level of

947
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,808
packet or might be completely fine for

948
00:36:19,549 --> 00:36:22,880
this infrastructure to work because it

949
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:24,950
does nothing to heart the SLA of the

950
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,260
application that you're running right so

951
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:29,089
if you try to build intelligence just

952
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,760
looking at the network layer behavior

953
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:33,200
you might be under optimizing or over or

954
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,970
over optimizing your network depending

955
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,520
on how which access you're optimizing it

956
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,930
in right so we have no option but to

957
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,099
look into this additional layer of

958
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,348
intelligence that comes from the

959
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:43,970
application layer now if you think hard

960
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:45,829
you know this is this is really a

961
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:48,200
violation of a seven layer principle

962
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:51,200
right but we now have compute that

963
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:53,899
actually can do that it has abilities to

964
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,210
consume this massive data make sense of

965
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,790
them and provide signals that are very

966
00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:01,700
actionable right and we see that

967
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:03,410
happening or starting to happen in in

968
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,930
network infrastructure I call a machine

969
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:08,029
driven so in machine driven you really

970
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:09,859
gather as much of information about how

971
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,470
your network is doing from Network and

972
00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:14,390
applications everywhere you get

973
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:17,390
interesting Network military information

974
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:19,670
you make sense of them by using smart

975
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:22,400
algorithms often time machine learning

976
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:24,549
and you create high quality signals that

977
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,380
are immediately actionable by software

978
00:37:24,549 --> 00:37:29,359
we build this Sdn called espresso where

979
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,950
lot of the intelligence that comes in

980
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,779
espresso actually comes from the

981
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:35,359
application layer behavior of how Google

982
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:38,329
services behave and we take this

983
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:40,250
behavior to create signals to ultimately

984
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:42,140
guide the network as to where this

985
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:45,200
traffic should egress or how a tunnel

986
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:47,240
should be formed or how how a repair

987
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,250
should be done because we we not only

988
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,140
gather a signal from the

989
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:53,500
we gather signal from all the layer

990
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:55,660
right that's machine driven I believe

991
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:58,240
that machine driven is a is a feature

992
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:00,160
for networking trio that we all must

993
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,620
think about developing and building if

994
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,480
you're not already thinking about but

995
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:05,740
once they go there then you start

996
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,510
thinking you know there are a lot more

997
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:09,910
complex systems then network in many

998
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:13,150
cases that actually have gone to this

999
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:15,730
exact same evolution you know if you if

1000
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:18,310
you use the car analogy right machine

1001
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:20,940
driven is cruise-control approximately

1002
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:23,230
right that the cars are at that point

1003
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:26,860
self-driving within a certain boundary

1004
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:30,280
right if cars can go to fully autonomous

1005
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:32,140
or if planes can be fully autonomous why

1006
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,330
wouldn't the network be fully autonomous

1007
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:37,000
isn't it the the standard progression or

1008
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:38,670
how the networks work and I very

1009
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,770
strongly believe that that is possible

1010
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:44,320
that there is nothing with network as a

1011
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:46,180
system that stops us from making it

1012
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,920
fully autonomous now it doesn't mean

1013
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,049
that every network will become fully

1014
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,970
autonomous because if you are going in

1015
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,530
the direction you have to start building

1016
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:57,129
the network from the scratch with that

1017
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:59,020
idea like many of us we have inherited

1018
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:01,810
legacy network where they were not built

1019
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,700
with automation in mind and you can't

1020
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:05,259
get there you can't get there because it

1021
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,049
doesn't have the right characteristics

1022
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:10,060
to automate them but if you start with

1023
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,890
the idea that my network is going to go

1024
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:14,860
after Nomos at some day where there will

1025
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:16,299
be no human that touches the network you

1026
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,830
would apply the design principles that

1027
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,620
we have been describing here right so

1028
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:22,779
one very important design principle that

1029
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:25,600
actually falls out if your goal is to

1030
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:28,120
build self-driving Network and I believe

1031
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,980
very strongly that if you are trying to

1032
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:32,670
make our whole network self-driving will

1033
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:35,290
fail we have to really pick a domain

1034
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:37,780
ideally a greenfield domain that you're

1035
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:39,400
newly building and we go off for that

1036
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,780
interning that best self-driving because

1037
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,030
you actually can't start with all these

1038
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,310
good principles you don't you don't try

1039
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:49,060
and force fit them after the fact right

1040
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:50,590
so one principle that comes up that

1041
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:53,470
comes out at least jumps out to me in

1042
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:55,810
doing self-driving network is intentive

1043
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:56,350
and networking so what does that really

1044
00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:00,400
mean

1045
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:01,750
so what really means is that I have the

1046
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,210
ability to complete

1047
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:07,750
they describe the intended state of the

1048
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:09,520
network in an object model and that

1049
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,930
object model is persistent

1050
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,270
that's the desired state of the network

1051
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:15,669
that's why the state of that that's

1052
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:19,810
where the the truth about the network

1053
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:22,090
actually exists an example of that we

1054
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:25,840
have built this model at Google we call

1055
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:28,270
it unified network model or UNM UNM is

1056
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:32,740
how we describe intent of our network

1057
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:34,390
what we expect the network to do not how

1058
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:38,770
it is ultimately implemented at the

1059
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:40,960
lower lower layer right if you are able

1060
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:43,300
to describe your network intent with an

1061
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:46,470
with an intent model then you can build

1062
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:50,890
a system that actually take that intent

1063
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:53,410
compiles it forces that into states that

1064
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:55,060
the network must inherit and actually

1065
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:57,250
has abilities to keep the network in

1066
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:58,690
that sit or always tries to get to take

1067
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:01,630
the network very close to that internet

1068
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:04,450
state in order to have this closed loop

1069
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:06,610
system you also need really high grain

1070
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:09,370
real time a high resolution telemetry

1071
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:11,170
from your network system and it really

1072
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:13,660
is possible the only way that you can do

1073
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:15,430
that is by having very high resolution

1074
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:18,879
swimming telemetry that always streams

1075
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:20,770
the state out from the network so you

1076
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,690
actually can reason about whether my

1077
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,340
network is in the internet state or it

1078
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:26,890
is deviating from the internet state and

1079
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:29,680
therefore I have to take actions so it

1080
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:31,180
has to be a closed-loop system and once

1081
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,669
you build a closed-loop system you

1082
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:36,250
actually can start making the reasoning

1083
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:38,470
about the system smarter and smarter now

1084
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,820
we have been able to build this

1085
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:42,390
closed-loop system but I would fully

1086
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:44,560
admit that word we're nowhere close to

1087
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:46,210
really getting to a self-driving Network

1088
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,830
it's absolutely a bow but we're nowhere

1089
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,630
close to getting a self-driving network

1090
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:51,130
but we actually have this closed loop

1091
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:53,320
system where you can describe the

1092
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:56,170
network with our intent we can compile

1093
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:58,120
the intent to turn them into states that

1094
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:00,910
we actually push the devices or the

1095
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:03,430
elements or the software we stream all

1096
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:05,890
of the state from that and then we can

1097
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:07,690
compare how the systems are and close

1098
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:11,170
the loop where it's necessary but it's

1099
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:12,580
not yet super smart with the systemic

1100
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:14,500
and they start thinking about ok if I

1101
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,430
have that and I have all this data that

1102
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,410
is coming in

1103
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:20,379
- including data from application-layer

1104
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:23,680
application letters I can easily start

1105
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:26,079
sewing from Lu based reasoning of the

1106
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,390
data to machine learning based reasoning

1107
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,740
of the data in some cases of the neural

1108
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:33,040
network in some cases it could be

1109
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:36,129
reinforced learning and most interesting

1110
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,680
is that no outage in your infrastructure

1111
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:40,960
should ever go to waste

1112
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,480
every outage is an opportunity to train

1113
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,420
the system to detect that next time

1114
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,359
around before it happens the holy grail

1115
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:52,780
of any infrastructure is ultimately

1116
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,759
getting MTTR to zero and the only way

1117
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:57,220
that you can get him to tier to zero is

1118
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,990
by doing predictive maintenance you have

1119
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,669
to predict that something is sort of

1120
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:03,220
happen and you have to remedy it before

1121
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:05,740
that outages happened that's the only

1122
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:07,839
way that you can ever get to an

1123
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:10,479
infrastructure that where very few

1124
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:13,058
failures happen and the reality is that

1125
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,059
you know it is not possible to do by

1126
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:17,680
humans because it takes us some amount

1127
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:20,200
of time to reason about that and by that

1128
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,990
time doubt it has grown right so it must

1129
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:25,480
be you know a fully automated system

1130
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:27,368
that actually goes both of this approach

1131
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,430
of our really maintaining the network

1132
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:32,290
state with intent there is one of a

1133
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:35,919
beautiful thing that falls out in this

1134
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:38,230
architecture so if you are able to

1135
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,839
describe your internet state in an

1136
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:43,390
object then you have abilities to

1137
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:46,180
validate that object before you compile

1138
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:49,420
and here ability is to roll back that

1139
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:52,480
object when things go wrong that also

1140
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,859
means that you you really reduce the

1141
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,480
probability of failure in this

1142
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:57,040
infrastructure it is never going to be

1143
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,829
zero we're always going to have bugs

1144
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,540
because every system has bumps but as a

1145
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:04,180
system design principle you're actually

1146
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:06,790
reducing the probability that your

1147
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:08,680
system is going to fail right so I

1148
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:10,619
believe very strongly that you know as

1149
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:14,890
we're going into this world of of

1150
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:18,040
application led networking we have to

1151
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:20,470
work for walk from the Sdn best approach

1152
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:25,720
to increasingly in turn driven Network

1153
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:27,500
and apply this this very powerful

1154
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:30,230
techniques that we have developed with

1155
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:35,780
machine learning and an automation in in

1156
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:39,860
there so in summary in networking feet

1157
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:42,020
are all increasingly the OSI 7 layer of

1158
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:44,900
client-server model of strict separation

1159
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:47,180
between layers they start to fall apart

1160
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,830
in fact you now have abilities to

1161
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,690
consume information from all the layers

1162
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:52,430
to make smart decisions whether those

1163
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:54,290
information are coming from your optical

1164
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:56,569
system that is showing large you know

1165
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,950
errors or it's coming from application

1166
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,590
layers where you're seeing our pieces

1167
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:02,629
not completing they are both there

1168
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:04,130
they're all useful information for you

1169
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:06,470
to reason about how the network is doing

1170
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:08,930
and make decision based on that that

1171
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:11,299
reasoning application our optimization

1172
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:13,220
of every layer is a norm and it doesn't

1173
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:15,380
matter which layer you're optimizing you

1174
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,509
might actually be Co optimizing multiple

1175
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,400
layers at the same time you might decide

1176
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:21,590
that you know this is best done at layer

1177
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,970
7 but that has a large enough aggregate

1178
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:25,670
that I should be doing at layer 1 and

1179
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:28,839
not layer 7 so increasingly we can think

1180
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:30,830
of them as a fully decoupled system

1181
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,870
supervised and reinforced machine

1182
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:34,880
learning is is going to be a norm I

1183
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:36,470
believe that if you look at other

1184
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,140
systems that has gone through the same

1185
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:41,870
steps off automation you know car is a

1186
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,160
great example supervised and and we in

1187
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:45,020
first machine learning is going to be a

1188
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,850
norm in in the way that we do control

1189
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:49,250
and management and design and automation

1190
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:51,350
and last but not the least you know I

1191
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:53,870
have I've had a lot of conversation with

1192
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:57,049
many of you you know through my career

1193
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:58,940
on how do we ensure that we are not only

1194
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:00,770
introducing all these technologies but

1195
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:03,290
we are able to operate them the right

1196
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:06,290
way and the ports that you take is that

1197
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:09,529
you absolutely need the knowledge of

1198
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:11,660
networking it's it's it's it's akin to

1199
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:14,120
saying that if you are flying a plane

1200
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:16,730
you must know how the plane work every

1201
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:19,430
pilot knows that but increasingly a

1202
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:22,910
large component of that work is actually

1203
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:24,770
running software so we need you know we

1204
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:26,600
need folks who actually know how to

1205
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:28,190
operate software systems but have the

1206
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,930
knowledge of networking so they can

1207
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:32,240
apply that as the lan software system

1208
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:33,830
and this is the world that we are

1209
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,310
already living in and i believe that

1210
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:38,730
this is the world that many of you would

1211
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:40,710
live in for quite so

1212
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:43,470
time to come before the next inflection

1213
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:45,270
it's us and I have no idea of what that

1214
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:48,569
next inflection is I'm very excited I'm

1215
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:49,950
waiting for it and with that I'm going

1216
00:46:48,570 --> 00:47:03,930
to open it up for questions thank you

1217
00:46:49,950 --> 00:47:07,310
very much questions all right thank you

1218
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:10,980
interesting talk Lois the Google Fiber

1219
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:12,090
it might be obvious to you what a why we

1220
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:15,480
need a high level

1221
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:17,280
sorry high-resolution telemetry but can

1222
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,270
we discuss that briefly

1223
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,100
so what scenarios would require that

1224
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:26,030
what would you miss if you don't have

1225
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:29,520
that and you said something about a

1226
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:30,840
stream of state are you streaming just

1227
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,440
events

1228
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:37,590
alerts or is it just a constant state

1229
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:39,480
yep kind of thing and what about the

1230
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:42,630
threshold monitoring how how would that

1231
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:45,180
play into this okay great question so

1232
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:48,390
the question is when we're streaming

1233
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:51,600
telemetry what do I actually mean mean

1234
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:54,089
water is streaming in ideal world you

1235
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,740
want to stream everything that happens

1236
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,150
to a network system in data plane and

1237
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:00,629
control plane and management plane

1238
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:03,869
impractical because you you may not have

1239
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:06,000
abilities to stream all of that out but

1240
00:48:03,869 --> 00:48:08,520
you want to get as close to that as

1241
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,780
possible which which also means certain

1242
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,790
things with how we design they're

1243
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:14,790
dropping systems right so if you if your

1244
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:17,279
goal is to stream as much of information

1245
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:18,750
as you can from data plan then you have

1246
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,340
to design data plan differently where

1247
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:22,080
you are not necessarily relying on

1248
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,940
pushing the packet up to the management

1249
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,890
layer to get it out right you need to

1250
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:28,410
ability to stream it out why do I need

1251
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:31,080
that you need that because when you

1252
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:34,170
start reasoning about the root cause of

1253
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:36,150
a failure and you want to react to the

1254
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:37,650
root cause of a failure you want very

1255
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:39,390
high resolution events I'll give you an

1256
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:43,500
example right

1257
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:45,060
we often grapple with this what we quote

1258
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,369
unquote call flapping that you see in

1259
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:48,840
our optical fiber and when you start

1260
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:50,400
looking into the details of what that

1261
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,910
flapping is you realize that they're not

1262
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,010
all

1263
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,990
same things and the reactions to them

1264
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:57,059
are not the same and you really find

1265
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:58,439
that out by really looking at the time

1266
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,030
resolution of the event how often they

1267
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,369
happen what is the frequency and so on

1268
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:04,260
and so forth if you don't have high

1269
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:06,450
resolution data you may already have

1270
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,980
masked that's all root cause before you

1271
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:10,379
before you have the ability used to go

1272
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,430
go get there so if you're really going

1273
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,140
to do that order a couple of things that

1274
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:15,419
we'll need you need a common way of

1275
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:17,190
streaming the data out in our case we

1276
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:19,289
use open convex trimming to actually do

1277
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:21,210
that because it allows us to take data

1278
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:23,490
plane as well as consultant state as you

1279
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:26,220
go out you need a collector that is able

1280
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:27,839
to take all this data and actually keep

1281
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,279
the data the historical data that you

1282
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:32,220
can then you know go back and and

1283
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:35,099
process as it as if later happens and

1284
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:36,930
finally you need a confluent system that

1285
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:39,150
actually can do real-time processing of

1286
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:42,210
the data so it can react to it right so

1287
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:44,579
you need this whole ecosystem in there

1288
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:48,450
which which we actually have half built

1289
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:50,579
in in the Google products electro your

1290
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:52,558
second question was I talked about how

1291
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:54,450
the intern system takes an intent and

1292
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,880
compiles network state and pushes that

1293
00:49:54,450 --> 00:50:00,029
into into the network I intentionally

1294
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:02,760
use the term state because that state

1295
00:50:00,029 --> 00:50:04,920
can be a piece of config you might

1296
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,480
decide to compile that into a piece of

1297
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:10,079
config that you push into a network

1298
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,180
device or that state could actually be a

1299
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:15,539
forwarding state that you push into a

1300
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:17,578
switch or a silicon or it can be

1301
00:50:15,539 --> 00:50:19,529
actually a sub intent that you push into

1302
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:20,789
a part of the infrastructure right so it

1303
00:50:19,529 --> 00:50:23,160
could be many things and that's why

1304
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:24,869
that's why I use the term state how

1305
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,640
durable that steadies it actually

1306
00:50:24,869 --> 00:50:31,619
depends on which layer you're pushing it

1307
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:34,078
to great question thank you I've got a

1308
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:35,460
question over here I'm trying to ask a

1309
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,980
question I asked yesterday and didn't

1310
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:39,930
quite is what happens about Google's

1311
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,940
network itself becoming a single point

1312
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:44,759
of failure so the guy yesterday talked

1313
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,020
about B for failing over - B - B - is

1314
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,000
internet based couldn't handle the

1315
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:50,309
traffic and we had chaos for several

1316
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
hours do you end up having to run a red

1317
00:50:50,309 --> 00:50:56,130
team blue team because even as Google's

1318
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,720
going to get bigger the public internet

1319
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:59,670
resources available to candle that

1320
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:02,730
failover are not getting bigger at that

1321
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:04,210
same size and if I look at now

1322
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:06,700
abstracting out from you

1323
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:08,920
Facebook AWS asher and a couple other

1324
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:11,109
big players if I look at the each of

1325
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,640
those as a single monolith with a single

1326
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:15,250
point of fit as a single point of

1327
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:18,250
failure if one of you goes down there's

1328
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:19,660
no place for it to fail over - yeah this

1329
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,890
concerns me I'm sure it concerns you

1330
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,020
bits how do you engineer for that

1331
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:26,170
problem you have a Sorcerer's Apprentice

1332
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:28,180
problem inside your network does the

1333
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:29,950
symptoms just simply you know 1/4 the

1334
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:33,279
internet disappear until we can fix it

1335
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:34,750
or is there up right right you know we

1336
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,790
have we've learned through our mistakes

1337
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:39,910
all four designs you know as I'm insured

1338
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:41,680
yesterday right and the the best

1339
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:45,040
principle that were applying in our

1340
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:47,830
designs is that we we are we are trying

1341
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:51,070
to rely on global system as little as

1342
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:53,470
possible and increasingly in the systems

1343
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:54,760
that I design and and possession and a

1344
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:55,868
change in approach over the years

1345
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,099
because you've learned from God I

1346
00:51:55,869 --> 00:51:59,950
learned from lessons right that way

1347
00:51:57,099 --> 00:52:02,770
increasingly design non global systems

1348
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:05,200
and where we have global system we

1349
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:08,050
design it in a way that when the global

1350
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:10,419
system fails the underlying non global

1351
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:12,430
systems can still operate they may not

1352
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:14,080
be as reliable sorry they may not be as

1353
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:16,000
optimal but they're very reliable right

1354
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,410
so I'll give you an actual example of

1355
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,010
this as we have done you know I don't

1356
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:22,299
know how in what details I mean went

1357
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:23,470
through the espresso architecture but

1358
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,330
that's a good example right in the

1359
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:27,790
espresso architecture we have this

1360
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:29,950
global optimization that allows you to

1361
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:33,490
optimize how traffic flows across the

1362
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:35,649
internet from Google out but we always

1363
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:37,060
build this assuming the bad centralized

1364
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:39,970
brain can fail at some point of time

1365
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:42,430
right so when it does fail it falls back

1366
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:44,049
into the regional brains that are not

1367
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:46,118
globally optimal but they're regionally

1368
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:47,830
optimum give or take right and those

1369
00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:49,660
regional brains can keep on operating

1370
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:51,940
independently of each other without

1371
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:53,710
relying on the global global failure

1372
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:55,780
then you have a third fallback and the

1373
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:58,240
third fallback is when even the regional

1374
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:00,780
brain fails we still have abilities so

1375
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:05,290
forward packet relying on baseline

1376
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:07,930
infrastructure like BGP nigp right to be

1377
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:09,580
very honest we're not fully done with

1378
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:11,020
really reasoning through all of our

1379
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,490
infrastructure while we know that there

1380
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:14,650
is nothing global left in the

1381
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:15,729
infrastructure but that's the design

1382
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:17,290
approach that are increasingly taking

1383
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,770
because yes I mean if there is one thing

1384
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:19,690
that

1385
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:24,610
me or I mean we lose our sleepover it's

1386
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:28,390
exactly what you described yeah Tony

1387
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:31,300
Tavor Comcast so your earlier remarks

1388
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:33,400
about the scale of the network

1389
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:35,940
you know things fail and so even if you

1390
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:38,980
have a low MBT if you multiply it it

1391
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:41,350
still means regular spate of failures

1392
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:43,180
and and what it think it generally

1393
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:46,089
breaks down to is you know faulty

1394
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:51,399
equipment hardware switchboards optics

1395
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:53,080
you know boards or fiber cuts so where

1396
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,570
you can automate the work around the

1397
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:57,490
mitigation quickly and that you know

1398
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:59,770
write your applications to adapt and all

1399
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:02,439
that stuff it still takes a human being

1400
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:04,930
to fix every single one of those so how

1401
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,940
does that scale yeah every single one

1402
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:08,830
you have to get a new a new device out

1403
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,390
there you have to go packs of fiber yep

1404
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:13,150
yep yep

1405
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:16,210
great question so historically worried

1406
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:19,150
of down is that we have had a single MPT

1407
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:20,620
our budget the MTT of budget was for you

1408
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:22,240
know if you have a faulty port go

1409
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:24,609
replace the faulty port that doesn't get

1410
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,779
your budget right the pulsar we're

1411
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:27,430
taking is that there are different

1412
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:30,550
entities that you reason about right

1413
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:31,779
that if your software software it's not

1414
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:33,130
always possible like you could have a

1415
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:35,200
massive fiber cut wire you know you

1416
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:38,050
don't have capacity right but in cases

1417
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:41,259
where software can move your traffic

1418
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:42,730
away from the failure then your MTTR for

1419
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:44,260
actually doing the physical replacement

1420
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:45,910
can be very long you know it's not in

1421
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:48,070
finite but it can be very long right

1422
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:51,250
it's not days it can be weeks now right

1423
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:53,350
so you don't necessarily need to need to

1424
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:54,670
schedule work the next day because it

1425
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:56,529
has failed because you know that your

1426
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:58,990
software has has risen the monitor and I

1427
00:54:56,530 --> 00:55:00,820
moved it out we we actually do that

1428
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:02,770
quite a bit like we we have done that

1429
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:05,410
with how I do RMA right we actually

1430
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:07,900
don't necessarily respond to you know a

1431
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:09,430
down port immediately because if

1432
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,830
physically with physical placement

1433
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:13,390
because we don't need to right we have

1434
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:15,279
but the only way that you can do that is

1435
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:17,440
when you can very clearly have budgets

1436
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,030
that are allocated to what is what is

1437
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,790
very fair time and what that does to

1438
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:24,190
availability right so I would walk back

1439
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:25,660
from what is my outage budget and then

1440
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,950
start allocating those budgets to these

1441
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:29,080
various things that I have to do and

1442
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:31,419
what you always try to do is we try to

1443
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:34,839
give as much budget back where

1444
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:40,029
El Cid software and ambassador design

1445
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:43,019
approach okay hey thank you great talk

1446
00:55:40,029 --> 00:55:45,640
and question is you've talked about

1447
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:46,689
intent driven networking and I think you

1448
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,308
all agree we need to move to this

1449
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:51,099
direction however with regard to

1450
00:55:48,309 --> 00:55:53,470
telemetry the station was you need to

1451
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:55,630
get as much selamat as you could looking

1452
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:57,700
at modern system with generate terabytes

1453
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:59,559
of data a day with telemetry where are

1454
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:01,868
with regard to intent driven telemetry

1455
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:03,910
if your intent object knows what your

1456
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:05,769
service should be it doesn't Hanson

1457
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:07,480
knows but telemetry you need in order to

1458
00:56:05,769 --> 00:56:09,808
validate that your operational state is

1459
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,230
something whose during tender state yeah

1460
00:56:09,809 --> 00:56:15,069
great question

1461
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:16,569
so at Google our configuration data

1462
00:56:15,069 --> 00:56:18,160
model and our telemetry data model is

1463
00:56:16,569 --> 00:56:19,450
exactly the same it's open contract

1464
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,149
because of exactly the reason that I

1465
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:23,558
described right we we're isn't about it

1466
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:25,960
very early on I think unease is

1467
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:28,539
somewhere on the audience and you know

1468
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:31,240
you can grab him for more of the

1469
00:56:28,539 --> 00:56:33,010
reasoning many times yes exactly right

1470
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:35,229
so it became pretty clear that your

1471
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:38,529
intent that you're pushing into an

1472
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:39,970
element is how you want to get your

1473
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:43,509
telemetry back so it's the same data

1474
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:45,368
model we have Abel it is to consume

1475
00:56:43,509 --> 00:56:48,369
telemetry at very high resolution now I

1476
00:56:45,369 --> 00:56:49,809
fully appreciate that that hasn't been

1477
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:51,369
the case with everybody because where

1478
00:56:49,809 --> 00:56:53,170
everybody has a cloud infrastructure

1479
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:55,029
that you can throw out the problem but

1480
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:56,619
what I would say is that you know

1481
00:56:55,029 --> 00:56:58,390
increasingly public cloud is making it

1482
00:56:56,619 --> 00:57:00,160
possible right and you see that with

1483
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:02,589
products that many of the vendors are

1484
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,450
building where where the telemetry

1485
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:06,400
system leverages public cloud to

1486
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:09,669
actually consume data at pretty high

1487
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,740
resolution so it has become more viable

1488
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:15,299
now than it was because that then it was

1489
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:17,319
for companies like Google and our peers

1490
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:19,119
we have the advantage of having a

1491
00:57:17,319 --> 00:57:20,529
computer infrastructure right so so we

1492
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:25,029
were able we have been able to do it for

1493
00:57:20,529 --> 00:57:27,640
a while thank you over there and they'll

1494
00:57:25,029 --> 00:57:29,740
come back watching Anthony Gervasi Gold

1495
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:33,339
molasses telecommunications

1496
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:37,629
you talked about building an intent

1497
00:57:33,339 --> 00:57:39,609
driven Network right have you published

1498
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:41,710
any case studies is there for those of

1499
00:57:39,609 --> 00:57:44,480
us who think that that's the dream and

1500
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:48,740
want to get there

1501
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:51,170
we start yeah so yes we actually have

1502
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:54,950
couple of papers that describes this you

1503
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:56,869
know we I would say the the one where we

1504
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:58,399
have the closest to description of an

1505
00:57:56,869 --> 00:58:00,290
architecture that is fully intend driven

1506
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,630
would be the espresso paper and so I

1507
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:04,880
would recommend you you read it but even

1508
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:09,200
before we bother you know what I found

1509
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:12,890
so it's like Sdn many of us landed into

1510
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:14,319
stn Without Really designing it with

1511
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:16,368
that much clarity from the beginning

1512
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:18,109
there was enough clarity in the best

1513
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:20,810
architecture but not like we and we knew

1514
00:58:18,109 --> 00:58:22,940
exactly how the best design of stna is

1515
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:24,140
right for many of us it's kind of the

1516
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:25,760
same thing happen with Indian driven

1517
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:28,009
Network we it sort of we reasoned about

1518
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,270
it and it makes sense that that's what

1519
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:31,329
architecture should be and it sort of

1520
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:33,980
landed in there by by building it right

1521
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:36,380
but looking back you know there is a

1522
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:39,140
great intent driven system that people

1523
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:41,180
use a lot right now that actually has a

1524
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:43,160
very crisp description of how it does it

1525
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:45,109
s called kubernetes so you should really

1526
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,450
read you know what kubernetes manna-fest

1527
00:58:45,109 --> 00:58:48,799
us and and how that how that really go

1528
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:50,660
ahead is manifest is the intent right

1529
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:53,900
and it's a closed-loop integral system

1530
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:56,450
all the design principles that are used

1531
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:58,339
in kubernetes are the same design

1532
00:58:56,450 --> 00:59:00,200
principle that we use in building

1533
00:58:58,339 --> 00:59:03,259
network and it's not it's not by

1534
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:04,640
accident because we really inherited a

1535
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:06,430
lot of the best practices that Borg

1536
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,660
which was the father of communities

1537
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:10,430
actually implemented in our

1538
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:11,990
infrastructure so so there are a lot of

1539
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:14,299
similarities but a but actually you know

1540
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:15,529
I I find that if you just write the

1541
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,760
Kouga if you just read the community's

1542
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:18,020
architecture you're going to find all

1543
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:22,339
these best practices there because

1544
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:26,450
they're implemented thank you sure RT RT

1545
00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:28,190
anger artists question is on the four

1546
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:29,660
attributes that you laid out for

1547
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:32,990
networking three dotto I'm calling

1548
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:36,049
itself just so I could remember the

1549
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:39,919
security ubiquity where do you think we

1550
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:43,040
are as a community and because if I look

1551
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,109
at 3.0 the bigger aspects of it seemed

1552
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:47,509
to be operations if you look at killer

1553
00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:49,759
or the killer app that you talked about

1554
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:52,310
in one dot or two dot other elements in

1555
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,319
the solutions that people provided that

1556
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:56,630
could be improved you went from what

1557
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:57,220
vendors did or what software could do in

1558
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:59,650
this

1559
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:02,259
it's very operational so there are

1560
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:04,359
aspects of this which people who build

1561
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:06,099
networks like yourself need to

1562
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:08,049
incorporate for networking three dawdle

1563
01:00:06,099 --> 01:00:09,819
to happen and then there are aspects

1564
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:13,180
which obviously then you rely on the

1565
01:00:09,819 --> 01:00:14,589
solution providers yep and there are

1566
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:16,509
being with that job I got my journey

1567
01:00:14,589 --> 01:00:19,049
point oh yeah great question Dorothy

1568
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:22,420
I would say we are if we look across the

1569
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:25,480
industry I would say we're in the early

1570
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:27,790
days and let me walk you through a

1571
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:31,750
couple of examples of why I say we're in

1572
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:33,730
the early days right in most cases when

1573
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:34,839
we write networking software you still

1574
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,640
have assumptions as to where the

1575
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:38,500
software runs you know many of you are

1576
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:41,279
actually trying to change that that

1577
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:44,530
model but it mostly still exists right

1578
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,240
so so it is it is not yet quite

1579
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:47,859
ubiquitous where you can say that you

1580
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,379
know I have this waste that ran on my

1581
01:00:47,859 --> 01:00:53,650
switch and or or router or firewall and

1582
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:55,900
I can reliably take that and put this on

1583
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:57,460
this edge cloud that I have that is a

1584
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:59,800
cumulative cluster in most cases it

1585
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:01,480
doesn't work right I mean most cases it

1586
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:05,170
doesn't work because we haven't built

1587
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:06,640
enough actual harm attic api's around

1588
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:08,470
how this applications are like what does

1589
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,720
it take for an application to run what

1590
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:12,129
about water is capable it is how does

1591
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,660
other things interact with those

1592
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,849
applications there isn't enough

1593
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:17,589
standardization on those for us you know

1594
01:01:15,849 --> 01:01:19,510
most of us and realizations are still at

1595
01:01:17,589 --> 01:01:20,770
the protocol international layer and not

1596
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:22,329
in the application international layer

1597
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:27,460
right so there is there is absolutely

1598
01:01:22,329 --> 01:01:29,890
gap security is still thought of as a

1599
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:32,020
separate thing in many cases right which

1600
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:34,060
i think is a mistake because in the

1601
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:35,890
olden days you know we looked at a calls

1602
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:37,390
and firewalls to land and so on right

1603
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:39,220
but the real thing with security

1604
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:40,118
ultimately is zero trust and actually

1605
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:41,770
knowing what's happening in your

1606
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:44,859
infrastructure and then and then

1607
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:48,130
reacting on it right network allows you

1608
01:01:44,859 --> 01:01:50,560
to do both and so are we thinking from

1609
01:01:48,130 --> 01:01:52,720
ground up to building security

1610
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:54,160
you know infrastructure where it's it's

1611
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:56,529
not an afterthought or it's not a

1612
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:58,390
separate product or if we're saying that

1613
01:01:56,530 --> 01:02:00,339
this is not to say that you don't have

1614
01:01:58,390 --> 01:02:02,650
products that are specific for security

1615
01:02:00,339 --> 01:02:04,210
you would but every piece of networking

1616
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:06,339
product must think of security which it

1617
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:07,589
doesn't necessarily do today like that

1618
01:02:06,339 --> 01:02:10,199
so that's another and

1619
01:02:07,589 --> 01:02:13,499
good for example and then the last bit

1620
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:17,160
that I would say doesn't always get as

1621
01:02:13,499 --> 01:02:19,109
much attention is you know automation

1622
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,368
we've come a long way to be very clear I

1623
01:02:19,109 --> 01:02:22,019
think and they're talking to dotto you

1624
01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:24,900
know in the last 10 years we've made a

1625
01:02:22,019 --> 01:02:27,718
lot of progress in building things for

1626
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:29,579
automation right but we still don't

1627
01:02:27,719 --> 01:02:31,589
build things for automations where

1628
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:33,119
assumptions is that not only are we

1629
01:02:31,589 --> 01:02:34,799
going to run this network but there is

1630
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:36,779
lifecycle management I'm going to the

1631
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:40,049
upgrades I'm going to do you know

1632
01:02:36,779 --> 01:02:42,269
repairs I'm going to do you know refresh

1633
01:02:40,049 --> 01:02:44,640
of things in our are those built into

1634
01:02:42,269 --> 01:02:46,919
the way that we are building automation

1635
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:48,569
API is on the elements right that then

1636
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:50,430
ultimately an operator starts building

1637
01:02:48,569 --> 01:02:52,140
with right so so say you know we're

1638
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:53,969
making progress we're going in the right

1639
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:55,410
direction I absolutely see technologies

1640
01:02:53,969 --> 01:02:57,989
that are starting to address some of

1641
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:59,308
those gaps but are still in pretty old

1642
01:02:57,989 --> 01:03:02,579
it is I'm going there

1643
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:07,349
thank you I think I'm out of time maybe

1644
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:12,449
the last one hi there Tom Daley of

1645
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:14,849
parsley so I think everyone in the room

1646
01:03:12,449 --> 01:03:17,670
should recognize the privileged place

1647
01:03:14,849 --> 01:03:21,719
that folks who hold content have because

1648
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:23,369
we terminate a portion of the connection

1649
01:03:21,719 --> 01:03:26,579
right that faces towards the client

1650
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:28,739
generally speaking and that gives us a

1651
01:03:26,579 --> 01:03:30,359
lot of access to very rich telemetry a

1652
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:35,009
lot of the basis of what your networking

1653
01:03:30,359 --> 01:03:39,269
3.0 thesis hinges on what advice would

1654
01:03:35,009 --> 01:03:43,619
you give to network operators or best

1655
01:03:39,269 --> 01:03:45,928
practices or concepts for engaging in

1656
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:50,910
the problem of information asymmetry

1657
01:03:45,929 --> 01:03:53,160
right in this situation because a a a

1658
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:57,479
carrier does not have that rich

1659
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:59,549
telemetry data to consume to optimize

1660
01:03:57,479 --> 01:04:02,459
their networks and ultimately help their

1661
01:03:59,549 --> 01:04:06,089
users so what opportunities in the

1662
01:04:02,459 --> 01:04:08,489
networking 3.0 framework exist for that

1663
01:04:06,089 --> 01:04:09,959
kind of maybe rich information sharing

1664
01:04:08,489 --> 01:04:12,329
or some other means that hasn't been

1665
01:04:09,959 --> 01:04:14,459
thought of to carry that engagement

1666
01:04:12,329 --> 01:04:16,289
beyond the autonomous system boundary

1667
01:04:14,459 --> 01:04:19,109
and through the entire end end yep

1668
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:21,470
actually it's a great question it said

1669
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:23,788
that very very close to my heart

1670
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:27,259
there are actually two aspects of this

1671
01:04:23,789 --> 01:04:30,869
question and both are important one is

1672
01:04:27,259 --> 01:04:32,640
content providers have a vantage point

1673
01:04:30,869 --> 01:04:35,279
that necessarily

1674
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:37,650
the service providers or the edge

1675
01:04:35,279 --> 01:04:40,319
providers have age connectivity

1676
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:42,180
providers flipside is also to write H

1677
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:44,099
providers have a vantage point you know

1678
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:46,440
how well a radio network is working and

1679
01:04:44,099 --> 01:04:49,730
how often somebody sells we change that

1680
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:52,079
content providers don't have and we have

1681
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:53,759
asymmetric information on both sides and

1682
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,880
we don't have great abilities to

1683
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:59,160
actually share information Google took a

1684
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,960
step sometimes back in in trying to

1685
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:02,910
address a thin sliver of that I actually

1686
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:04,410
would not claim you know it was as rich

1687
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:07,950
as what you're describing but we have

1688
01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:09,480
this this product this application

1689
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:12,118
called peering portal where when we

1690
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:15,180
appear with someone those peer gets very

1691
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:16,769
rich information on how the network is

1692
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:18,328
behaving against the Google content

1693
01:05:16,769 --> 01:05:20,160
their private information for those

1694
01:05:18,329 --> 01:05:21,809
peers but these would be telemetry that

1695
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,589
they would not otherwise have because

1696
01:05:21,809 --> 01:05:24,480
they don't have access to the

1697
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:26,700
application layer now the problem with

1698
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,769
that approach other that approaches is

1699
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:30,720
actually really liked by our partners

1700
01:05:28,769 --> 01:05:32,819
because they use it quite a bit in in

1701
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:35,009
making decisions the problem with that

1702
01:05:32,819 --> 01:05:36,869
approach is that you know it it still

1703
01:05:35,009 --> 01:05:38,460
doesn't define a common way of

1704
01:05:36,869 --> 01:05:41,460
exchanging those information right and

1705
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:43,249
one of the things that I I often you

1706
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:47,400
know talk to my team and think about

1707
01:05:43,249 --> 01:05:49,288
still the best between network

1708
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:52,970
infrastructure API that we have is BGP

1709
01:05:49,289 --> 01:05:55,589
and we have pushed BGP as far as we can

1710
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:58,680
but it's still not as rich as we want it

1711
01:05:55,589 --> 01:06:00,599
to be right and one of the reason that

1712
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:03,690
we probably should rethink that is

1713
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:06,119
because in when that was the richest API

1714
01:06:03,690 --> 01:06:08,339
that we had the endpoints of those API

1715
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:10,170
is used to be offers increasingly less

1716
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:11,430
or the case the endpoint of this API is

1717
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:13,019
our software even though they're

1718
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:14,970
speaking BGP so clearly they can have

1719
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:16,529
much better API than that but we're

1720
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:17,970
still limiting ourselves into what we

1721
01:06:16,529 --> 01:06:19,170
are so I think this is actually a rich

1722
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:21,359
area of work that we need to

1723
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:23,039
collectively think about because I don't

1724
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:24,779
believe we have the right API for the

1725
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:26,130
networks to talk to each other for

1726
01:06:24,779 --> 01:06:27,930
networking through ATO in front of our

1727
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:29,279
clothes right because we are still blind

1728
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:31,410
to how each other's infrastructure

1729
01:06:29,279 --> 01:06:33,450
working which is not optimal for any one

1730
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:35,200
of us it's a great question thank you

1731
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:38,029
thank you very much for your time

1732
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:40,439
and I have a have a great conference

1733
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:40,439
