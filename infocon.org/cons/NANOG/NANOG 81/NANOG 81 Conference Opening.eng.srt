uh we are virtual once again this is our

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,760
third virtual meeting

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,680
in a row fortunately

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,160
of course my sides aren't moving now um

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,120
sorry one sec

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,440
is moving

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,120
in case anybody wonders this is why we

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,559
pre-recorded most of the talks

12
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,079
this is why we record um

13
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,480
we uh have 742 registered attendees and

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,920
apparently those numbers are growing

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,039
rapidly this morning

16
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,879
when the reminder emails are going out

17
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,960
and advantage of virtual versus in

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,479
person no plane tickets

19
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,960
so you can join at the last minute i

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,600
hope

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,080
many of those are with us at this time

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,720
of those

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,760
um 610 were complementary

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,560
we have changed this each meeting trying

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,040
to

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,360
accommodate our population as best we

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,400
can

28
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,759
um we going virtual we've had

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,680
this is our third attempt at it uh

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,840
there's been a lot of positives today

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,560
there's no line for the coffee bar um

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,920
nobody's complaining about missing their

33
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,680
super bowl party in their neighborhood

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,799
we're not at blame for that at least and

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,360
um but most importantly we're getting

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,200
better at virtual meetings

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,320
making our platform more um accessible

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,479
for people that cannot travel

39
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,720
when we go back to in person and i think

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,119
that's including speakers how we have a

41
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,000
wider

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,720
variety of speakers and i hope these are

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,680
lessons learned

44
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,680
that we will carry forward in the years

45
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,799
to come when we

46
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,399
are go back to in-person meetings

47
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,840

just to say about sponsors in general

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,400
our

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,640

to survive

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,520

an in-person meeting at nanook 82. i i

95
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,120
recognize this as optimistic

96
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,040
um but the news is changing almost daily

97
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,159
in regards to vaccines and um

98
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,799
and the cdc guidelines so we are we're

99
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,599
monitoring

100
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,280
we will provide information to the

101
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,879
community as soon as anything's

104
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
we are we are doing our best to have an

105
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,959
in-person meeting when we can

106
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,160
i hope that will be in 2021 um if it

107
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,680

108
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,560
meetings

109
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,880
um the virtual meeting will continue to

110
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,840
be robust

111
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,040
regardless if we have an in person we

112
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
recognize that a good portion

113
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,160
of population may not be able to attend

114
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,440
we'll monitor cdc guidelines safety is

115
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
our number one concern for the community

116
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,520
we will not have a meeting if it's not

117
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,400

including the keynotes a couple of

127
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,280
panels and uh

128
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,320
one two lightning talks um

129
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,080
the peer review is done by the program

130
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,680
committee which is a group of currently

131
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,840
25 of us

132
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,759
who are selected from the uh from

133
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,120
netapp's members

134
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,199
um if you're interested in being in the

135
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,199
program committee this is a good time to

136
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,560
listen up because we are currently

137
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,000
accepting nominations

138
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,800

139
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,320
nominations are open

140
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,440
through tomorrow evening i believe um

141
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,960
you do need to be a member but joining

142
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,039
is easy so if you're actually

143
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,360
interested please go to our website and

144
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,160
uh

145
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,000
look it up or speak to any of the other

146
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,919
pc or board or staff members

147
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,759
um and let us know and we'll help guide

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,120
you through the process

149
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,560
um the program committee is

150
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,800
self-governing in that we elect our own

151
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,600
leadership

152
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,840
and make up our own rules um

153
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,240
we don't uh accept interference

154
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,720
from the board or from our sponsors or

155
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,400
pretty much anybody else other than

156
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,639
you the members as to what you want to

157
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,960
see during a meeting

158
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,600
so it's a good way to learn a lot about

159
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,400
the industry

160
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,680
and a good way to influence what

161
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,680
actually happens during these nano

162
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,280
programs next slide please

163
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,319
well we have a virtual chat feature this

164
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:18,720
time

165
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,240
which is so much the one we used last

166
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,440
time except this time it might even work

167
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,800
and then it doesn't scroll back on you

168
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,639
randomly um

169
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,120
there are three tabs the chat tab is to

170
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,440
talk to other attendees

171
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,840
about whatever you want the q a tab is

172
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,080
specifically to ask questions of the

173
