1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,440
[Music]

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,240
all right

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,400
uh we're here to talk about automation

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,160
with config deployment in my little

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,920
section of

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,080
nano81 and with that i'll jump into a

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,920
quick introduction of myself i'm ken

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,359
salenza i'm managing director and

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,560
network to code

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,400
i was your classic traditional network

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,920
engineer by day

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,560
quarter by night i was always the one uh

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,279
in the corner

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:26,720
you know you know having no one to kind

15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,640
of code with uh but i've been

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,679
kind of following that throughout my

17
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,920
career i converted to a full-time

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,800
network coordinator

19
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,399
back in 2016. and i've been in industry

20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,559
since 2000 when i joined the air force

21
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,600
uh in in it uh

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,840
from there went to a consulting company

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,960
then mckenzie

24
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,360
and finally here whenever it could so uh

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,600
one of the things i'll kind of hear

26
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,360
throughout the the community as people

27
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,039
get into automation is something roughly

28
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,920
around

29
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,520
automation is kind of the art of

30
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,399
deploying configuration right and

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,079
i really think this is the common

32
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,640
approach most people take as they're

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,640
getting into network automation

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,200
right and what i like to say about that

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,960
is that's kind of like saying

36
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,960
let's automate the fun part right

37
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
because you know let's face it the

38
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,920
configuration uh is the fun parts when

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,400
we

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,479
building devices deploying uh new

41
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,240
infrastructure and and really get into

42
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,320
the nitty-gritty of it

43
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,680
and they start looking at what they do

44
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,119
the average network engineer starts

45
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,880
looking what they do and they say well i

46
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,439
could figure

47
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,360
you know ipsec tunnels firewall rules

48
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,960
switch port configurations

49
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,799
and that must be where my time is spent

50
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,400
and there's certainly some

51
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,720
truth to that right so what they start

52
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,079
doing is building this

53
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,240
one-to-one mapping of like some

54
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,600
automation script something like you

55
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,759
know configure request tunnels or

56
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,280
deploy firewall rule you know some

57
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,439
playbook like that

58
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,439
and what they're looking one of the

59
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,479
things that ends up happening you have

60
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,600
this one-to-one mapping

61
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,079
a few variables that are set each time

62
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,840
uh as part of their kind of

63
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,479
uh their automation process right to

64
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,399
actually deploy configuration

65
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,320
but again i feel like this is the the

66
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,840
the fun part of it of actually

67
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,719
networking so

68
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,920
not that it's gonna you know be your

69
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,758
business driver but that

70
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,599
it is it's kind of cool and fun to you

71
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,520
know be a network engineer

72
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,800
and actually go and deploy these

73
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,200
configurations then they sit there and

74
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,520
say

75
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,400
why isn't anyone using my automation and

76
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,840
there's a whole plethora of reasons but

77
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,480
i'm gonna

78
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
kind of concentrate on the ones here

79
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,400
right so uh things you'll start hearing

80
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:26,800
is

81
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,480
well you know my change went almost an

82
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,239
hour and you only saved me a few minutes

83
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:30,720
so

84
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,160
i'll just go to the old school way out

85
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
just going to hand jam it with via cli

86
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,040
might change windows so short you know i

87
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,239
need to make sure everything works in

88
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:38,879
time

89
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,560
you know similarly they're going to say

90
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,440
you know if i'm going to make the

91
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,319
changes

92
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,920
i want to be the one to know what's

93
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
going to go into those configurations

94
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,680
i need to be i'm in control it's my

95
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,519
bottom line to be honest right

96
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,959
uh and then ultimately you know if

97
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,200
automation can't be run intended

98
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,440
i still need to verify everything myself

99
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,280
so great you deploy this configuration

100
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,599
but i'm still stuck verifying the the

101
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,440
entire process actually worked

102
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
and taking all the responsibility of

103
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,560
that

104
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,000
oh so what are some of the issues

105
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,319
with that kind of process right uh we'll

106
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,080
talk about this kind of decoration and

107
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,519
source of truth right and

108
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,120
we'll talk a fair amount about that

109
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,319
source true throughout this uh

110
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,599
presentation

111
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,400
right and a lot of time is spent getting

112
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,080
the quote-unquote correct data

113
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
for the create the uh the configuration

114
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,080
right and what do i mean by that if you

115
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,040
look at the the bottom

116
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,599
screen here you see in red you have a

117
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,879
key uh sorry

118
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,040
key value pair with the variables in red

119
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,480
these are the things that change from

120
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,920
each deployment process to each

121
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,760
deployment process right

122
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,360
the stadium is kept transactionally

123
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,599
meaning the engineer

124
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,560
has it runs it and that's it it'll exist

125
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,120
for the

126
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,959
the the length of that change window and

127
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,239
that's it no longer

128
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,879
it's not kept in a source or truth right

129
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,319
which becomes a problem

130
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,680
as you get further into your automation

131
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,200
journey because you have to keep doing

132
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
this you have to keep doing this

133
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,080
analysis each time right

134
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,120
and one of the reasons you have to keep

135
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,200
doing this now analysis

136
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,280
is where is your data stored sorted

137
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,720
spreadsheets and word documents and

138
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,760
databases

139
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,480
right but nobody actually trusts that

140
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,680
data

141
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,840
right what they try to trust they trust

142
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,519
the actual configuration on device

143
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,200
so they get the next tunnel they say

144
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,120
tunnel 135 is next available

145
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,798
but they still go and verify anyway

146
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,399
right spending all that time to begin

147
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,400
with

148
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,320
the other problem is this verification

149
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,840
problem often your pre and post

150
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,199
changes the there's a tremendous amount

151
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,080
of time spent

152
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,639
on defining what the the network is

153
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,280
healthy

154
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,120
right this takes a lot of institutional

155
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,479
knowledge and what i've noticed and kind

156
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,520
of work with a lot of different

157
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,479
customers

158
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,639
is that no two network engineers within

159
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,080
the same organization

160
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,880
team do it the same they may both run

161
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,160
exactly the same commands

162
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,240
and come to a different analysis on it

163
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,440
one city is a

164
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,040
route that they think should be in there

165
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,320
the other is not concerned about that

166
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,520
they're only concerned about the change

167
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,080
at hand

168
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,040
and they both can come to some

169
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,199
conclusion by and large people tend to

170
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:57,759
run

171
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,240
roughly roughly the same changes but

172
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,440
slightly different right

173
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,880
so they're actually all doing different

174
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
analysis and looking at the same

175
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,280
uh part of the the data and the

176
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,080
configuration

177
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,400
slightly different right but they have

178
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,600
to go through this this point in the

179
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,039
process

180
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,560
uh then there's the network management

181
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,720
aspect of it bringing devices

182
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,039
into and uh monitoring and inventory

183
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:19,759
systems

184
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,440
that kind of go along with the the

185
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,360
change management that happens

186
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,600
throughout the the various change

187
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,960
windows and changing

188
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
workflows that happen within a given

189
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,160
network environment

190
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,520
right so as we break down these issues

191
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,360
right this is why i see pre pretty

192
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,720
fairly consistently

193
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,840
throughout various different

194
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,160
organizations i'm working with

195
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,759
really there's a tremendous amount of

196
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,759
time to spend in curating data

197
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,520
the verification process takes you know

198
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,960
monitoring sometimes people

199
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,199
don't concern themselves about it but at

200
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,320
the end of the day i'm

201
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,919
fairly consistency the actual

202
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,400
configuration deployment process

203
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,720
tends to be one of these simpler or

204
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,520
sorry what are the

205
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,639
shorter processes in this whole uh chain

206
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,759
right so uh what

207
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,680
how do we kind of actually identify

208
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,199
where your time is going how did i come

209
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,560
up with this data

210
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,039
and uh one of the things i do often is

211
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,880
the workflow analysis can i work with

212
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,560
various different organizations

213
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,759
through a workflow discovery or

214
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,400
assessment process to understand what's

215
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,520
going on

216
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,240
with their uh with their automation

217
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,039
strategy

218
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,160
so why is this so important all right

219
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
uh one of the things i find pretty

220
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,600
universally is that

221
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,440
most organizations don't actually know

222
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,880
where their time is going

223
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,280
right they're not aware of what other

224
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,319
other groups are doing

225
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,400
the various cab review processes and

226
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,759
approvals that

227
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,960
are required for the entire uh system

228
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,560
the operations team isn't talking to the

229
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,000
networking team to understand

230
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,680
what data points they're getting the

231
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,360
architecture team defines

232
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,160
a a design and the engineering team

233
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,039
finds out that

234
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,960
it doesn't actually work so they go and

235
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,120
uh

236
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,120
develop the configurations in a way that

237
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,039
actually works for them

238
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,199
uh so what what should be tracked here

239
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,080
right

240
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,759
so these four data points of constantly

241
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,680
work with my customers to understand

242
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,560
is number of times a request happens

243
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,280
right so

244
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,919
weekly monthly yearlies you know one ten

245
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,520
dozen 100 times that these requests

246
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,240
happen

247
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,319
how much engineering time right actually

248
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,319
pecking away at the computer

249
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,560
uh the how long does it take the

250
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,479
customer of the requester for this to

251
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,360
happen

252
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,120
meaning uh if i put the request in a

253
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,240
monday is it expected the next day next

254
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,720
week

255
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,080
next month when am i actually going to

256
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,840
get that back and in there

257
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,800
what's the opportunity cost right so as

258
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,680
an example

259
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,000
uh if you sell market if you have a

260
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,440
market fee that you're selling

261
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,360
and you could immediately charge your

262
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,080
customer um

263
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,240
and you have to wait until the actual

264
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,919
networking team can get the change

265
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,000
window in and deploy the configuration

266
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,199
to actually start charging

267
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,160
there's real real money lost there right

268
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,919
so in this process what should you be

269
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:58,960
asking yourself

270
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,080
basically what you want to ask yourself

271
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,160
is what would i tell a new network

272
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,879
engineer

273
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,560
that's uh going to work in my

274
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,240
organization and you're really going to

275
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,440
concentrate on the

276
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,400
tedious uh changes that need to take

277
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,120
place

278
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,960
and you can't presume any institutional

279
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,039
knowledge so that engineer needs to be

280
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:15,919
trained up on

281
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,879
where to gather data where to uh how to

282
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,160
log into devices

283
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,319
how to identify which devices should be

284
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,360
logged in for this change

285
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
and in that process you can start

286
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,520
understanding your your workflow

287
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,879
but with all that said when i kind of

288
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,039
talked to the average networking team

289
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,320
i guess something that looks like this

290
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,760
right this is their first their first

291
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,240
take

292
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,479
the way they look at the world is uh

293
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,839
request comes in

294
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,320
i can figure i close requests right and

295
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,880
that's it

296
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,559
they really start discounting their own

297
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,000
work efforts right

298
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,480
uh they take uh they only take it

299
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,760
they're their own tasks

300
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,959
not the entire workflow the

301
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,120
consideration right

302
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
they're not considering a task so you

303
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,560
know put another way

304
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,160
don't do this right what you want to do

305
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,920
is something more like this

306
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,600
right really start understanding the

307
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,360
different tools systems groups that are

308
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,080
working

309
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,680
in there right this looks you know it

310
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,360
starts to look a lot better it starts to

311
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,880
show the complexity

312
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,959
of what your your networking groups are

313
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,320
actually doing right

314
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,959
but better yet let's start overlaying

315
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,720
how much time is required for these

316
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,920
various different test

317
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,880
tasks and what we start to see happening

318
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,600
here

319
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,320
is where the various where most the time

320
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,440
is taking place

321
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,640
and i don't want i'm not going to go

322
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,760
through all the various different steps

323
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,120
here but what i really want to

324
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,080
concentrate on is

325
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,399
the applied configuration step doesn't

326
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,320
take them that that much here 10 minutes

327
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,800
could

328
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,240
be very reasonable for a lot of these

329
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,920
requests just to paste in configurations

330
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,399
and

331
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,880
one to two or three devices right but

332
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,800
the pre-post validation data curation

333
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,600
steps

334
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,720
start taking a long time all right

335
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,519
so rather than take this deployment this

336
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,959
automation deployment process

337
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,120
of deploying configurations let's see if

338
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,399
we can start automating

339
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,000
the other aspects and the other tasks

340
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,160
that associated with it

341
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,320
all right so we'll start with the data

342
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,200
curation

343
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,240
step right uh

344
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,640
one of the strategies i see is uh to

345
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,160
limit the freeform fields from the

346
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,079
requester kind of work with your ipsm

347
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:08,720
team

348
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,920
uh what i see the the uh network and

349
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,880
teams doing

350
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,120
all across the board is taking data

351
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,040
ownership of all requests that come in

352
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,720
what i often see is an excel document

353
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,120
comes in with free form fields in there

354
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,200
and every field is not normalized not

355
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,160
filled out

356
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,560
one fqdn in one cell five subnets in the

357
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,600
next cell

358
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,839
two ips in excel and there's no kind of

359
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,519
you know rigid constraints on there

360
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,079
right so

361
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,120
really start uh working with your

362
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,320
customer

363
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,720
uh your requesters and and with the itsm

364
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,560
tool or whatever the requesting system

365
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,200
is

366
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,880
to to limit their options and to make

367
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,920
sure that data comes in as qualified

368
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,880
then to start

369
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,079
moving uh your your tunnel and your

370
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,519
channel assignments and whatever

371
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,399
get next type uh capabilities to a

372
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,519
programmatically

373
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,600
accessible attribute right a database a

374
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,360
net box get do sheet

375
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,640
it doesn't matter as long as you can

376
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
programmatically read and make updates

377
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,360
to this

378
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,880
uh to this uh document store uh or data

379
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,000
store i should say

380
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,399
you're fine the the tool is a little bit

381
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,279
less relevant

382
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,320
some tools are of course better than

383
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,000
others but that's just like the way it

384
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,880
goes

385
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,519
uh and then start to develop automation

386
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,440
to update the source of truth

387
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,320
for those next tunnels and subnets uh

388
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,959
and then

389
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,480
verify it right you want to actually go

390
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,000
to devices you're we're

391
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,360
more than likely you're not going to be

392
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,000
ready for to just say okay it grabbed it

393
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,200
from the source of truth

394
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,320
we're going to trust that it's going to

395
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,519
deploy you're still going to follow the

396
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,800
process of verifying

397
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,399
that those resources aren't there is

398
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,399
tunnel 135 actually used

399
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,279
yes or no and then to develop the

400
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,079
automation

401
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,880
to create the configuration snippets but

402
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,640
not to deploy them right there's a key

403
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,399
key delineation and what do we mean

404
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,160
there

405
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,839
uh something like this right where you

406
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,760
take qualified data

407
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,399
from a normalized data store database

408
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,920
git or something some you know json

409
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,360
schema force get

410
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,399
uh with a qualified ginger template and

411
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,120
your the

412
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,880
the output you're going to get is going

413
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,320
to be qualified right

414
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
good data in good data out garbage data

415
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,360
and coverage you

416
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,839
right and this is really a a roundabout

417
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:12,880
way in saying

418
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,360
the source of truth is the cornerstone

419
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,959
to network automation

420
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,519
i cannot stress this enough it is full

421
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,279
truly the the cornerstone to network

422
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,480
automation right

423
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,720
as you look at a system like this you

424
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,680
you can't

425
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,360
inter interject kind of bad

426
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,000
configuration if you follow this process

427
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,839
right there's no way to have an extra

428
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,600
character an extra configuration

429
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,279
uh into your template without going

430
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,639
through your ci system

431
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,079
your database is going to do scheme

432
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,160
enforcement right you can't get

433
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,560
this completely not normalized data

434
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,160
right

435
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,839
okay and if we go back now to our

436
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,440
workflow we start overlaying

437
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,760
the tests uh the automation that are

438
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,040
overtaking the

439
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,200
the previously manually tasked we end up

440
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,279
with something like this and you can see

441
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,920
that we are uh overtaking the the tasks

442
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,399
that

443
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,880
take uh a serious amount of engineering

444
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,560
time with a kind of simple

445
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,959
simple process here right and we'll get

446
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,320
into later how we kind of

447
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,680
stitch together the system but for now

448
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,279
we'll just kind of take it one time and

449
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,200
just imagine an engineer just typing in

450
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,320
python you know

451
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,720
whatever that pie right reserving tunnel

452
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,839
getting the subnets generating

453
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,959
configuration right

454
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,440
uh to be later manually copied over the

455
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,079
next part

456
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,160
the next step is the verification which

457
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,519
is kind of often the

458
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,920
pre and post checks right each engineer

459
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,680
has their own tests there's no steering

460
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,600
definition of healthy

461
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,079
there's no baseline between data that's

462
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,120
not snp

463
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,279
right often you know work with customers

464
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,480
have optic level

465
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,720
uh issues because that's not captured by

466
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,920
and large by smp

467
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,120
so they don't even know if it's healthy

468
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
before or after um

469
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,800
you know data is intended to change if

470
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,160
you're going to create a tunnel

471
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,519
it's going to be different and and you

472
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,360
know that's going to have 100 tunnels

473
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,519
before and 101 tunnels after

474
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,600
and this is going to uh you know when

475
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,120
you're doing your manual diffs between

476
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,600
them

477
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,880
it's going to make it uh you know kind

478
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,959
of hard to kind of you know see

479
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,720
what's changed because you wanted to

480
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,560
change and what changed your question

481
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,079
uh there was another there's another

482
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,279
issue that you didn't really about

483
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,720
realize

484
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,480
the the raw text that's in there with

485
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,839
all the timers and counters

486
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,600
make it nearly impossible to effectively

487
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,000
use diffs if you have an ospf

488
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,480
or you know the bgp tables that you're

489
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,120
kind of

490
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,519
reviewing with the the the constant tire

491
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,040
changes from the pre and posts and

492
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,240
trying to compare them

493
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,040
and try to pattern match one change that

494
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,519
might be

495
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,000
actually uh incorrect between the c of

496
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,440
diff diff data

497
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,199
it's nearly impossible to to do

498
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,639
effectively

499
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,560
uh and find there still needs to be this

500
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,320
evidence of change control that there's

501
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,519
a demonstration

502
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,160
of a pre healthiness and post

503
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,920
healthiness of the device

504
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,480
so what i suggest to really think

505
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,519
rethink how

506
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,440
uh pre and post change validations are

507
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,800
done right

508
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,639
get your data into structured data and

509
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,160
then query that

510
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
data right and what i mean by that could

511
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,279
be anything from

512
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,680
ensure all neighbors that are configured

513
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,560
are actually

514
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,639
up right and compare it to a healthy

515
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,160
state right

516
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
uh and then rerun all your checks each

517
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,600
time well if you're not running

518
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,880
individual commands

519
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,720
you can just sit there and say run these

520
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,480
five 10 20 30 different

521
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,360
you know validation to say this device

522
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,040
is healthy or these devices are healthy

523
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,399
because you're not actually mainly going

524
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,440
through and you're saying

525
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,360
define again it's healthy not against

526
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,880
this change it kind of

527
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
changes the way you think about it

528
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,480
because you have this

529
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,600
uh ability to kind of do more with

530
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,720
uh less actual engineering effort on it

531
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,800
right but you can see here you have all

532
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,160
the stability once you get into

533
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,040
structured data

534
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,079
you could start clearing this you could

535
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,440
sit there and say

536
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,759
i want to compare my rounding table the

537
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,800
amount of routes

538
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,959
but not the timers i don't that's not

539
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,000
interesting data to me

540
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,680
timers are going to change constantly so

541
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,040
i'm not going to query that part of it

542
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,399
i'm not going to look at that data to

543
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,519
understand anything

544
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,440
and it really removes that manual diff

545
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,959
review

546
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,399
which just isn't that effective we've

547
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,480
all done it we you know we've

548
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
all been there but and you do the best

549
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,160
job you can but you get to a point where

550
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,880
there's

551
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,279
just so much your eyes can you know uh

552
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,720
your eyes get so strained you're gonna

553
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,000
miss things right that's just the nature

554
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,800
of the piece

555
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,320
okay so now again we're gonna overlay

556
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,839
this on top of our

557
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,519
our workflow and see where the

558
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,279
automation task uh

559
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,920
is the the additional automation tasks

560
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,759
but right you know smack in the middle

561
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,000
there's this uh manually applied

562
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,040
configurations

563
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,519
right which is just fine it's great the

564
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,440
engineer is still in control of their

565
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,399
own destiny

566
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,920
they understand what's happening they

567
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,759
understand what's um

568
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,440
uh what they're actually pacing and what

569
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,959
they're taking control of

570
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,399
for uh their change window

571
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,480
another kind of component of this is

572
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,839
network management and some

573
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,199
organizations don't do this as

574
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,639
religiously as others

575
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,959
uh one of the reasons is because of this

576
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,320
exact process

577
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,720
right people tend to put things in the

578
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,079
maintenance mode forget to

579
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,600
bring them out bring it to inventory

580
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,959
management system forget to bring it and

581
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:55,920
bring it back you know bring it out of

582
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,160
the

583
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,079
inventory management system forget to

584
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,480
bring it back in and so forth right

585
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,800
and you end up with these dozens of uh

586
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,079
unanswered alarms

587
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,520
that people are now reacting because you

588
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,439
don't have the correct processes in

589
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,240
place for that basically right during

590
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,280
your change windows you're not

591
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,240
effectively

592
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,640
managing all that again another part

593
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,319
that's kind of primed for automation

594
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,160
right to sit there and say

595
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,319
start maintenance and maintenance take

596
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,599
my devices out of maintenance so it's

597
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,160
not

598
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,480
being monitored uh we're gonna expect uh

599
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,839
you know down you know

600
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,280
the links go up or down during this

601
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,679
change window and

602
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,799
that's great perfectly acceptable

603
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,400
so at this point you kind of look and

604
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,160
you sit there and say we still are

605
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,840
deploying configurations mainly

606
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,200
but we've automated most of the long

607
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,760
engineering tedious tasks of it getting

608
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,240
data

609
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,720
verifying stuff reviewing hundreds of

610
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,400
lines thousands of lines of operational

611
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,880
data

612
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,559
that kind of bring no value right the

613
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,799
whole point is to deploy to change

614
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,440
to get the new service right and that's

615
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,480
where the value is and

616
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,039
and that's where you can kind of uh keep

617
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,640
you know i'm making the recommendation

618
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,160
to especially as you can start to kind

619
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,720
of keep that mainly at first

620
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,160
not in all conditions but in a lot of

621
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,919
conditions i think it makes sense okay

622
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:08,240
so

623
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,120
final thoughts here um so what where are

624
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,240
the benefits

625
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,720
right uh you know the network engineer i

626
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,960
think this is a huge cultural benefit

627
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,440
right

628
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,640
you know we have this idea that all

629
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,840
network engineers are dinosaurs they

630
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,960
just want to go and see like

631
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,400
i think there's a cultural consideration

632
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,799
to really consider here uh

633
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,160
you know they need to be in control and

634
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,600
to understand what's happening and if it

635
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
goes into this black box block of this

636
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,280
they don't know what's happening right

637
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,960
they don't see what's going

638
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,120
on you allow the network engineer to

639
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,240
retain that

640
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,160
and to build trust into the automation

641
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,520
system when they see that

642
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,280
every time automation is building the

643
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,039
right configurations all they have to do

644
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:43,840
is kind of

645
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,000
blindly apply them all the operational

646
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,919
tasks all the data curation steps are

647
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,160
done and then you know a real huge

648
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,919
benefit here is automation can't be

649
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,280
blamed for the issues right

650
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,200
you don't have right level access you

651
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,640
don't need right level access for this

652
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,440
automation

653
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,640
right it didn't do anything the

654
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,880
engineers need to ultimately take

655
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,360
uh responsibility for the configurations

656
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,960
they're going to push

657
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,720
allows you to concentrate on tasks that

658
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,000
actually take the most time

659
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,840
when you do the actual workflow analysis

660
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
right it can actually it gets your

661
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,679
automation into production quicker

662
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,559
i would say both uh without deployment

663
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,480
as i'm saying and even with deployment

664
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,840
without deployment it's obvious

665
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,919
you shouldn't need to go as rigid of a

666
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,039
control system to

667
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,600
for a read-only account but even with if

668
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,720
there's such a

669
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,440
a a trust into the automation i believe

670
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,720
they can actually get into

671
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,960
uh your production systems quicker even

672
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,400
for configuration deployment which

673
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,720
of course you do want to get to uh it

674
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,160
helps to build out that source of truth

675
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,880
again

676
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,039
the source of truth is the cornerstone

677
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,080
for automation

678
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,000
and again you know just to kind of

679
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,280
re-hit on that point

680
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,200
allows automation to be introduced with

681
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,280
less pressure because there can't be

682
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,440
issues kind of associated with it

683
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
okay and then we're just going to take a

684
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,200
pause and just kind of re-look at this

685
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,520
the same process that we had before but

686
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,320
we look at it

687
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,200
within the automated world here right uh

688
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,640
so we can take this this process

689
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,159
you know four or five engineering hours

690
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,159
down to less than one right you can

691
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,840
start stitching together everything so

692
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,840
the service request ticket comes in

693
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,520
makes an api call to your automation

694
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,440
system which gathers all the resources

695
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,720
and verifies it

696
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,039
if all that works out well sends an api

697
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,799
call back to the ticking system no

698
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,400
engineer was kind of had to get involved

699
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,440
and sit there and say

700
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,080
here are the configurations uh here's

701
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,520
the qualified data

702
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,919
vars you know and and the plan for the

703
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,840
configuration to be deployed

704
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,600
you still have to go through your normal

705
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,360
change window schedule change

706
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,600
cad review process all that fun stuff

707
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,960
then the day of your change

708
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,520
you run your automation uh you're sorry

709
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,320
you run your pre

710
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
automation which does all your your

711
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,159
pre-checks your network monitoring your

712
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,919
move systems from network monitoring

713
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,320
and then the engineer has the time to do

714
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:48,960
uh

715
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,400
uh to actually mainly configure the

716
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,320
trade the the configurations which again

717
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,120
they got from

718
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,400
you know the one of the previous

719
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,320
automated steps

720
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,679
they know it's qualified it's coming

721
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,880
from a standardized digital template

722
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,080
standardized data

723
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,480
uh and and they know it's good to go and

724
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,640
they run their post validation steps

725
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,120
and then finally you can even have it

726
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,960
kick back off to close a ticket

727
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,559
with all the evidence that's in there

728
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,320
that says that this is a healthy device

729
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,880
after

730
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,200
the change healthy device before the

731
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,520
change here's the evidence here's the

732
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,720
uh text files or uh

733
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,000
or strings to to prove that and

734
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,919
that is my presentation thanks and now

735
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,120
you will be around to answer any

736
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,450
questions you may have from this

737
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,779
