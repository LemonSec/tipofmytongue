[Music]

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,279
hey good afternoon good morning good

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,880
evening wherever it is that you might be

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,040
listening uh this is a talk about road

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,799
deployment in the dns core

6
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,240
where i'm coming from with this my

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,519
name's ed lewis by the way i work for

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,520
icann i've had a long experience working

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,640
for registries

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,960
i've worked in all sorts of tlds out

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,640
there i've worked on dns protocol

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,600
development

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
and so on i've seen this i've seen a lot

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,760
of things get built and rolled out in

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,960
the past

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,720
now one of the interesting things about

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,558
this process is to look at

18
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,079
how operators adopt new technology

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,000
in the past there was assumption that

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,440
technology should just be adopted

21
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,040
because they are good things

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,640
however i've learned that a lot of times

23
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,160
if you look at how operators

24
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,680
treat a new technology it tells you a

25
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,360
lot about whether the technology really

26
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
is ready to go

27
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,320
uh or where what other improvements are

28
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,680
needed for it

29
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,840
so you know is it new technology ready

30
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,600
for operations it's not really yes or no

31
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,199
it's it's a sliding scale

32
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,879
and i'm going to look at one case of

33
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,480
this

34
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,840
now the talking we're going to look at

35
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,199
the adoption of route origin

36
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,319
attestations

37
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,840
which are part of the routing public key

38
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,520
infrastructure

39
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,000
these are used to protect routing the

40
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,680
routing system which many people are

41
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,080
probably

42
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,400
really familiar with from other talks

43
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,159
i'm looking at only the routes that are

44
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,040
leading towards

45
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,880
servers that are part of what we call

46
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,479
the dns core

47
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,759
and so from here i'm going to talk about

48
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,000
two things initially what is the dns

49
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,479
core

50
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,119
and what a row is the first because it's

51
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:27,600
a

52
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,439
small concept that i've been working

53
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,119
with by myself

54
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,880
the latter because i want to make sure

55
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,240
that you that

56
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,680
you see that i understand what i'm

57
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,880
talking about or maybe i've got the

58
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,159
wrong thing i just want to make sure

59
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,520
about that

60
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,399
so first the dns core it's this green

61
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,000
area on the on the slide which is the

62
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
top of the dns name space

63
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,360
it starts with the root zone it starts

64
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,680
with the tlds the top level domains

65
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,439
that we are familiar with that have the

66
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,720
names of everything in the internet

67
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
below them uh there's also

68
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,799
the address and routing parameters area

69
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,479
that has the reverse maps for

70
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,719
ipv4 under inadder and ipv6 under ip6

71
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,079
and there's some other structures that

72
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,680
are inside of here that i collect

73
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,479
together to be

74
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,119
to create what i call the dns core

75
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,239
outside of that is

76
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,000
everything else that really uses the

77
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,440
internet out there you're probably more

78
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,800
familiar with what's outside the core

79
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,120
than what's inside the core

80
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,280
now i'll i want to take one side step

81
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,200
here and say that in my talk

82
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
i'm going to talk about tlds and i'm

83
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
using the word tld in my talk sometimes

84
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,319
not exactly the correct way tlds we

85
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,319
generally think of the cctlds the the

86
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,519
jurisdictional based

87
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,080
or country code is what cc stands for

88
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
tld's out there

89
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,519
the generic the commercial tlds out

90
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,760
there i also throw in the reverse map

91
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,200
as part of that because they kind of

92
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,040
behave the same way

93
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
when it comes to the dns protocol itself

94
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,720
the protocol doesn't differentiate

95
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,440
between forward map and reverse map

96
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,120
and i like to keep these these all

97
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,640
together and i you know having worked

98
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,440
for an rar

99
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,920
having worked for forward domain name

100
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,360
registries in the past

101
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,840
it's the same technology we really need

102
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,680
the two to all work together

103
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,360
uh there's not really a divide except

104
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,800
that there is a divide in the mission

105
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,280
that they cover

106
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
so the uh the core what you know the

107
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,640
upper reach of the core i'll give you

108
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,239
some caveats about that because this

109
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:12,720
might

110
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,159
play into how you evaluate what i'm

111
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,879
saying here uh the space up above

112
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,000
tends to be pretty stable in the

113
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,120
membership uh tlds do come and go but

114
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,159
not not many a day every once in a while

115
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,319
they they they come and go

116
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,799
in the last couple years a few have been

117
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,840
pulled out

118
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,640
not a great amount but some the

119
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,159
operators of the in this area too have

120
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,000
the dns as their primary mission

121
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
the reason why they exist or in business

122
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,680
is because of the dns

123
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,280
so they kind of have to really give it

124
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,280
uh that's their top priority uh

125
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,760
operations or operational-wise and the

126
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,599
protocol the us protocol surprisingly is

127
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,840
that it's simplest in the in the core

128
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,560
it's not a very complicated area now

129
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,840
outside the core there are higher

130
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,680
traffic zones there are higher value

131
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,760
zones there's greater functionality

132
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,080
and there are zones that are really well

133
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,959
engineered i mean

134
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,640
it's the core is not special in certain

135
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,040
ways but it's an area that's good for

136
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,480
studying

137
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,200
uh quickly but the roas because i want

138
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,599
to

139
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,040
get on to the rest of the talk aroa is a

140
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,280
route origin which is the ip prefix

141
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,959
and the last hop asn that i get

142
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,320
information about

143
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,798
and the attestation signs that the the

144
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,160
combination of prefix

145
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,600
and orig and the origin asn are approved

146
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,240
by

147
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,520
whoever it is the ip prefix is

148
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,039
is is allocated to

149
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,880
so the question let's go back the

150
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,720
question is what is row is signing

151
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,560
happening in the dns core how much of it

152
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,360
is out there

153
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,280
that's a relatively new technology it's

154
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,880
how far we've gone along

155
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,639
if it's low deployment it's been a hard

156
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,160
sell if it's high it's been

157
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,280
it's probably solving an immediate need

158
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,440
now beyond just a simple number

159
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,120
evaluation i won't look at a patterns of

160
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,000
this

161
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,759
to see where it is you know if it's not

162
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,520
full you know what's going on how is it

163
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,919
being

164
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,320
deployed out there and i want to point

165
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,280
out too that

166
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,479
in as part of any kind of a security of

167
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,199
this kind

168
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,880
there's signing in validation and i'm

169
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,479
not talking about the validation end of

170
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,680
this i'm just talking about the signing

171
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,400
is the

172
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,000
are these uh statements available

173
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,560
my method is is pretty simple it i look

174
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,880
i create a census of the dns core i look

175
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,840
at everything that's in there

176
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,080
the zones that are there the zones use

177
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,680
name servers the name servers use

178
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,800
addresses

179
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,720
addresses have route originations

180
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,160
related to them

181
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,840
i get the latter mapping from team

182
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,160
comrie's ip to asm mapping service

183
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,720
that's my source for routing information

184
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,720
and whether or not there's a roa or not

185
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,080
a roa i get that from

186
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,199
a list published by the ripe ncc

187
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,960
uh which just has a list of everything

188
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,320
that's been validated i had

189
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
my percentages are yes divided by yes

190
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,840
plus no

191
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,360
pretty simple calculation so

192
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,759
after a lot of this work uh putting

193
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,479
stuff together

194
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,319
i came up i come up with this uh pie

195
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,919
chart which is

196
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,120
uh current as of 24th of january and it

197
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,840
shows that

198
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,800
just a bit more than one in four routes

199
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,160
leading to the dns core

200
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,800
are covered by arowa and to give you

201
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,759
some more uh

202
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,919
orientation to what my calculations are

203
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,120
coming from

204
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,360
i have some numbers on on the right hand

205
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
side of the screen

206
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,520
the number of zones is 3000 or so that

207
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,039
includes all the tlds plus their

208
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,479
substructures

209
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,520
uh there are about 1774 tlds and again

210
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,039
that that's counting the

211
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,800
1500 or so forward map tlds plus

212
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,520
reverse map zones in there and so on a

213
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,440
few others

214
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,759
there are only 4 300 name servers

215
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,120
involved because there's a lot of

216
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,080
sharing

217
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,680
though for all those zones all those

218
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,720
tlds they only use 4 300 name servers

219
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,199
and there's only about 7 000 addresses

220
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,639
meaning that many name servers are

221
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,479
sharing the same address

222
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,160
and below that route origins there there

223
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,080
are much fewer only about 2 000 total

224
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,880
there's a lot of

225
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,840
sharing of a co-mingling of services you

226
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,280
go down the stack so to speak here

227
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,599
now looking i have about five months of

228
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,400
data

229
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,720
in this particular uh measurement system

230
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,520
i built

231
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,280
and i was able to go back to see that on

232
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,880
the left hand side you see a chart which

233
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,440
shows a pretty steady growth from

234
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,560
uh from the from august of 2020 to

235
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,199
now on the right hand side there's

236
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,000
another chart

237
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,960
which is actually the same chart uh the

238
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,160
difference is the scale

239
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,080
and one is showing that from 22 to 25

240
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,400
it's going up but from zero to 100 it's

241
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,599
kind of flat

242
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,599
and so it's going up but it's taking

243
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,039
some time to get there

244
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,280
and we're gonna see at this rate if i

245
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,199
just took that line out and be nine or

246
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,479
ten more years till we get to full

247
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,919
deployment

248
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,240
now one number is not enough here um i

249
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
will look at some other categories that

250
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,800
are out there

251
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
uh ipv4 versus ipv6 is one of the

252
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,720
categories that we usually look at

253
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,800
routing information and then we'll look

254
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,400
into the dns core that we have the

255
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,039
cctles the gtlds reverse map

256
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,120
as individuals and maybe there's some

257
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
other way to divide this up

258
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,960
what i'm looking for here is what are

259
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,160
the decision points

260
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,479
in the architecture where you might want

261
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,520
to address

262
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,560
what needs to be done to the protocol so

263
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,000
v4 versus v6

264
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
um they're pretty similar uh it used to

265
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,639
be that ipv4 or v6 would be different

266
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,440
because of the

267
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,720
the experience we had with these two

268
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,879
protocols and largely it's not

269
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,319
much of a difference anymore it's just

270
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,919
like a three percent difference between

271
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:24,800
the two

272
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,599
uh between 24 and a half percent and 28

273
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,160
25

274
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,680
7.5 rather but in doing this chart um

275
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,440
i was wondering why the numbers were

276
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,958
just off a little bit because i look at

277
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,200
my accounts and they're different

278
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,799
and being that when i'm writing my

279
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,320
software and you know i'm not that good

280
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,958
at it

281
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,399
sometimes i make mistakes but in this

282
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,080
case here

283
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,920
what stands out is the number of tlds

284
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,519
there are 1774 tlds counted for v4

285
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,959
but just 19 less for v6 and i went back

286
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:53,360
and i

287
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,959
trolled through some data out there and

288
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,320
i found out that's true that there are

289
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,600
about 19

290
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,080
of the ipv 19 tlds out there that still

291
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
don't have ipv6 servers out there which

292
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,800
is

293
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,680
uh surprising to me um but not part of

294
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,880
what i was studying here but i just

295
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,279
thought that was interesting

296
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,720
so if i look at now the zones by what

297
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,800
where we categorize them at some level

298
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,839
gtlds have a very small sliver

299
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,800
of roa deployed out there very small

300
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,279
number

301
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,600
of routes are covered thirteen percent

302
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,519
cctld is about one-third are

303
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,680
and the reverse map they're two-thirds

304
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,360
and the reverse map uh

305
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,040
we're talking about the the places run

306
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,600
by the rars who have been promoting uh

307
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,480
the roa technology quite a bit so it's

308
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,080
not surprising to see

309
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,040
kind of a much higher uh adoption it

310
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,800
with reverse map than in other places

311
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,000
so uh looking at this i mean there's a

312
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,279
couple of things that were surprising to

313
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,560
me because i do know

314
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,399
a lot about how the tlds all work

315
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,000
together uh there

316
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,320
there are a lot of cctlds and gtlds that

317
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,040
are run

318
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,880
off the same platform so they should be

319
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,399
together and now we expect numbers to be

320
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,200
closer

321
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,399
but still there's quite a bit of

322
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,720
difference out there in the reverse map

323
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,680
there's there is actually one

324
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,680
organization that's gtld cctl is in

325
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,640
reverse map all together but only one

326
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,440
but we have all these different

327
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,560
configurations we have different

328
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,920
agreements out there

329
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,839
uh trying to find out where things are

330
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,640
decided regarding the deployment of

331
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,200
routing technology and who needs to be

332
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,120
who needs to be pleased to roll this out

333
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,480
or can have where the concerns have come

334
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,120
from

335
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,240
are kind of all over the place so

336
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,560
taking a look at what i have understood

337
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,240
to be the way things are put together

338
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,880
we have the stack up on top registries

339
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,480
have a policy you know who's allowed to

340
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,680
list their names in my

341
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,160
dot whatever tld out there and that's

342
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,600
the registry administration takes care

343
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,040
of that stuff and there's a front end to

344
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,160
a database

345
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,920
the registry database is something run

346
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,360
by an organization um

347
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,760
and it produces whatever mapping

348
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,200
whatever they want to do with the

349
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,360
registry out there they have the we call

350
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,959
the who is data comes out of that the

351
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,560
rdap data comes out of that

352
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,360
but we have the dns is part of is one of

353
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,440
the products the dns and dns sect comes

354
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,800
out of that

355
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,880
then we come down to dns server hosting

356
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,240
now that kind of stuff generally is done

357
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,640
by

358
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,000
a dns operator the largest one out there

359
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,600
holds the largest one in terms of number

360
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,320
of tlds is around 250 and i call those

361
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,760
dns houses

362
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,279
are there a couple clumps of these out

363
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,720
there and i don't have details much in

364
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,000
the slides to keep this

365
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,519
in time for for the talk now below that

366
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,680
uh there's server hosting that's another

367
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,959
layer people who

368
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,680
run servers for other people and there

369
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,279
are up to 600 tlds in

370
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,040
one of these what i call a s houses an

371
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,320
as house might be the

372
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,720
might be the wrong name uh but it's it's

373
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,920
basically a collection of the

374
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,600
atom system origins that seem to share

375
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:41,920
uh

376
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,040
that that have dns servers in them now

377
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,640
uh it's kind of surprising that the

378
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,079
largest one of these is much bigger than

379
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:48,800
largest dns

380
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,240
operator out there because there's some

381
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,000
co-mingling some research

382
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,279
some sharing of these services

383
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,920
it in some cases you actually do have

384
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,880
organizations that run

385
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,040
all three of these layers in other cases

386
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,880
you have organizations that only run the

387
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,720
top layer and they contract the bottom

388
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,040
two

389
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,120
out to other people and it's all mix of

390
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,880
these different things out there

391
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,399
but it's interesting to start to divide

392
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,079
things into this so

393
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,639
i spent some time uh deriving things

394
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,839
called dns houses and

395
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,120
dns house is data driven uh so i run a

396
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,880
program and it will go off and do this

397
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,760
by itself

398
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,519
it looks at two things it looks at

399
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,959
what's in the dns there's something

400
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,880
called the r name field of the of the

401
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,839
soa resource record the r name is

402
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:30,800
supposedly

403
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,160
uh the responsible identity of

404
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,000
who's running the dns who's created the

405
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,399
zone file now it's not guaranteed to be

406
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,079
accurate but turns out to be pretty

407
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,920
accurate in the dns core

408
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
the operators there have taken time to

409
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,160
put in a reasonable value there that can

410
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,600
tie things together

411
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,000
and also there's a technical contact

412
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,480
field in a registry for the root zone

413
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
uh managed through the inf functions web

414
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,920
you can get it through their website or

415
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,320
actually online uh and i can use those

416
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,360
two things together and

417
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,320
and weave a little uh web of connections

418
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,959
and

419
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,920
create buckets of who who's coming who's

420
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,120
cooperating

421
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,200
a bunch of tld or who's who's running a

422
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,120
bunch of tlds out there

423
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,920
now in doing this uh there are very few

424
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,120
there are very few

425
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,160
large houses uh for which large meaning

426
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,760
they have over 100 tlds out there

427
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,000
there's

428
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,839
a couple of them out there and there are

429
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,920
many single houses it's a typical long

430
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,760
tail we have many that only do one or

431
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,959
two tlds

432
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,399
now typically the large houses are the

433
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,839
commercial places the commercial

434
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,120
operators that have done

435
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,680
tlds in bulk the single houses tend to

436
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,920
be the cctlds that are running their own

437
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,880
systems for whatever reason they have

438
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,000
for whatever purpose they have

439
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,279
so i created i took my dns houses and i

440
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,720
bucketed

441
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,560
up all of the route information i have

442
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,839
in dns core

443
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,639
and i made this plot and this plot shows

444
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,880
on the bottom from zero to 100 percent

445
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,279
how far they've someone has rolled out

446
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,880
row i mean that if they're 100

447
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,279
column every route advertisement has a

448
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,639
row covering it

449
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,959
uh zero percent on the left-hand side

450
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,160
they haven't started

451
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,360
doing anything about it now the height

452
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,800
of the dot is how many tlds they run and

453
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,399
you put this out there and you see

454
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,800
pretty much nothing there's not a lot of

455
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,480
organizations a lot of dots basically

456
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,519
everything's down low

457
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,399
a lot of small bit players in the bottom

458
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,360
the big players stay

459
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,040
either zero 100 percent and there's not

460
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
a lot in the middle in fact

461
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,480
over the months that i've been

462
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,000
generating this chart there's a dot

463
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,279
right in the middle

464
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,399
i don't know if i can actually uh use my

465
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,279
marker here but right here

466
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,320
right here if you see that um

467
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,839
oops yes maybe you can't see it right in

468
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,000
the middle of this about a hundred

469
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,360
tlds up and 50 that dot just appeared

470
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,959
one time and i haven't figured out who

471
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:51,519
it is

472
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,320
uh so i don't think it has much there's

473
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,519
not a lot of statistical things to say

474
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,440
about that

475
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,199
so the as house a little more

476
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,040
complicated i've had to do some more

477
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,560
playing with network names

478
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,880
uh bgp prefixes imagine the parsing of

479
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,160
the network name that comes from the

480
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,480
team country listing from the rers

481
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
and some other debatable parsing rules

482
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,360
and one up that i create pools of as

483
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,600
numbers that may be running together

484
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,440
and one thing that's important here is

485
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,680
zone could be multiple as houses

486
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,000
and i do this chart here which again

487
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,360
doesn't seem to have a lot to it but

488
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,240
actually it seems to be a little bit

489
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,320
more organized

490
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,680
and i've used some colors here on

491
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,920
purpose here the green dots which are

492
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,480
all on the left side of the screen

493
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,160
are the large commercial operators

494
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,759
that's a subjective

495
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,480
application of that term by me these are

496
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,680
the ones that i've known for running

497
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,839
tlds for a very long time and they all

498
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,240
are staying low on the scale of adoption

499
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,759
one has got a little bit of the ways up

500
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,920
there but not very far

501
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
the red dots there you can see four of

502
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,600
them easily and there's actually a fifth

503
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
one that's visible if you look hard down

504
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,480
the bottom

505
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,040
those are the five rars and they are all

506
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,560
at 100 percent

507
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,199
now the you noticed earlier i had a pie

508
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,079
chart which showed

509
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,440
only two thirds of their routes are

510
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,759
covered the difference here is that's

511
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,120
two thirds of the routes to their

512
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,320
servers that they're running

513
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,199
further for their zones if you look at

514
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,399
just the routes to the

515
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,480
as numbers that they have allocated back

516
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,160
to themselves for their own business

517
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,000
they've done all of the road coverage

518
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,759
already sometimes they have some

519
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,240
some other they go to other sources for

520
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,199
uh

521
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,519
uh ho server hosting that haven't

522
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,639
covered their uh

523
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,600
their routes now the orange dot is a

524
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,480
special uh

525
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,800
one-off it's not it's not a special one

526
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,000
it's a special unique

527
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,759
organization which has no tlds they

528
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,639
don't run any dna they don't run

529
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,120
a registry but they uh they offer

530
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
services to many many many tlds and

531
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,639
they're significant in their size for

532
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:45,120
that

533
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,880
but also they're trying to push

534
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,759
sometimes the technology further

535
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,160
now this next chart is a blow up of the

536
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,600
lowest part of this this

537
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,120
only the small the the 50 tld uh

538
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,600
players or less and you see the other

539
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
red dot that's there is that last rar

540
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,839
that wasn't too visible before

541
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,520
and there's a slight organization from

542
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
low to high as you go left to right but

543
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,199
nothing much i would really uh

544
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,480
make a conclusion about so uh

545
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,640
overall judgment um overall statements

546
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,319
ro's are sparse

547
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,640
there's not a lot of data here a large

548
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,880
non-rr hosters as houses have low

549
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,679
deployment

550
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,679
but the large r hosters that are that

551
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,240
are the large hosters that are not rer's

552
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,720
i'm sorry the large rar hosters do have

553
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,000
high deployment so

554
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,679
the last two bolts there kind of show a

555
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,520
contrast in uh who's

556
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,080
rolled it out uh there's an inherent

557
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,280
risk of adding security to an

558
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,799
in-operation system

559
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,720
uh this is just a background slide to

560
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,799
why a slow adoption may

561
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,960
actually be uh going on here that we

562
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,160
don't try

563
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,960
to uh put if you were to put security

564
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,640
into a system that's very critical and

565
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,840
the securities of itself

566
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,720
has a an issue there will be chaos so we

567
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,440
look for communications for this

568
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,400
now i've had experience with dns sec dns

569
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,720
sec is also similar because it was a

570
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,280
up post operational application of

571
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,960
security to an operating system out

572
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,160
there that if it broke it it would be

573
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,280
really bad

574
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
adoption of dnsk has taken a very long

575
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,559
time in over the

576
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,080
two decades since it started being

577
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,919
rolled out it's only pretty much

578
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,520
respectable or visible and

579
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,760
depending on how you look at this uh

580
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,440
it's actually been a good thing it's

581
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,799
been slow given some of the early

582
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,240
hiccups that happened

583
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,919
uh currently though dnsx sees a

584
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,520
different adoption pattern

585
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,559
within the dns core itself in the dns

586
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,880
core dns core the large operators have

587
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,080
fully deployed it

588
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,679
and what remains to be deployed are in

589
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,000
the single cctld operator is kind of

590
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,679
a little bit different from what i see

591
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,039
with the roas

592
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,919
for who knows what reason so good

593
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,600
questions here uh

594
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,440
uh is it ready for deployment i'm going

595
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,880
to duck the question um

596
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,160
i don't want to speak on behalf of

597
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,240
operators explain why it hasn't been

598
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,720
rolled out if deployment ought to

599
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,440
progress

600
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,960
what needs to be done again i'm going to

601
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,559
duck that question because an operator

602
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,840
would be the best source for that

603
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,600
information

604
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,480
and so in wrap-up uh the this the work

605
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,520
that i've done here

606
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,960
it's merely checking the temperature of

607
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,360
the room uh is 25 acceptable for now

608
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,679
maybe maybe not are there possible

609
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,600
improvements for this to go forward and

610
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,280
is it a business case issue i've always

611
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,039
heard about the dns business case not

612
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,080
being made

613
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,240
um i think that it's probably very hard

614
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,280
to make that

615
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
now relying on my experience of dns sect

616
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,080
from 1990 since 1998 rather

617
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,000
slow adoption has advantages we've used

618
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,480
to have lots of bumps with dns second

619
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,080
because the pioneers were the only ones

620
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,760
involved in either the signing or the

621
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,880
validation

622
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,720
only the pioneers were they were willing

623
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,000
to smooth

624
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,400
over what we saw uh there are gaps that

625
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,160
still exist in dns sex some

626
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,000
still still need to be filled as we go

627
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,440
forward and

628
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,120
the other part of this too is that the

629
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,559
value proposition

630
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,400
may change over time if there was a time

631
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,320
when dnsec was not solving an immediate

632
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,200
problem

633
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,120
uh but that changed when people's uh

634
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,799
attitudes about that happen

635
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,760
so i hope i'm gonna end here and hope

636
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,120
that there may be some discussion or

637
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,480
questions about so maybe other people

638
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,679
will be interested in looking at

639
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,690
the topic down the road thanks

640
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,000
[Music]

641
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,280
we'll continue next with q a

642
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,400
edward what are ican's next stepped

643
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,919
steps with rpki other than research

644
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,200
when will we see a raw covering

645
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,240
the l root ip blocks

646
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,080
okay uh what is our what is there

647
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,120
besides research is that life

648
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,400
now i i really uh well what part of

649
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,840
icann's mission is to

650
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,280
basically coordinate communicate what's

651
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,039
going on out there so research

652
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,679
and observations are important to us and

653
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,159
uh

654
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,520
you know at some point it'd be good to

655
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,120
have a dashboard for this so you know

656
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,000
we're thinking about

657
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,720
what we can do to do some of these over

658
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,840
these studies over a longer

659
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,080
period of time but in terms of anything

660
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,360
else it's kind of beyond me

661
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,240
to uh really give a plan for what we

662
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,880
want to do in in terms of

663
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,039
the rpki and roha deployments out there

664
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,400
and in terms of the operational

665
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,280
questions

666
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,600
um that's actually not in my area of the

667
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,360
organization i'm going to deduct that

668
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,400
as a non-operator i can assure you that

669
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,520
the operators we have

670
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,720
are well aware of the technology

671
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,080
and they're doing their evaluations

672
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,240
they've tested it and

673
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,760
they are just evaluating whether or not

674
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,440
they want to when or when

675
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,480
or if to roll this out at some point

676
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,280
so i'll leave that

677
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,000
okay thanks uh another question that

678
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,440
came up is um

679
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,559
you're aware of uh detailed studies of

680
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,679
the implications

681
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,320
or or rpki of rpki on robustness

682
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,159
of the dns core can you comment on that

683
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,440
well it's there's a general uh a general

684
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,960
cat you know a general situation here

685
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,840
whenever you add

686
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,919
a security mechanism to an already

687
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,520
running system

688
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,880
you're you're changing things you're

689
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,480
making it a little bit more brittle at

690
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,559
times and we did it with dns sec

691
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,120
um in everything everything system when

692
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,200
we add on security later we're risking

693
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,600
the

694
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,799
original system's uh health

695
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,200
and so you want to go slowly with this

696
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,840
uh

697
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,000
and it's without being specific with

698
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,440
really detailed answers would take an

699
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,720
hour to explain

700
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,400
uh basically whenever you add on

701
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,760
security to something you want to make

702
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,320
sure

703
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,559
the security system itself doesn't cause

704
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,360
a failure

705
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,799
down the road you want to protect and

706
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,480
not destroy the system

707
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,440
it's it's running on

708
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,840
okay um

709
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,840
do you um we are unfortunately out of

710
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,720
time

711
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,320
um any uh final thoughts about uh

712
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,760
observations anything you would like to

713
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,559
share with the nano community

714
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,480
now just well just quickly uh i noticed

715
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,559
that susan fourney gave a statistic last

716
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,760
night or at the end of the session

717
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,960
yesterday where

718
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,280
uh she mentioned 25 was the adoption

719
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,720
there so i think that the measurements

720
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,679
have some uh

721
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,240
basis in reality they're spread further

722
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,120
than this

723
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,799
uh but in general i just want yeah i

724
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,480
want to take this as a

725
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
measure of you know it's not the

726
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,840
operators are slow to adopt something

727
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,600
but uppers may be reluctant to adopt

728
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,880
something we need to figure that out

729
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,039
before we decide there's business cases

730
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,559
promotion is needed or whether or not we

731
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,559
need to go further with developing the

732
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,760
system to make it

733
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,080
make sure that it is truly adding

734
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,520
insecurity and not

735
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,360
risking some of the performance we have

736
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,678
today

737
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,480
okay well edward thanks for joining us

738
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,840
today

739
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,080
you
