00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,440
[Music]

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,440
ipv6 turned 25

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,920
in december and for those of you who've

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,759
passed that milestone yourself

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,599
you probably remember your friends

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,200
saying wow

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,000
25 years that's a quarter of a century

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,680
that's a really long time

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,279
and you know it is kind of so i thought

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,920
it would be kind of fun on ipv6 25th

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,080
birthday to take a look at

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,119
how far it's come and that uh well

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,479
ipv6 might not be where the architects

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,160
thought it would be at this point

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,480
it certainly has come of age and it has

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,480
inserted itself firmly into the internet

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,239
so

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,719
let's start out by taking a trip down

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,000
ipv6 memory

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,600
lane the protocol uh began in december

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,320
officially

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,680
in december of 1995 when the rfcs

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,079
were released to propose it as a

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,719
solution to ipv4 address exhaustion

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,359
and the ipc rfc um 1881

26
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,000
was the address management allocation

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,040
and the rfc 1883 was the protocol

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,920
specification

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,240
and from that point ipv6 was off and

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,200
running

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,640
in 1999 apnic aaron and ripe

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,680
were allocated their first slash 23s so

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,840
that they could give users

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,439
ipv6 blocks microsoft added

35
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,080
ipv6 stacks to both of its operating

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,080
systems in 2001

37
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,759
and hurricane electric actually took

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,200
care took advantage of that

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,400
uh ability to get an ipv6 block in 2001

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,520
as well

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,040
in 2002 lac nick became the fourth rar

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,840
to get a slash

43
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,799
23. by 2003 sprint was deploying ipv6

44
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,600
and then apple had added ipv6 support to

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,439
its operating systems

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,640
in 2004 afrinic became the fifth and

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,119
final rar to get it slash 23 so now

48
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,320
every rir could

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,719
give ipv6 allocations to anybody who

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,920
wanted them

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,880
in 2007 hurricane electric converted

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,840
this network to

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,878
native ipv6 in uh 2008 the us government

54
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,080
announced that it was

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,200
ipv6 cable across all of its systems and

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,120
the european union also set the goal

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,480
for having all of its systems uh or 25

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,200
of its systems rather ipv6 capable by

59
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,440
2010

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,599
google search and maps were available

61
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,959
over ipv6

62
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,319
in 2009 and by 2012

63
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,080
we finally get to world ipv6 launch day

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,360
after 17 years on june 6th

65
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,360
trying to uh encourage ipv6 adoption and

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,920
then

67
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,879
in 2017 we got the official ietf uh

68
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,280
ratification of ipv6 as an internet

69
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,800
standard so

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,640
that's what that is where it's been in

71
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,840
25 years now

72
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,000
i thought that a talk on ipv6 was not

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,519
going to be complete unless we talked

74
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,760
about why it's not ipv5

75
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,000
and actually um for those of you who

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,159
know there is an ipv20

77
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,200
ipv5 it was known as the internet stream

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,480
protocol or st and it was designed for

79
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,080
connection oriented communications

80
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,519
across ipv net

81
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,200
across ipv networks but um ipv5 was

82
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,480
based on the 32-bit

83
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,080
address scheme so there was no way it

84
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,800
was going to be a successor to ipv4

85
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,840
but um the thing the concepts in st

86
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,959
are similar to um later asynchronous

87
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,560
transfer mode protocols

88
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,640
and con its concepts can be found in

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,280
mpos so it didn't exactly go away

90
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,680
but um that's the reason why it's ipv6

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,799
and not ipv

92
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,239
or ipv5 so

93
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,599
let's take a look at the ipv6 adoption

94
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,480
rate

95
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,519
um v6 has come a long way since it

96
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,640
debuted

97
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,280
and i thought i would look at how many

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,360
of the world's internet users are routed

99
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,760
over

100
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,840
ipv6 and what the ipv6 routing table

101
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,400
growth

102
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,120
looks like when you compare it to ipv4

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,760
and how

104
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,680
access to the internet is driving

105
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,200
adoption of ipv6 globally

106
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,040
so first we're going to start out by

107
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,879
looking at

108
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,640
the adoption rates over various

109
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,238
countries now there are

110
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,759
a couple hundred countries in the world

111
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,358
and this would be a very busy graph if i

112
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,880
put them all in there so i decided to

113
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,358
put

114
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,080
just the top 50. and you can see that uh

115
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,720
adoption

116
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,199
ranges from belgium which is a little

117
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,720
over 55

118
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,280
down to nepal which is about a little

119
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,240
over 12.

120
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,880
um and then everything in between you

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,600
can see it's

122
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,199
the it's kind of an eye chart and you

123
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,639
probably can't see all the countries

124
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,360
that are on here

125
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,880
but i thought it would be interesting to

126
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,560
point out the countries that weren't

127
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,800
which are russia and china which despite

128
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,560
having large populations of internet

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,199
users

130
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,479
do not have a high adoption rate of ipv6

131
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,160
let's look at the top 10 countries that

132
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,360
have adopted ipv6 belgium is in first

133
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,840
place

134
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,840
and when you think of belgium you

135
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
probably do not think of

136
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,400
ipv6 you probably think of waffles and

137
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,000
beer and maybe chocolate

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,919
but um it's not an accident that uh

139
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,400
belgium is on its first place

140
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,440
they have a very active ipv6 council and

141
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,960
they hadn't experienced an early

142
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
shortage of ipv4 addresses

143
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,440
so it was um with a country with 11

144
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,880
million people they had to do something

145
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,919
and they began

146
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,360
consistently topping the list of

147
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,720
countries that adopted ipv6

148
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,560
india is in second place and india also

149
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,120
is a country that had a lot of people

150
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,440
and not very many ip addresses

151
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,960
sci-fi technologies rolled up ipv6 in

152
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,360
2005.

153
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,639
so that's the reason why they're in

154
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,080
second place they've been using it for a

155
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,520
long time to cope with

156
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,400
ip shortages germany owes its place on

157
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
this list mostly to

158
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,120
aggressive deployments by its

159
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,479
isps both in mobile and uh

160
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,080
and wi-fi telecom malaysia same thing

161
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,199
mobile deployments

162
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,440
um greece another country you might not

163
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,800
have thought would be

164
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,000
on the top 10 but it has consistently

165
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,160
been in the top 10 uh countries

166
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,440
adopting ipv6 for the last five years

167
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,479
taiwan has uh also

168
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,080
is not a surprise it's a densely

169
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,160
populated country and it just

170
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,639
rolled out a large mobile deployment and

171
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,880
landline deployment with ipv6 so

172
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,319
that's the reason why the percentages

173
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,919
are so high there

174
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,800
vietnam has been uh steadily inching its

175
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,160
way into the top 10

176
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,919
for years it start finally made it to

177
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,039
top 10 in 2019 again mostly due to

178
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,880
mobile deployments

179
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,280
um the united states uh owes its

180
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,240
position on

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,000
on the chart mostly to uh isps like

182
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,199
uh like verizon in

183
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,120
and uh and comcast and at t

184
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,080
uh all who all right uh rolled out their

185
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,919
deployments either to their end users

186
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,520
their um uh residential networks or to

187
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,840
their mobile

188
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,000
luxembourg and switzerland uh are both

189
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,280
at about 44

190
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,319
and again a shortage of ip addresses and

191
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,000
aggressive deployments are how they got

192
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,520
there so

193
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,360
if we look at ipv6 growth over the

194
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,319
last decade um a route table growth of

195
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,759
the last decade

196
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,520
well let's start with ipv4 because we're

197
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,960
probably familiar with that um

198
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,720
in 2011 we had about 341 000 routes in

199
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,759
the ipv4

200
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,080
table and we're up to um like 860 or so

201
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,520
um beginning of 2021 and so that's you

202
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,880
know quite a bit of growth over the last

203
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,240
decade a lot of routes and i think

204
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,160
before everybody knows that

205
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,240
so let's look at how ipv6 is done now uh

206
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,759
it started a little more modestly in

207
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,280
2011 with

208
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,800
4 200 routes and actually in its

209
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,000
when it was having its birthday in

210
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,400
december it also passed 100 000 routes

211
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,639
that was a big milestone for ipv6

212
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,400
so at this point there's about a hundred

213
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,479
and five thousand routes in the table

214
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,840
and you can see from the growth curve it

215
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,520
looks you know that says pretty good

216
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,800
good growth curve

217
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,240
so then i thought well that's what

218
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,759
happens when i just pop those two

219
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,639
together and

220
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,199
you know then um ibv6 doesn't look like

221
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,000
it's doing as well

222
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,560
as ipv4 um it looks kind of small but

223
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,039
uh you know is it really let's look at

224
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,960
the percentages instead

225
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,199
so if we look at the percentage growth

226
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,160
per year

227
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,520
it kind of tells a little bit of a

228
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,000
different story you can see that

229
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,919
um it had quite a large percentage group

230
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,240
the first year of almost 85 percent

231
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,479
but the ipv's four table has been

232
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,080
growing between

233
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,440
5 and 15 over the last decade whereas

234
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,479
the ipv6 table has been had at least 25

235
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,399
percent growth every single year over

236
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,920
the last decade

237
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,320
and to really bring home what that means

238
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,519
if we show that

239
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,920
year-over-year percentage increases of

240
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,200
ipv6

241
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
now you can see how this really has

242
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
grown and it kind of turns the table

243
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,200
on that other graph we have 388

244
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,760
of uh growth over the last decade in

245
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,440
ipv6

246
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,640
versus about 97 ipv4

247
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,560
so i know what you're thinking you're

248
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,800
probably saying susan

249
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,640
yes you know this is you know a lot of

250
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
growth but you know it took

251
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,320
ipv6 25 years to get to 100 000 routes

252
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,399
well does anybody out there remember how

253
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,720
long it took ipv4 to get to 100

254
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,000
000 rounds well i do

255
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,959
it happened in 2001. now remember ipv4

256
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,000
was released to the public in 1981

257
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,839
so that means it took ipv4 20 years

258
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,399
to get to 100 000 routes and remember

259
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,320
from our little trip down memory lane

260
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,519
ipv6 didn't even get released to the

261
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,519
rir's until 1999

262
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,880
which means that it took about 21 years

263
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,080
for ipv6 to get uh to get to 100 000

264
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,640
routes

265
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,080
so that's not really that different

266
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,600
between the two of them so it looks you

267
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,480
know that's pretty good

268
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,839
performance now if you really want to

269
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:02,959
understand

270
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,000
why um we need to adopt ipv6

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,560
you need to look at the world population

272
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,440
because

273
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,040
the world has 7.6 billion people in it

274
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,240
and about 60 percent of the people

275
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,120
have internet and about 40 percent don't

276
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,000
which means

277
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
that that there is 40 percent of the

278
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,120
world that is still

279
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,560
going to need an ip address

280
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,160
so to understand how that um how that

281
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,120
works

282
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,600
if you look at the global internet

283
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,720
increases over the last 15 years

284
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,760
it's helpful to look at it in terms of

285
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
your users worldwide which is the blue

286
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,360
line and then

287
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,399
users in the developing world which is

288
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,839
the orange light and users in the

289
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,519
developed line and the developed world

290
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,880
which is the green line

291
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,560
and you can see that um that the the

292
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,200
develop world has gone from about 51

293
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,680
percent to at 87 percent

294
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,000
but the users in the develop world have

295
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,519
gone from about

296
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,399
eight percent to 52 percent and it's

297
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,000
important to look at it this way because

298
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,440
if you can do the math it's very

299
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,079
apparent

300
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,519
that um there are obviously a lot more

301
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,000
users

302
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,920
in the developing world than there are

303
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,440
in the developed world

304
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,120
and there's a lot more people that need

305
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,040
to be onboarded onto the internet

306
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,800
now if we take that and we do it again

307
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,399
do a percentage a year-over-year

308
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,240
percentage increase of that

309
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,920
you can see that the developing world

310
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
actually is starting to grow

311
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,399
and starting to access the internet at a

312
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,519
very uh except

313
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,560
at a very accelerated rate so a lot more

314
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,320
people in develop world are getting onto

315
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,600
the internet and they're going to need

316
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,040
ip addresses

317
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,440
and they're not going to fit in what's

318
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,240
left for v4

319
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,160
so now that we've looked at uh how the

320
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,360
ipv6 has

321
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,079
has grown and and how many addresses are

322
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,200
needed i thought it was

323
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,079
a little time to take a look at ipv6

324
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,600
security

325
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,480
um and it turns out that ipv6 is not

326
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,800
only outpacing ipv4 in the address

327
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
address tables it's actually also

328
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
leading the way in

329
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,680
rpki adoption um as you know rbki is a

330
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,600
crucial tool in preventing

331
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,120
leaks and hijacks and um the number of

332
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,160
ipv6

333
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,399
prefixes with rows is outpacing the one

334
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,519
of ipv4

335
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,160
so let's take a look if we look at the

336
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,120
global tables

337
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,519
in just this inlet in january just last

338
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,560
month

339
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,600
we can see that um that ipv4 prefixes

340
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,639
with roas

341
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,120
are there with valid roads are about 26

342
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,800
percent invalid about 1

343
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,680
for a total of 27 percent of those ipv4

344
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,240
prefix

345
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,519
fixes with roas whereas theirs and 73

346
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:44,480
percent without

347
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,079
but in ipv6 we've got 31 percent with

348
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,120
valid and 1

349
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,920
with invalid for a total of 32 percent

350
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,240
of

351
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,959
of prefixes that have roasts for ipv6

352
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,000
that means that

353
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,320
it's it's being adopted at a lot faster

354
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,240
rate and you don't go to the trouble of

355
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,680
making a row unless you're actually

356
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,880
going to use it so

357
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,800
you know that does speak pretty highly

358
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,040
of the importance of ipv6

359
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,440
as far as security goes so let's look at

360
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,639
ipv4 versus

361
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,920
ipv6 um as far as ipv

362
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,680
as far as how much of the internet they

363
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,760
take up

364
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,240
it's important to understand how much

365
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,760
each rar has

366
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,360
the percentage of the prefixes in the

367
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,800
internet to understand where the work

368
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,480
needs to be done

369
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,760
afronic has about 3.7 percent of the

370
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,279
ipv4 addresses then about 1.63 percent

371
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,279
uh one point thirteen percent of the

372
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,800
ipv6

373
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,079
um ap nick has about 23 percent of ipv4

374
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,760
addresses and 28

375
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,639
of the ipv6 addresses and aaron has 37

376
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,360
of the ipv4 addresses and 22 percent of

377
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,560
ipd6

378
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,600
lacnic has about 10 percent of ipv4 and

379
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,440
21 percent of ipv6

380
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,560
and ripe has about 25 of ipv4

381
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,240
and about 28 percent of ipv6 so this is

382
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,800
how the

383
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,000
addresses are distributed are

384
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,360
distributed now if we look at

385
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,519
for ipv6 we're trying to figure out

386
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,000
where this work is to be done

387
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,480
we can see that in aphronic even though

388
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,120
they only have one point

389
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,240
one point one percent of of the internet

390
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,800
space

391
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,160
the ipv6 they have 22 percent of that

392
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,440
space in roas

393
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,680
so actually ap afronic is doing really

394
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,839
well as far as creating row is for its

395
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:30,399
um

396
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,519
for the for its ipv6 space uh ap nick

397
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:33,839
has

398
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,120
30 percent of uh its space in rows and

399
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,360
you know and it comprises 28 percent of

400
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,600
ipv6 space in the internet

401
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,639
aaron has 18 of its

402
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,279
prefixes in rose and has 22 percent of

403
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,079
the space

404
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,720
lack nick has 29 percent of its space in

405
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,360
roas

406
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,160
and ripe has 46 percent of its space in

407
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,040
roast and both

408
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,760
lactic and ripe have 21 and 27 percent

409
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,440
of the space respectively

410
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,560
so what that tells you is that ripe is

411
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,079
actually doing the best job of all the

412
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,880
rirs getting rose for its prefixes

413
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,320
aaron is um not doing it's not depressed

414
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,440
probably doing the

415
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,839
the worst because it has the lowest

416
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,720
ratio of

417
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,079
um ip of a row as compared to the amount

418
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,519
of space on the internet and it means

419
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,959
that there's a lot of work to be done in

420
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,000
erin

421
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,240
as far as making rowa's if we look at

422
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,199
the percentage of ipv4 and ipv6

423
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,240
with roas you can see that afronic is

424
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,680
actually doing a lot better

425
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,959
for i for ipv6 and ipv4 they have about

426
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:35,519
8

427
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,880
of their ipv4 prefixes in rows and 22

428
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,800
in ipv6 29 versus 30 and ap neck

429
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,600
14 versus 18 and aaron and 35 versus 29

430
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,720
in lachnik and 42 versus 46 and right

431
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,160
again ripe's doing great in all

432
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,959
categories

433
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,560
um aaron is doing even worse in ipv6

434
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,040
ipv4 unfortunately because it has 37

435
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,680
percent

436
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,560
of the world's ipv4 space and only 14 of

437
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:02,959
that

438
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,680
is in rows so if the amount of prefixes

439
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,880
and rows is going to increase

440
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
dramatically um a little bit of work

441
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,440
needs to be focused there

442
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,560
now um when i was doing this talk i was

443
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,120
talking to my colleague um

444
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,160
uh on rug and uh and this was

445
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,360
what i was i was actually i've been

446
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,480
talking about ipv6 and ipv4 rose for a

447
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,199
while

448
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,920
and um after i was talking to him about

449
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,839
the amount of people that had rose in

450
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,160
ipv4 he decided to go take a look in

451
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,199
india

452
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,320
and see how many of the prefixes in in

453
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,959
india

454
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,759
had row as an ipv4 and when he looked in

455
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,560
july

456
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,360
they only had 13 percent uh anurag

457
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,320
belongs to

458
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,920
a uh a nog called uh indiana

459
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,120
in nog um and he is actually the

460
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,959
chairman the co-chairman of the program

461
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,560
committee and he thought you know what

462
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,160
um i'm going to go talk to my friends

463
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,360
and see if we can make things a little

464
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,160
bit better

465
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,680
and so they went out and started

466
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,920
evangelizing creating roas because

467
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,920
they thought that india shouldn't be at

468
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,079
13 when the global average at that time

469
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,480
was about 24

470
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,720
so in october he came back to me and he

471
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,679
showed me this

472
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,919
these these numbers where india had

473
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,199
increased the amount of

474
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,439
ipv4 prefixes in roas to 31

475
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,079
with valid rows plus one you know so 32

476
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,000
percent of its space versus 68

477
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,160
not dramatic increase that's a great

478
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
deal i was really impressed and so i

479
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,280
asked him i said well

480
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,000
what's your ipv6 space like well it

481
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,799
turned out

482
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,600
that it was about 10 percent and it you

483
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,520
know that which wasn't very good

484
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
but onorag decided that they might be

485
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,760
able to do better on that too

486
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,440
so they went out and these are the

487
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,280
results for february

488
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,799
they're up to 42 percent of their ipv4

489
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,160
prefixes in rowa and

490
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,080
41 of their ipv6 prefixes in roma

491
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,919
and you have to realize that this is not

492
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,200
a small effort it's not like they could

493
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,080
just go out to one

494
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,760
isp and get them to uh to put their

495
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,360
prefixes in rows and everything will

496
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,799
dramatically increase

497
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,000
as you saw ipv6 is you know a big deal

498
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,440
in india it's the second largest

499
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,600
deployment of ipv6 in the world

500
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,360
and yet they and they were able in the

501
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,640
space of four months

502
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,760
to go from 10 of their prefixes in rows

503
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,200
to 40 so that's incredible and

504
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,960
if this were a live meeting right now

505
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,039
i'd be asking you all to stand up

506
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,360
and give india a round of applause that

507
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,160
they get here

508
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,640
all the way from atlanta where we would

509
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,200
be

510
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,440
to india but since we're not you can't

511
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,120
do that however

512
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,200
it did make me think if these people

513
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,039
could do such a great job and have so

514
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,039
much pride in their um

515
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,480
in their internet infrastructure that

516
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,200
they wanted to make sure it was secured

517
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,600
we could actually do the same thing and

518
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,880
here's what it looks like in north

519
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,080
america

520
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,720
we're going back to erin having 14 of

521
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,160
its prefixes in row is

522
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,160
and for ipv4 and 18 in ipv6

523
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,000
so how about it people perhaps we could

524
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,840
do the same thing as our friends over in

525
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,799
indiana

526
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,200
and go talk to all of those networks out

527
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,160
there and ask them

528
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
why they are not putting their prefixes

529
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,080
into making creating row is for all of

530
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,600
their prefixes

531
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,320
so it might be a good thing to start so

532
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,400
ipv6 25 years in summary

533
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,120
over 30 of the world's internet users

534
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,280
are routed over ipv6 and this

535
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,400
is steadily increasing the ipv6 routing

536
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,120
table growth

537
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,400
is very healthy and outpacing ipv4

538
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,480
and internet user numbers are increasing

539
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,600
at a rapid rate and ipv6 is the only

540
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,960
protocol that has room for them all

541
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,559
thank you for your kind attention are

542
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:52,000
there any questions

543
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,799
well that was an awesome presentation

544
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,000
not only can ipv6 rank but it can do it

545
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,520
everywhere in the world legally

546
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,880
we do have some questions

547
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,320
in the q a queue and i'm taking them

548
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,240
out of order so first question

549
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,640
have you seen cases where ipv6 can

550
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,520
provide something ipv4 cannot in the

551
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,360
enterprise

552
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,000
how long will how to make a compelling

553
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,159
business proposal to start deploying

554
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,400
ipv6 in a medium-sized enterprise

555
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,200
besides

556
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,960
before exhaustion education and

557
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,360
preparedness

558
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,120
well i guess i could start by saying

559
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,520
that i i don't work in an enterprise so

560
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,120
i don't know that i am

561
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,120
you know i work in isp so i don't know

562
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,640
that i am uh

563
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,360
qualified to talk about how v6 can

564
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,039
provide something in the enterprise that

565
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,960
can't that ipv4 can't but i can say that

566
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,000
uh the compelling business case for ipv6

567
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,760
is what i was trying to point out in the

568
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,280
talk which is 40

569
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,440
of the world is not on the internet yet

570
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,520
and that means that when they get on

571
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,200
a lot of the that percentage that

572
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,960
population is going to end up being

573
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,840
on v6 and sooner or later you are going

574
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,159
to start seeing more users on b6 than

575
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,120
before

576
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,679
and when that happens you do not want to

577
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,240
be in a hurry to deploy v6

578
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,640
it's far easier to do it you know slowly

579
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,440
deliberately

580
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,679
and carefully now so that you have your

581
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,640
deployment working

582
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,720
exactly how you want and all the bugs

583
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,679
worked out of it

584
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,159
before you get to the point where you're

585
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,919
in a panic and you've got to deploy v6

586
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,520
or you're not on the internet

587
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,760
so i would say that that is you know one

588
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,200
of the one of the biggest thing as far

589
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,080
as you know

590
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
uh logistics and operations but the

591
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,000
second thing of course is that ipb4

592
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
space costs money right now

593
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,480
and if you can reduce your dependency on

594
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,200
it then

595
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,799
you are going to have an advantage as

596
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,320
far as the you know the cost of

597
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,120
operating your business

598
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,000
cool uh next question uh this one is by

599
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,240
patrick no last name uh isn't v6 table

600
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,840
growth a bad thing

601
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,440
i thought the point was to hand each

602
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,360
isps 24

603
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
and just have a few thousand prefixes

604
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,159
total in the dfc

605
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,720
okay so um i don't think it's a bad

606
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,440
thing

607
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,360
um because the reality is is that as

608
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,960
more people get on the internet you're

609
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,320
going to need more addresses

610
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,559
so the prefix table is probably going to

611
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,240
grow i don't know

612
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,679
if ipv6 the ipv6 table will ever be as

613
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,600
big as the ipv4 table

614
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,840
just because a slash you know you can

615
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,799
advertise a slash

616
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,400
32 on the internet or slash 48 and

617
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,039
that's still

618
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,919
more ad you know addresses than all of

619
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,760
ipv4 put together

620
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,440
so um so you're probably not each um

621
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,960
you know network is probably not going

622
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,960
to have to advertise as many ipv6

623
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,280
prefixes as they do ipv4

624
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,720
but um i think that

625
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,840
uh the the important thing is that

626
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,159
it it would be nice that the ipv4 table

627
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,919
weren't growing so fast and we were

628
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,679
and we were increasing our reliance on

629
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,280
ipv6 because

630
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,000
then um we probably wouldn't be running

631
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,480
out of

632
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,559
memory on our routers so quickly and it

633
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,559
would be cheaper to run our yet to uh

634
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,120
operate our infrastructure so um going

635
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,280
to v6 has an advantage there too and

636
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,679
then

637
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,120
you know i think that but i don't think

638
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,440
that having a large v6 table is a bad

639
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,000
thing

640
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,480
honestly i think that when we get to the

641
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,000
point where we have more

642
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,280
um traffic that's going across b6 than

643
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,720
before that's when we know we'll hit the

644
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,440
turning we've hit the turning point

645
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,559
okay so let me extrapolate off of that

646
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,760
so if v6 does the right thing

647
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,279
then we'll be able to take those sup

648
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,080
720s and rsp 720s out of the closet

649
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,520
because the tables will be small enough

650
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,600
that they won't blow up

651
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,799
well if they'll route me six

652
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,919
actually they will yeah um

653
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,159
it looks like we have time for two

654
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,600
questions left uh

655
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,840
one is uh do you agree with the 2017

656
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,720
published right

657
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,919
bcop for v6 assignment customers uh

658
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,279
which is

659
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,080
ripe 690 which has since been superseded

660
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,400
uh

661
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,440
recommending slash 48 for everyone and

662
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,960
what are your thoughts on providers what

663
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,760
you're doing is

664
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,159
64 instead well um

665
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,799
i know that like hurricane electric for

666
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,440
example

667
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,360
um does slash 64s inside of its network

668
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,960
for all of its customers

669
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,080
but you can request up to you know a 48

670
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,440
with most providers

671
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
i i don't know that anybody that would

672
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,120
um um

673
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,679
deny you one the 48 of course can be

674
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:40,480
advertised

675
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,960
on uh you know on the internet with you

676
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,559
know it doesn't have to have a

677
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,240
you know it's by itself it's like a slay

678
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,080
on the smallest prefix you can advertise

679
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,360
in v6 so

680
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,760
there's that advantage i'm assuming that

681
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,720
people who

682
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,480
give um 64s to the customers

683
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,000
are assuming that those customers won't

684
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,600
need to advertise those prefixes

685
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,640
independently

686
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,799
if they do then they should be given a

687
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,679
48

688
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,279
and i think that's the reason why most

689
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,520
providers make that distinction is that

690
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,360
the um the space isn't meant to be

691
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
multi-home if it was meant to be

692
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,640
multi-home then of course

693
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,480
you know they could ever they could you

694
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,840
know give a us

695
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,520
a previous large enough to advertise on

696
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,440
the internet so i think it's kind of

697
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:19,760
just

698
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,279
a matter of isp policy really more than

699
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,120
um something that's that's right or

700
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,480
wrong you know i

701
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,600
it's um you know you kind of hate to be

702
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,960
the person that tells somebody else how

703
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,840
to run their network

704
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,400
well i think i'm going to avoid the last

705
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,559
thought there uh i have one question for

706
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,600
me

707
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,919
which is what in your opinion

708
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,400
is the backlash

709
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,480
backscatter of pci consultants telling

710
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,440
customers

711
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,480
you can't use ipv6 and pci so you have

712
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,679
to turn it off across your enterprise

713
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,200
well i would say that

714
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,080
obviously is is wrong because lots of

715
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,120
large networks

716
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,320
use v6 only and

717
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,200
and lots of uh you know large you know

718
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
content providers inside of our

719
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,760
in inside of our industry put all of

720
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,120
their con put all of their

721
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,400
services across v6 so i would

722
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
i would counter that if you're having

723
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,200
difficulty making something work on ipv6

724
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,360
you probably just need to have a little

725
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,279
extra engineering and fix it

726
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,640
but you um you know to my to my

727
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,880
knowledge there isn't an obstacle to put

728
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,760
your service on ipv6

729
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,520
okay uh that was devil's advocate there

730
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,200
um so i think we're out of time at this

731
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,679
point

732
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,720
uh there are a couple more q a in the

733
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,799
session which you might want to answer

734
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,640
directly there

735
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,400
um thank you very much susan as always a

736
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:07,840
wonderful thing about v6

737
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,080
you
