2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:06,160
so

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,400
hello everyone i would like to talk a

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,800
little bit about security and design

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,200
let's begin right here which is that

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,160
oftentimes

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,239
in the networking world we're told that

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,240
we need to build security in from

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,039
day one we need to design the network in

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,039
a way that it is secure

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,519
but what does security in from day one

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,279
actually mean like how do we actually do

13
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,320
this

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,279
isn't doing security just a matter of

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,280
putting firewalls in the right places or

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,880
whatever the case might happen to be

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,960
uh packet filters or whatever in the

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,160
right places

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,680
well there are three thoughts that you

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,360
can push back on this this kind of

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,399
mentality with

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,320
and think about doing security from day

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,879
one or building security into the design

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,200
the first is to build simple now of

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,800
course i'm a huge advocate of

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,640
getting rid of complexity where you can

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,920
so this is not going to be a big

28
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,440
surprise coming from me

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,239
the second is building places for policy

30
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:58,879
so

31
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,879
intentionally setting aside places in

32
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,079
the network where

33
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,799
you can put policy in place and then

34
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,080
build measurable

35
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,080
really build in the telemetry that you

36
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,560
might need for security from day one

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,240
think about where you would measure

38
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,240
and why you would measure so here's a

39
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,759
quote from bruce schneier

40
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,479
which is about complexity and security

41
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,159
he says the internet and all the systems

42
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,000
we built today are getting more complex

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,680
at a rate that is faster than we are

44
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,119
capable of matching

45
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,000
and that is absolutely true security in

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
reality is actually improving

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,840
so what bruce schneier is saying here is

48
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,920
that we are getting better at security

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,400
but the target is constantly shifting so

50
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,600
we're getting better at hitting the

51
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,360
target but the target's getting narrower

52
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,000
smaller

53
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,399
and moving around on us as complexity

54
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,759
grows we are losing

55
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,880
ground so complexity then therefore

56
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,759
is the enemy of security but why let's

57
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,240
talk about why that might happen to be

58
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,240
let's begin here with that thought which

59
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,280
is that

60
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,640
what we can think about in the

61
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,320
networking world for complexity is we

62
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,000
can think about a three-way trade-off

63
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,719
state

64
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,880
optimization and surfaces if you've ever

65
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,799
heard me present on complexity or

66
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,479
any other topic i tend to bring these

67
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,199
things in a lot this three-way trade-off

68
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,878
so when i look when i talk about

69
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,879
surfaces though a lot of people don't

70
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,560
totally understand what i'm saying when

71
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,080
i talk about a surface

72
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,280
so interaction surfaces have two ways of

73
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,440
being measured or to be thought about

74
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,280
the first is is the breadth of the

75
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,480
interaction surface

76
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,040
so the two systems that interact over a

77
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,800
broad interaction surface

78
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,200
interact in a lot of different places as

79
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,879
you can see there's a lot of arrows

80
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,519
that run between these two the second

81
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,080
thing is

82
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,920
is that there is a depth of interaction

83
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,280
surfaces so

84
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,319
the deeper the system

85
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,239
the two systems interact in terms of

86
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,080
using state from the other system

87
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,000
in order to do something locally within

88
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,160
the system the deeper that interaction

89
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,959
surface is

90
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,080
so this illustration shows you two two

91
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,200
different systems

92
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
that are interacting with one another

93
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,400
through a single international

94
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
interaction surface

95
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,760
but they are deeply doing so they're not

96
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,920
very broad there's not a lot of places

97
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,280
but they're very deep

98
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
so up here we have two systems that are

99
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,200
not only broadly interacting but they're

100
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,840
also

101
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,159
deeply interacting now what we want to

102
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,159
get to is we want to get to a system

103
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,840
that is only interacting very narrowly

104
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,400
and as

105
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
shallowly as possible with as much

106
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,560
shallow interaction as possible

107
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,319
why because the broader and deeper the

108
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,159
interaction surfaces the tighter the

109
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,920
binding between the two systems

110
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,760
if you have two systems that are tightly

111
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,680
bound what you've done is you've enabled

112
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,519
cross-system attacks

113
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,159
in ways that you may not expect expect

114
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,840
another thing is the more there are

115
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,680
these interaction surfaces in here

116
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,280
these places where these two systems

117
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,760
interact you get a larger and richer

118
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,000
attack surface so broader interaction

119
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,080
surfaces give you a larger

120
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,239
attack surface and deeper interaction

121
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,599
surfaces give you

122
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,159
a richer attack surface so what you

123
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,239
really want to get to as a rule of thumb

124
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,840
is to have these two systems to be

125
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,120
hermetically sealed where they're not

126
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,760
able to

127
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,920
interact with one and of course that's

128
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,840
irrational or that's not possible in the

129
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,120
networking world because otherwise you

130
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,560
wouldn't have the two systems there in

131
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,360
the first place

132
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,959
now if we talk about the way a

133
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,680
particular system is designed from the

134
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,519
outside and the inside from the outside

135
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,000
it looks like

136
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,560
an opaque box the system just looks like

137
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,279
something that

138
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,079
i can push inputs into and i get outputs

139
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,639
out of

140
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,360
or push inputs into up here or down here

141
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,120
and i get them out on the top

142
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,360
so i can think of those outputs as being

143
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
sort of a reshaping of the system

144
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,919
or my exterior view of that system so

145
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,000
it's an opaque box that i can push on

146
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,040
and make things go in a certain way now

147
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,479
what happens however

148
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,560
is that while i might expect if i push

149
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,080
here on the system i get a nice

150
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,880
even parallel push on the outside so i

151
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,800
get the data out that i'm expecting

152
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,720
in real life what i have is a lot of

153
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,240
unintended consequences

154
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,919
if i push over here i actually get

155
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,520
something that's coming out in a

156
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,360
different place than i expected this is

157
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,759
an

158
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,000
unintended consequence this is a

159
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
mismatch between the way the system

160
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,080
works and the way you think it works

161
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,639
so the more complex this system is the

162
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,160
more likely you are to have this

163
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,039
situation

164
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,560
where there's a mismatch between what

165
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,400
you think it does and what it actually

166
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,960
does

167
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,199
so this is something what we would call

168
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,240
this technical debt

169
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,000
actually this is a form of technical

170
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,360
debt in our systems

171
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,199
that we think it works one way and it

172
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,639
actually works a different way

173
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,320
and one way you solve the technical debt

174
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,680
problem in

175
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,080
coding is you refactor the system so

176
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
that you match your expectations

177
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,280
to the actual operation of that system

178
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
so every unintended consequence that i

179
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,440
get into is an attack surface

180
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,639
if i can attack a device or a system

181
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,400
by pushing on it in a particular place

182
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,680
by feeding it data

183
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,520
and having the result be something you

184
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,800
don't expect as an

185
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,280
administrator or an operator then i've

186
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,360
actually opened an attack surface in

187
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,240
your network

188
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
so one thing i can do is i can simplify

189
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,280
these systems

190
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,600
to reduce the unintended consequences

191
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,440
which means in two directions first of

192
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:57,840
all

193
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,199
that i actually understand how the

194
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,360
system works so i'm expecting

195
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,240
this sideways output from the input and

196
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:04,800
the second

197
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,840
is to control the output to be more

198
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,400
parallel to what i think i'm actually

199
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,280
should be getting

200
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,520
so another point that you get into with

201
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,199
good interaction surfaces

202
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,840
is that policy containment is very very

203
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,240
key

204
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,199
to so to security i want to contain my

205
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,000
policy

206
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,800
within a module or at or to an

207
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,160
interaction surface

208
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,319
the reason i want to do this is the more

209
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,560
i have my policy encapsulated within

210
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,120
this system or this system or the more i

211
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,080
have it encapsulated

212
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,479
along this interaction surface the

213
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,560
easier it is for me to understand

214
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,120
and pin down what that policy is doing

215
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,240
there's something here called the

216
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
subsidiarity principle as well

217
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,560
this is kind of an extended version of

218
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
the subsidiary principle

219
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,800
instead of the social part of it which

220
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,599
usually is

221
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,160
the subsidiary principle says that what

222
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,000
i want to do is i want to pull

223
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,280
my decision making to the closest point

224
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,039
that has the information about making

225
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,720
that decision you would normally apply

226
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,680
this to government

227
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,840
to governance to social structures

228
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,800
things like that

229
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,039
within a network what this might mean is

230
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:09,919
it might mean

231
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,440
i want to say that this module has the

232
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,520
information required to make a policy

233
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,240
decision

234
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,400
i want to make that policy decision in

235
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,440
this module

236
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,599
rather than in a separate module through

237
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,880
an interaction surface

238
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,039
so this is just a way of trying to

239
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,840
simplify things as much as possible

240
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,720
so let's talk about places for measuring

241
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
measurement requires context

242
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,479
so we need to know when we're measuring

243
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,720
something what normal looks like this is

244
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,639
where people miss it a lot of times

245
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,400
when they're troubleshooting or dealing

246
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,080
with security is they think

247
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,919
i can just measure this and i don't

248
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,680
really need to know what normal looks

249
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,240
like

250
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,000
but it often happens if you don't know

251
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,440
what normal looks like you don't know

252
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,560
why it's broken

253
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,840
or why it's why it's insecure what the

254
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,960
attacker is doing

255
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,639
you just kind of guess based on

256
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,400
background knowledge or rules of thumb

257
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,759
or something like that

258
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,080
so you need to be able to measure what

259
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,280
normal looks like

260
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,680
and then you need to know why normal

261
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,039
works looks that way

262
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,319
or rather how this system works in

263
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,479
internally so having these clear

264
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,919
interaction surfaces

265
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,280
with shallow and narrow interaction

266
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
surfaces or interactions between these

267
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,080
systems

268
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,120
allows me to better understand what i

269
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,160
should be measuring

270
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,560
the more places i need to measure and

271
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,240
the more these measurements are deep

272
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,039
measurements

273
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,039
the less able i am to do effective

274
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,279
telemetry to understand exactly what's

275
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,080
going on

276
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,320
and what i'm trading off in having those

277
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,599
types of things

278
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,080
so we normally reduce complexity via

279
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,279
modularization

280
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,479
you've probably heard me say this a

281
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,159
thousand times but there's this concept

282
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,600
of the wasp waste

283
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,080
and what i have here is i have a typical

284
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,279
wasp or a bee

285
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,320
and this particular bee or wasp has a

286
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,839
lot of complexity down here there's a

287
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:54,959
stinger and there's

288
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,720
a stomach and all these other things and

289
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,160
then a lot of complexity here there's a

290
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,920
lot of muscle structure to support those

291
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,200
wings and the legs

292
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,880
and digestive systems and stuff like

293
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
that so these are separated by

294
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,000
this little wasp waste and this wasp

295
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
waste is a containment mechanism

296
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,240
so i can do the same thing in my network

297
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,160
i actually control complexity

298
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,560
by inserting these interaction surfaces

299
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,880
and modularizing what i'm doing

300
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,320
what's interesting is this

301
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,399
modularization point also gives us

302
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,040
places

303
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,760
to insert policy in places to measure

304
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,399
things

305
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,640
so my modularization that i'm already

306
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,320
doing to reduce complexity

307
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,480
and again complexity is the enemy of

308
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,360
security

309
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,080
is also helping me in security so let's

310
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
think about how this might work in a

311
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,920
data center fabric let's say

312
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,760
so let's think about in a data center

313
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,600
fabric what we normally think about

314
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,320
in terms of modularization might be my

315
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,120
pods

316
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,040
or something like this and i might think

317
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,360
in a normal hierarchical network

318
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,680
or in a normal network design i'm

319
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,040
thinking about having

320
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
three layers and i might have my access

321
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,720
layer or

322
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,080
two layers i might have my access

323
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,320
distribution and then my core or i might

324
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,959
have three

325
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,120
two layers which are like just my access

326
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,240
or aggregation

327
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,160
and core or something like this and what

328
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,320
i'm doing is i'm doing aggregation route

329
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,200
aggregation

330
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,040
probably in my second or third layer or

331
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
along the lines between these layers

332
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,200
in order to reduce complexity and to

333
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,800
modularize the network

334
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,880
in a data center this bottom layer

335
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,240
fabric is often

336
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,040
a single flat failure domain now i might

337
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,959
be running bgp or a link state protocol

338
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,160
or whatever on that

339
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,560
fabric but it's largely going to be as

340
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,360
an underlay

341
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,839
it's going to be a single failure domain

342
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,360
so what i need to do in a data center

343
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,000
environment

344
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,720
is rather than modularizing horizontally

345
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,000
i modularize

346
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,360
vertically so my underlay is one failure

347
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,000
domain

348
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,200
and then i may have a a network overlay

349
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,279
and say this might be evpn

350
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,200
sitting here and it's going to be my

351
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,480
second module

352
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,000
and then i may have an application

353
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,160
overlay that sits on top of this maybe

354
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,360
running sxt

355
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,200
or whatever the case might happen to be

356
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,720
kafka or whatever it is

357
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,880
kubernetes or whatever that is going to

358
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,959
give me my third layer so what i'm doing

359
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,360
is i'm modularizing in order to simplify

360
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,760
but what this also does is this allows

361
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,519
me to break these up not

362
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,680
into failure domains but that also

363
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,560
breaks them up

364
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,000
into security domains what i want to do

365
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,680
is i want to think about this

366
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,519
underlay fabric as being a single

367
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,800
security domain

368
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,200
and my overlay to be a separate security

369
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,120
domain and then my app overlay

370
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,959
to be a separate security domain

371
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,320
separately again so

372
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,519
for instance if i design my

373
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,839
underlay such that the underlay cannot

374
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:36,880
be attacked

375
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,680
by any host or device that's attached to

376
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,200
these type of rack switches

377
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,120
somehow i force it to bypass the

378
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,480
underlay and only talk to the

379
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,120
network overlay that increases my

380
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,160
security

381
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,040
on this underlay fabric so that is the

382
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,880
type of thing that i can do

383
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
so what i want to do is for instance i

384
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,360
want to use this modularization

385
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,160
to increase security by allowing hosts

386
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,600
and other applications

387
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,519
and applications running on the host to

388
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,680
only talk to one particular

389
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,600
part of the network or one particular

390
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,959
module

391
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,360
so now for instance if i look at this

392
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,160
and i think

393
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,000
i'm going to have these two hosts and

394
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,680
they're going to be attached to top of

395
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,240
rack switches

396
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,279
what happens if someone owns or roots

397
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,639
this host and can then talk to the

398
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,519
underlay

399
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,600
in a way that can cause the entire

400
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,360
fabric to fail

401
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,440
that would be a very very very bad thing

402
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,000
so what we can do here is if i want to

403
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,800
run routing

404
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,120
on this host then what i do is i only

405
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,560
run the overlay

406
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,720
if i only run the overlay routing

407
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,880
protocol or the overlay control plane

408
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,800
on this host then it would only have

409
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,880
access to what it would have access to

410
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
its particular vlan

411
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,000
or its particular verf or whatever you

412
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,360
want to call it

413
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,279
it's ethernet segment it's es or

414
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,480
whatever you want to call it in

415
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,000
different control planes

416
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and that's pretty much it well it would

417
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,680
have access to the other hosts that are

418
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
also the other processes that are on

419
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,680
that same es or that same vlan

420
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,839
but that's all it would have it wouldn't

421
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,880
have access to

422
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,560
a lot of the other stuff that's out

423
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,240
there like the control plane for the

424
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,959
underlay

425
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,839
it wouldn't be able to ddos this router

426
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:18,720
because it does

427
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,639
while it has this physical connection it

428
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,639
doesn't have access to the right ports

429
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,360
and stuff

430
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,399
to get that so the way that you

431
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,200
deal with your routing on the control

432
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,240
plane directly

433
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,200
impacts the security of your data center

434
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,760
fabric

435
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,279
so here is a point where my design

436
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,959
and the way i have designed the network

437
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,519
from a modularization point of view

438
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,399
is actually directly impacting my

439
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,279
security

440
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,920
of the network so it's very important to

441
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,160
think about it in these terms

442
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,360
another thing that's interesting to

443
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
think about here is if i have a single

444
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,399
control plane

445
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,800
in both the underlay and the overlay and

446
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,040
the host can talk to that control plane

447
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
and take that control plane down in the

448
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
overlay it can in theory

449
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,440
impact the underlay once again if i've

450
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,560
not thought through

451
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,360
my modularization correctly and both of

452
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,000
these

453
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,920
planes are running the same routing

454
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,000
protocol then i end up in a position

455
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,880
where attacking

456
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,680
this routing protocol also attacks this

457
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,720
routing protocol

458
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,800
so i've actually merged the two failure

459
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,279
domains and i've also merged the two

460
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,600
security domains now of course this is

461
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,560
all going to depend on your

462
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,600
implementation

463
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,040
and how you've done things in your

464
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,959
design so again

465
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,199
this is something to think about when

466
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,399
you're doing design

467
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,199
is whether or not you want to have these

468
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,320
things combined

469
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,800
or not and how you spread them out and

470
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,160
how you divide them

471
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,120
from a modularization perspective now

472
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,399
another example

473
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,920
is let's say i'm running is to is

474
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,720
in this network and that's my underlay

475
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,839
and let's say i'm running bgp to run

476
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,680
evpn in my overlay

477
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,160
so that is my two protocols so i've done

478
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,440
total separation

479
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,480
and the host let's say for some reason

480
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,720
can still talk to this router or this

481
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,079
type of rack switch

482
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,120
using is well you might think well

483
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,399
there's not a lot it can do it can

484
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,160
inject routes things like this

485
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
but let's say that i'm very very

486
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,680
concerned about

487
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,079
the speed of convergence in this network

488
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,800
so i tighten my isis timers down way way

489
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,360
down

490
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,040
and i try to get it to converge and say

491
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,680
50 milliseconds or 100 milliseconds

492
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,519
or whatever it is so i tighten up

493
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,519
everything and i use

494
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,440
and i use exponential back off

495
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,199
for my timers so that i can

496
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,839
force spf to run very very quickly the

497
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,120
first time there's a change in the

498
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,680
network

499
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,320
and then it runs more slowly over time

500
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,240
as more changes take place

501
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,320
well if you think about it if this host

502
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,399
has access to is

503
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,800
and i have tightly tuned timers what

504
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,920
this host can do

505
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,680
without even knowing what routes to

506
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,399
inject or what to do to bring the fabric

507
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:02,959
down

508
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,959
it can simply slow down the convergence

509
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,959
of the fabric by constantly

510
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,720
injecting new lsps in the network

511
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,240
at the pace required to cause spf to run

512
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,199
more slowly

513
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,160
across all of these devices so what

514
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,519
that's going to do is when there's a

515
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,040
real change in the network

516
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,199
say this d2 to d1 link fails

517
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,120
these routers or these intermediate

518
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,839
systems will converge much more slowly

519
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,440
because they'll be running against their

520
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,199
higher end of the top end

521
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,639
of the exponential back off in the

522
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,959
network so again this is a situation

523
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:37,680
where

524
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,759
even if you split things up correctly

525
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,959
you've not thought through

526
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,959
all of the attack surfaces in your

527
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,720
design so what you might want to do in

528
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,160
this situation

529
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,240
is to make sure this interface is a

530
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,600
passive interface

531
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,839
another point to make about this is this

532
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,519
is another example of the state

533
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,600
optimization surface trade-off

534
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,759
right what i've done is is i have

535
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,920
tightly modified the convergence speed

536
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,839
or tightly managed the convergence

537
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:02,959
speeder optimized

538
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,439
the convergence speed in this fabric to

539
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,439
make it as fast as possible

540
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,760
but in doing so what i've done is i've

541
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,480
made myself

542
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,720
extremely sensitive to the rate of the

543
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,760
state

544
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
that's in this fabric so if somebody

545
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,599
comes along and starts shoving state

546
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,559
into this fabric

547
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,359
really really fast it actually reduces

548
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,799
my optimization

549
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,959
by working against what i've optimized

550
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,799
for so this is again one of those

551
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,240
situations where you have to think

552
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,880
through

553
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,679
does my design really really require

554
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:32,080
this

555
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,640
super fast convergence or am i okay

556
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,160
slowing the convergence down

557
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,160
in order to manage that attack surface

558
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
so we can think through

559
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,960
how to use modularization and how to use

560
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,240
network design to build security in even

561
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,080
before we get to the point of thinking

562
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,320
about firewalls staple packet filters

563
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,080
packet filters of various kinds whatever

564
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,360
it happens to be

565
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,919
i can actually think through my network

566
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,440
and think through where i'm creating

567
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,720
attack surfaces

568
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,400
where i'm doing interaction surfaces

569
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,640
between modules whether those modules

570
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,160
are truly separated

571
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,320
or what i'm actually doing with those

572
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
things in order to think through the

573
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,000
security ramifications of my

574
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,400
design before i deploy it before i even

575
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,200
get to

576
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,760
packet filters so again to optimize you

577
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,280
either increase state or create new

578
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,080
surfaces

579
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,760
and as i'm creating new surfaces or

580
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,520
removing state i always

581
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,919
almost always leads to less optimization

582
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,080
so reducing complexity one one last

583
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,440
point about this is that

584
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,760
reducing complexity locally almost

585
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,559
always

586
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,840
increases complexity globally so as i've

587
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,600
decreased my complexity

588
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,400
in each individual device or in each

589
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,679
individual system

590
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,280
i'm actually increasing overall

591
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,039
complexity globally

592
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,760
so i need to think through what i'm

593
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,760
optimizing locally and globally

594
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,440
and think through where i'm increasing

595
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,679
complexity and go back to

596
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,760
security or complexity is the enemy of

597
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,320
security and i need to think about

598
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,039
how i'm going to balance those things

599
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,039
and make the network secure

600
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,200
so that is it so i'll leave this open

601
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,240
for questions

602
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,000
and this is just some other places you

603
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,840
can find me if you're interested in some

604
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,799
of my other work

605
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,120
it's my blog my podcast and my other

606
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,080
podcast

607
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,760
that you might want to listen to thanks

608
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,600
for listening and i hope this has been

609
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,919
helpful in just connecting for you

610
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:24,799
mentally

611
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,520
the concept of security against the

612
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,880
concept of design

613
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,640
and giving you some pointers in how to

614
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:39,039
think about design in a more secure way

615
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,120
this was uh russ white presenting on

616
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,440
security and design

617
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,880
russ white is well known in our

618
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
community rus is an infrastructure

619
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,960
architect to join for networks

620
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,240
and was just talking to us from raleigh

621
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,919
north carolina

622
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,320
this is russ's seventh present present

623
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,080
time presenting at nanook

624
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,240
russ first presented a talk called

625
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,559
trade-offs in network complexity

626
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,280
at nanox 60 in 2014 in atlanta

627
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,919
uh welcome back to nanograss and we're

628
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,760
certainly happy to have you

629
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,559
back today we're going to continue next

630
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,960
with a q a

631
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,000
first there was a comment made about

632
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,440
uh a false sense of zoning especially in

633
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,679
a world where we tunnel everything

634
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,120
anything through anything please comment

635
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,039
so yeah so i was going to answer this in

636
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,480
the chat window

637
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,200
but job i know what you're saying but i

638
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,600
think

639
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,559
the other way of looking at this is that

640
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,799
when we tunnel we actually are creating

641
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,440
vertical domains in a sense and that's

642
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,720
what we want to do is we want to think

643
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,360
about

644
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,039
how to make those vertical domains are

645
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,960
those vertically stacked domains into

646
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,600
separate failure and security domains

647
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,039
so yeah it is difficult to think in

648
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,799
terms of

649
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,120
zoning as far as the wasp waste goes and

650
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,080
everything from a

651
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,760
hierarchical perspective or a

652
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,919
topological method any longer but to try

653
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,919
to replace that a bit with the vertical

654
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,120
stacked ways of doing things so

655
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,240
i hope that was helpful oh

656
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,840
good thanks joe

657
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,640
very good uh the next question that came

658
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,240
up was um

659
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,720
about uh a use case where we would be

660
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,000
doing an igp

661
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,120
isis uh traffic inbound from a host

662
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,720
sport

663
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,840
yeah so i i've actually seen this in

664
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,280
real life which is why i put it in the

665
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,400
slides

666
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,640
people who run either a single overlay

667
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,159
with a single underlay

668
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,120
ip plane ip underlay with no overlay or

669
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,720
they are actually running an overlay

670
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,480
anyway and then they are running

671
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,600
is is or something else to the host to

672
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,000
run in the v router so that

673
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,159
so that evpn knows how to reach the

674
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,880
correct next tops in the right way

675
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,520
i consider that really dangerous i think

676
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,440
you should always make sure that

677
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,039
your um you should always make sure

678
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,159
that your fabric is protected

679
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,000
as far as the control plane the underlay

680
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,360
fabric should be construct

681
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,880
protected as far as the control plane

682
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,720
goes from anything going on

683
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,880
in the overlay or on the host even on

684
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,080
the v router

685
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
and i think that's just good value

686
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,440
domain separation and

687
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,880
good hygiene in network design so that's

688
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,360
kind of

689
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,559
okay thank you um

690
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,880
another question is what other general

691
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,280
rules to enhance security

692
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,400
of the underlay would you recommend so

693
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,600
one thing to think about

694
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,559
is to encrypt your traffic across your

695
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,159
own data center fabric

696
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,679
the problem with doing this is going to

697
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,600
be key distribution

698
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,000
and just the difficulty of configuring

699
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,919
and managing an encryption system

700
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,280
on top of a data center fabric that

701
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,559
is just very difficult to

702
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,520
mess with or figure out how to do that

703
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,799
so

704
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,080
you know i've talked to some of the

705
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,440
internal i've talked to security folks

706
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,280
who say you should be running maxsec

707
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,360
on your data center fabric well yeah

708
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,360
okay but max it's very very difficult to

709
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,120
deploy and it's very hard to think about

710
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
how you would do that

711
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,520
so that is one of the general rules you

712
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,159
can think about

713
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,600
is how to just consider running some

714
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,280
sort of encryption on your data center

715
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,320
fabric

716
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,480
to prevent insider attacks another one

717
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,360
is just

718
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,440
the whole concept of automation

719
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,880
repeatability

720
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,400
making sure that you don't keep open

721
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,480
ports treating devices

722
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,679
as part of the attack surface those i

723
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,039
think are general things that you can

724
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,880
think about as well that might be

725
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,279
useful

726
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,600
thank you russ what are your thoughts on

727
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,400
bgp

728
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,640
and the new external systematic

729
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,799
dependencies introduced by the

730
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,840
likes of rpki

731
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,440
oh so i had a data center fabric i don't

732
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,799
know that i would think about

733
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,159
pushing rpki into my data center fabric

734
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,640
it's more of an external thing as far as

735
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,799
external dependencies go well

736
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,679
i i really have this thing about bgp and

737
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,039
data center underlays that i actually

738
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,720
don't like bgp as the underlay

739
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,360
for a data center fabric because of some

740
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,799
of the things we're doing to bgp and

741
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,080
some of the external

742
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,080
externalities and stuff that go with it

743
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,360
so i'm not

744
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,880
entirely certain that answers the

745
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
question but maybe

746
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,120
uh if they want to continue and

747
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,039
let me see if i can see it okay

748
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,760
um what about um

749
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,799
what other material can the

750
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,840
nano community reference

751
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,200
to further learn about the um

752
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,240
design and insecurity concept that you

753
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,760
just covered

754
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,919
yeah so i think probably the only place

755
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,559
i've written about this in any way would

756
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:00,960
be

757
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,400
to think about is in network

758
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,600
problems and solutions and computer

759
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
networks i don't tend to spend a lot of

760
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,200
time talking about security although i

761
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,400
intend to spend more time in the

762
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,679
security realm

763
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,880
um in the coming years i saw a couple

764
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,000
other questions i don't know if you want

765
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,480
to do those a year how much time we have

766
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,600
yeah we have a minute left but go ahead

767
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,919
yeah if you want to comment so blake

768
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,120
said something about

769
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,200
abstractions are always leaky yes that

770
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,320
is the rule

771
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,159
of leaky abstractions and yes it's

772
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:31,600
absolutely true

773
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,840
that all extractions are leaking and

774
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,960
because they do

775
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,720
yet they are leaky you can end up in a

776
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,159
situation with something like a ddos

777
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,000
attack and an upper layer can impact

778
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,320
even a well isolated lower layer but of

779
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,120
course the more

780
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
isolation you have the less likely that

781
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,159
is to happen

782
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,760
so that's why you need to think about um

783
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,000
reducing the depth and the breadth of

784
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,080
the interaction surfaces

785
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,880
um and then blake asks also how can one

786
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,520
maintain

787
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,799
loose coupling between layers in

788
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,320
conjunction with differentiating between

789
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,679
volumetric attacks and production

790
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,640
traffic

791
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,480
yeah so the same sort of thing just

792
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,840
thinking about your

793
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,919
just thinking about the interaction

794
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,080
surface between your layers as an attack

795
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,880
surface and i do like the idea by the

796
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,600
way of

797
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,520
pulling out fibers halfway i think

798
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,679
that's i think that's a really good idea

799
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,279
let's go one final comment on complexity

800
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,880
is the enemy of security

801
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,320
final thoughts yeah oh that's absolutely

802
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,200
true

803
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,120
um this goes back to the first corollary

804
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,480
of keith's law

805
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,960
and that how important it is to reduce

806
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,640
complexity as much as possible in a

807
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,159
network to

808
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,520
make it where you can get your head

809
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,880
around things and understand what the

810
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,159
side effects will be when you do

811
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,159
something

812
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,799
okay well very good uh russ we uh thank

813
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,240
you very much for joining us uh the

814
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,000
network community appreciates

815
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,170
