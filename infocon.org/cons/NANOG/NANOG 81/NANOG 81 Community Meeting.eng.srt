00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,039
leading into the community meeting just

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,000
talking about a few

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,640
updates regarding to the organization

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,800
itself

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,599
so strategic plan updates for simplicity

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,359
we narrowed our strategic plan into

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,640
three key areas

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,119
education experience a meeting

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,360
experience and online collaboration

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,800
i won't go into details about the

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,640
strategic plan but you can follow this

plan another piece that we built out of

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,440
the strategic plan was the strategic

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,320
timeline

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,320

and the purpose of this strategic

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,280
timeline is to see

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,640
community and what things we're going to

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,359
push forward

32

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,400
they work very very hard um

76
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,120
our 2020 annual report will be coming

77
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,760
out soon

78
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
we should be seeing that in the next

79
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
couple of months the

80
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,440
staff is pulling us all together just to

81
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,360
give a kind of a

82
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,280
a linear record of what we have

83
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,959
accomplished what we did over the course

84
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,599
of 2020

85
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,000
and then finally for me uh we'll be

86
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
doing polls at the end of the session

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,599
if you're interested in participating in

88
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,920
these polls these are live polls

89
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,400
so you can go to this url poll ev.com

90
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,159
or you can join by text by texting 2233

91
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,920
and then also there's a mobile app that

92
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,599
you can download as well so

93
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,040
we're gonna bring the screen back up

94
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,120
again right before we start the polling

95
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,360
um but other than that enjoy the rest of

96
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,440
the presentations as i hand things off

97
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,840
to steve

98
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,200
thank you edward um next slide please

99
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,040
um so at the end of nanog

100
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,400
whichever one we just did in san

101
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,640
francisco um at the end of every

102
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,000
download we have a

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,080
program committee sort of uh get

104
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,840
together to review what happened and

105
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,120
talk about what we're going to do next

106
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,840
time

107
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,640
and we decided that sometime in 2020 we

108
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,080
should have an actual retreat like the

109
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,519
board does where we all get together for

110
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,319
a couple days

111
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,239
and go over our own strategic plans um

112
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,239
so we cleverly planned to do that

113
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,760
probably in boston

114
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,480
um in the summer or maybe if i didn't

115
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,680
work in seattle

116
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,720
uh and of course uh things changed and

117
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,159
we didn't get to meet in person

118
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,200
um so in december we ended up

119
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,640
having a virtual retreat where we all

120
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,799
got together in a couple of long zoom

121
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,840
meetings

122
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,519
and went over our own strategic plan um

123
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,599
there were two sessions one in december

124
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,560
one in january

125
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,120
um we talked about a bunch of things so

126
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,478
uh next slide

127
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,639
so the first day was talking about the

128
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,478
pc structure

129
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,040
various aspects of that are one of the

130
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,960
big things actually is how to

131
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,479
onboard new members to the program

132
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,120
committee some of you hopefully will

133
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,880
be joining the program committee next

134
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,479
week

135
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,759
and we want you to get up to speed as

136
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,440
quickly as possible and able to

137
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,800
contribute

138
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,960
so we talked about a few things like

139
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,400
fixing our documentation

140
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,240
the pc handbook is a living document

141
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,840
that's been around for years

142
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,520
but it rapidly gets out of date if

143
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,440
people don't pay attention to it so we

144
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,000
formed a

145
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,320
group that we'll go through and review

146
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,440
and update it to

147
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,080
reflect current reality and we also

148
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,120
talked a bit about

149
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,520
a mentorship program for new pc members

150
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,639
we did that

151
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,720
somewhat informally last year and it

152
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,560
seemed to have worked really well

153
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,360
so we want to keep doing that we talked

154
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,039
about the pc leadership

155
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,520
whether the current roles of chair vice

156
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,240
chair and secretary of the right ones

157
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,600
and documenting better what the

158
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,360
responsibilities of each

159
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,039
role is we talked about

160
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,919
the program committee subcommittees we

161
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,440
have a bunch of subcommittees some of

162
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,160
which

163
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
do a lot and some frankly don't do

164
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,520
anything at all so we talked about

165
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,120
reorganizing those to optimize our

166
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,039
effort

167
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,560
and we actually came up with the new one

168
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,240
which we'll talk about in a

169
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,960
few moments we also talked about the

170
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,400
general need to have a diversity of

171
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
skills and perspectives on the pc

172
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,120
um if we all think alike then the

173
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,639
program will be pretty bland but if we

174
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,840
have

175
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,280
people with different skill sets people

176
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,520
different industry perspectives um

177
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,600
then we can cover a lot of ground and

178
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,199
have what we hope is a

179
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,160
very good program the second uh day we

180
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,440
talked about a few other things

181
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,840
um we talked about the meeting format in

182
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,280
particular how we're going to deal with

183
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,720
hybrid meetings once we get to do those

184
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,759
we have right now are optimizing for

185
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,759
the reward audience which means that we

186
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,600
have limited amount of program time in

187
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,039
the day we have to

188
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,880
um uh be make it so that people on the

189
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,160
east and west coast of the us

190
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,680
can uh or canada can join um

191
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,280
productively we also want to

192
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,440
start setting aside specific time slots

193
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,039
for training tutorials

194
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,840
um as that works this way back into the

195
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,120
program

196
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,600
we talked about the soliciting talks and

197
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,720
soliciting speakers

198
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,919
um we want to expand both the topics

199
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,639
that we

200
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,000
are that we can cover um and the

201
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,039
pool of speakers that we have we want to

202
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,600
uh

203
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,520
document and standardize how we rate the

204
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,000
talks and how we review the

205
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,440
talk slides to make sure they meet our

206
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,039
standards

207
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,520
and ultimately this all comes into

208
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,240
figuring out what the

209
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,560
program committee strategic vision is so

210
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,240
that's something that um

211
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,840
pc will be working on over the next year

212
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,319
as well is articulating an actual vision

213
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,919
and making sure it's incorporated with

214
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,720
the organization's vision as a whole

215
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,680
um so with that i would like to pass it

216
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,240
on to

217
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,720
uh liz culley who is the chair of a new

218
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,479
subcommittee which is doing some data

219
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,759
analysis so liz please take it away

220
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,759
thanks steve so for the past 26 years

221
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,000
nag has been building a repository of

222
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,440
presentations tracks

223
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,880
and tutorials and lightning talks uh

224
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,039
also keynote speeches that is utterly

225
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,680
unique valuable and authoritative

226
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,680
nanak has a long and really brilliant

227
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,599
history of hosting the voices and wisdom

228
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,800
of those who are building and

229
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,240
maintaining the internet

230
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,479
and of in some cases being a primary

231
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,800
source of record for internet events

232
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,199
so i know that lots of us have searched

233
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,879
around for a specific talk we remember

234
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,800
hearing at anag a long time ago

235
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,879
because what comes up in nanag is often

236
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,160
on the leading edge

237
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,280
of technology trends that and that we

238
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,599
depend on for knowledge when they do

239
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,800
come up

240
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,960
so the pro this project that i'll be

241
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,240
discussing is really to mine that

242
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,440
repository

243
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,280
to understand what this community cares

244
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,319
about so that we can continue to deliver

245
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,759
what this community needs to keep up

246
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,319
with the onslaught of demand

247
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,280
so what we are doing right now is

248
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,400
cataloging

249
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,000
every one of those talks keynotes

250
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,240
uh lightning talks tracks and tutorials

251
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,360
um so that we have a single place

252
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,399
where we have a record of them uh

253
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,000
in addition to just cataloging we're

254
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,519
tagging every record with the relevant

255
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,399
metadata

256
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,080
that will help and this will help us in

257
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,720
a lot of ways uh number one it'll pro

258
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,560
we once we have this done we'll be able

259
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,399
to provide an intuitive web page of

260
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,480
popular topics with links to the youtube

261
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,040
videos

262
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,440
and their slide decks and we'll be able

263
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
to provide data to potential speakers on

264
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,880
the history of any subject

265
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,240
that has already been discussed

266
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,959
including uh say which topics are being

267
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,800
asked for most often in the survey

268
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,959
comments which topics are being viewed

269
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,320
most often on youtube

270
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,880
and a list of presentations on any topic

271
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,000
including links to

272
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,720
the youtube video in the deck so we can

273
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,800
use the survey data and youtube view

274
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,320
counts to forecast

275
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,000
which topics will be popular for

276
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,519
soliciting talks

277
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,880
we'll be able to create dynamic

278
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,480
introductions and i hope that you have

279
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,959
enjoyed

280
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,800
the ones that you've heard here at this

281
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,959
navigable already for each speaker with

282
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,800
relevant history of their previous toxic

283
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,760
mammog

284
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,000
and really having this knowledge of our

285
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,680
past is a great way to plan for the path

286
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,320
forward

287
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,959
here is the proof of concept of what

288
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,320
we're talking about here

289
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,279
we took the last five years we took

290
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,080
every talk

291
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,880
presentation and tagged it and here is

292
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,000
what we came up with

293
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,240
and as you look at this graph over to

294
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,000
the left hand side here in

295
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,440
the orange is how many times this topic

296
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,120
so we're talking about automation

297
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,040
general engineering education

298
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,480
sdn isp cloud jeff houston came up a lot

299
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,040
how many nate how many times this topic

300
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,120
was requested on the surveys

301
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,600
and uh so those are the ones that were

302
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,120
requested more often are here on the

303
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,920
left

304
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
and then here on the right the ones in

305
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
blue are more how many times we have

306
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,279
accepted these presentations how many

307
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,040
times they have gone live at nanak

308
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,160
so we have things like dns bgp and ddos

309
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
so for example here on the on the right

310
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,440
hand side we have had 44 talks on dns

311
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,760
and eight times dns has been requested

312
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,880
on the surveys

313
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,120
and here on the left we've had 40

314
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,360
requests on the surveys for automation

315
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,079
and only 26 times have we presented

316
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,760
talks on automation

317
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,440
and then what we've done down here is

318
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,000
cross-reference those references to how

319
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,200
many times

320
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,800
talks on these subjects have been viewed

321
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,040
on youtube so if we look at say

322
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,200
for example this dns where we've had 44

323
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,160
talks

324
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,519
here there have been 27 000 those 44

325
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,320
talks have had

326
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,760
27 000 views on youtube

327
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,040
and if we look at something like

328
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,440
automation here where we've only had

329
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,600
26 actual presentations on automation

330
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,279
but those presentations have gotten on

331
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,040
the order of 70 000

332
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,920
hits on youtube and this is important

333
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,480
when

334
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,000
when we look at for people who are

335
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,440
trying to decide

336
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,200
what they want to do a talk on and the

337
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,720
idea here is that we want to have as

338
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,760
many people

339
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,120
be able to take advantage of this

340
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,000
amazing platform as possible

341
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,760
the problem is a lot of people would say

342
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,000
yes i am an expert in this thing i'm an

343
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,200
expert in dns i'm an expert in rpki

344
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,440
i'm an expert in segment routing how can

345
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,959
i say anything about any of these

346
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,720
subjects because the job that i do is

347
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,399
100 proprietary

348
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,000
i would never be able to say anything

349
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,160
about any of these subjects

350
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
because i can't tell people what i do

351
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,200
during my day job

352
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,120
and we understand that and i think the

353
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,200
idea here is is that we would encourage

354
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,160
people to say

355
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,399
take a look at these things understand

356
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,079
how often they're requested

357
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,760
how often we give presentations on them

358
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,440
and how many how much

359
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,279
interest they're getting on youtube and

360
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,680
say even just to do a 101 type

361
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,360
introductory class on this subject would

362
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
be a great way to get your feet wet with

363
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,160
nanog

364
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,000
but you can come and speak to us on the

365
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,360
nanox stage

366
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,200
on any one of these topics which really

367
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,959
will be wildly popular you'll get

368
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,320
thousands of hits on youtube

369
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,120
even after you have you know for years

370
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,839
after

371
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,480
you have done your presentation and be

372
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,480
contributed back be contributing back to

373
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,279
the community

374
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,920
and any one of these topics it's it'll

375
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,880
be popular

376
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,720
and you don't have to give away anything

377
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,560
that's proprietary about your company

378
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,240
if you just take it at the very base

379
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,560
level

380
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,720
and and present to us in kind of an

381
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,079
educational way

382
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,800
so we we really do encourage that so

383
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,200
just

384
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,959
for some further information about the

385
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,079
proof of concept of the past five years

386
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,839
if we take it as representative what we

387
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,160
understand is that 66 percent of the

388
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,839
presentations that we give at nanag were

389
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,760
on the top 20 subjects

390
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,480
there were 115 categories both in the

391
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,320
presentations that we've been given

392
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,880
and that were requested on the surveys

393
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,440
and it was

394
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,399
they matched up amazingly well as of

395
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,399
december 2020 the past five years of

396
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,040
talks

397
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,000
had gotten around a million views on

398
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,760
youtube with a total view count growing

399
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,120
around four percent per month

400
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,720
if if we

401
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,360
watched all of the talks and

402
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,959
presentations that had been given at

403
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,240
nanog

404
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,680
every day for eight hours a day it would

405
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,839
take almost eight weeks to get through

406
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:30,320
them

407
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,839
there was an amazing volume of

408
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,839
information out there it was a total of

409
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,839
550 presentations

410
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,720
357 individual speakers from 218

411
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
organizations

412
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,399
and 90 of our speakers only present one

413
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,920
or two times

414
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,480
so the top 20 speakers which is anyone

415
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,079
who presented three or more times

416
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,279
in five years gave 131 presentations or

417
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,959
24 percent of all manhood talks

418
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,560
so looking forward i wanted to first

419
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,519
give a huge thanks to jeff bartig anna

420
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,240
valsami

421
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,040
and valerie whitcop they took this

422
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,639
project from what was really just a

423
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,959
five-year proof of concept into

424
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,839
reality that we should be able to gather

425
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,680
this information for every talk that we

426
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,800
have information on

427
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,600
in nano's history and especially thanks

428
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,279
to the program committee for creating

429
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,000
this new

430
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,519
subcommittee that we have called data

431
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,160
analysis where this work is really being

432
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,880
uh has a lot of attention and is being

433
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,480
nurtured and i really thank the

434
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,120
program committee for providing the room

435
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,920
and the

436
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,320
sunlight that this project needs to keep

437
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,680
moving forward

438
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,760
so with regards to progress currently we

439
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,560
have around 1300 talks kind of recorded

440
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,519
and tagged

441
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,839
ultimately do the math we expect around

442
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,519
30 talks per nano

443
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,600
uh we sh we expect there to be around

444
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,000
2100 agenda item or items

445
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,160
um but the problem is the easy part is

446
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,440
done

447
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
one thing that that happened when we

448
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,639
started moving out of the proof of

449
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,199
concept

450
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,920
five year phase into the let's do all of

451
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,279
nanook phase

452
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,600
um anna and valerie who jumped right in

453
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,639
there and

454
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,320
rolled up you know the three we rolled

455
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,680
up our sleeves and said okay we're just

456
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,480
gonna do this

457
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,800
jeff bartig looked uh he knocked out of

458
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,639
the whole thing and said this obviously

459
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,920
needs to be automated

460
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,440
and came up with script to download a

461
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,040
bunch of stuff from youtube so

462
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,880
that made that part of it much easier

463
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,480
the problem is that

464
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,000
now that that part's done there's a lot

465
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,079
of stuff that is still on the agendas

466
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,199
that we obviously needs to be gone

467
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,399
through one by one

468
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,519
and that's where we're at right now

469
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,800
there's still a lot of heavy lifting

470
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,639
with us

471
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,519
um and so that that really brings us to

472
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,199
where we're at right now

473
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,440
we are in the midst of this project

474
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,800
there's a lot of heavy lifting left to

475
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,440
do but

476
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,120
while we're doing it we would love to

477
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,199

to

495
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,959
hear more about uh at nano conferences

496
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,680
and where this is live as input as you

497
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,320

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:19,839
serving

510
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,359
our community and even beyond this

511
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,439
as i mentioned before earlier at the

512
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,119
nanak website there's a button in the

513
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,599
upper

514
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,039
right hand corner that says feedback

515
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,280
you can pop in there ask any question

516
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,480
you can also go to

517
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,840
our contact page where you can send a

518
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,160
correspondence specifically to the board

519
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,200
to myself

520
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,840
or to other departments within nano

521
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,559
okay we'll give it a few more we're now

522
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,640
popping up around 55 responses

523
00:17:52,640 --> 00:18:00,320
again we appreciate the feedback

524
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,080
without this kind of feedback we can't

525
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,240
serve your needs so

526
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,520
um the vocal ones

527
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:15,840
we hear you

528
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,280
give it another 10 seconds and then i'll

529
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:29,840
shift to the next ball question

530
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:42,160
they're still rolling in

531
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:57,840
there's nothing like community feedback

532
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,600
okay i'm going to uh close this one down

533
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,678
and move on to our next question

534
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,840
ah they're still rolling in that's great

535
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,880
all right our next question are you

536
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,240
planning to attend

537
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,080
in person for nanag i guess that'd be 82

538
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,240
in

539
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
minneapolis

540
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,640
again we use this data in order for us

541
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,240
to get a clear feedback

542
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,720
on what our community is thinking

543
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,640
and we also in addition to this these

544
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,559
polls we have surveys if you can go and

545
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,919
fill out those surveys and give us

546
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,200
feedback about

547
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,640
um the conference and what you've

548
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,240
experienced um

549
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,720
what this really helps us understand is

550
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
what is the will and thought of our

551
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
community the more voices we hear the

552
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,360
more accurate picture we get

553
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,280
and understanding of what you're looking

554
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,720
for us

555
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,240
in terms of managing and running the

556
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,840
organization

557
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,640
currently up to 53 responses we had 104

558
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,559
in their previous one

559
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,120
again the more data we get the better

560
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,960
for us

561
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,080
actually even the better for you

562
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,360
okay i'm going to give this another

563
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,120
20 seconds and then we'll move on to the

564
00:20:49,120 --> 00:21:03,840
next poll question

565
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,879
okay i will move on to the next question

566
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,240

568
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,880
our community is um important to us and

569
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,080
we're going to get into more questions

570
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,960
you'll kind of get a little more

571
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,080
granular data

572
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,720

past year regarding um

588

589
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,600
our community and

590
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,679
the world as a whole and again we're

591
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,799
trying to get feedback

592
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,360
to help us understand more and more the

593
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:55,840

594

covet 19 vaccine

604
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,960
considering the state of the rollout

605
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,600
this is not surprising but we

606
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,320
need to ask

607
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,159
give it a little more time then we'll

608
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:05,840
