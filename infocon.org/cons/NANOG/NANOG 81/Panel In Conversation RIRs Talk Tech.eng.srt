would

50

possibly uh maybe tell us one thing

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,320
unique about the ira that you represent

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,720
maybe something that uh

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,119
is distinct maybe something interesting

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,439
maybe something good maybe something bad

55
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,079
uh maybe something new uh whatever you

56
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,439
can think of off the top of your head

57
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,719
would be happy to hear it so i'll start

58
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,680

opportunity of doing this panel

and thank you for being a part of nano

64

which is

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,200
a conference an event and community i've

66
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,160
looked up to

67
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,200
for many years actually my name is

68
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
carlos martinez i

69
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,080
i'm based in montevideo uruguay i'm the

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,440
chief technology officer for

71
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,400
lucknick landing is the area responsible

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,120
for

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,160
uh latin america and parts of the

74
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,840
caribbean uh we share

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,840
the caribbean in a strange way to say

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,400
something

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,840
uh with uh my friends from irene

78
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,959
um something unique about lucknick

79
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,480
well i i think there are a couple of

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,319
things that i

81
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,560
think make lagning a bit different

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,680
lagning is one of the

83
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,800
younger rirs

84
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,440
began operations in 2002 it actually was

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,840
actually incorporated as an organization

86
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,159
uh in 2002 it's rather young

87
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,440
and the other thing that i think makes

88
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,599
us a bit different is that we

89
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,000
conduct business in three different

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,959
languages which

91
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,400
always presents interesting

92
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,200
sets of challenges when trying to breach

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,640
parts of our community we have a

94
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
significant part of our community

95
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,360
which speaks portuguese our brazilian

96
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,519
brazilian membership

97
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,560
we have obviously spanish community

98
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,480
and all we also have some english

99
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,319
speaking countries in our

100
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,959
region like belize and trinidad and

101
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,959
tobago for example

102
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,680
so i think that makes uh different in a

103
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,000
way

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,599
uh in in a way interesting

105
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,480
because uh actually have had the

106
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,360
opportunity of

107
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,920
visiting places and meeting folk that

108
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,040
otherwise

109
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,120
i would never probably been there like

110
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,640
that for example the

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
the netherlands netherland islands in

112
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,040
the caribbean which is

113
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,478
quite interesting that's very good

114
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,478
next in my window george if if you would

115
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,478

routing registry

124
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,639
rpki rdap um

125
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,800
we also we have quite an interesting

126
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,560
structure here in ap nick we're a

127
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,000
federal structure with national

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,919
registries and so i'm in charge of the

129
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,840
technical liaison function for those

130
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,120
guys as well

131
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,520
and we also do back end tier 2 support

132
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,479
for the frontline service delivery

133
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,880
as you can tell i'm a british australian

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,280
i've been here about 34 years and 20 of

135
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,680
them

136
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,039
i spent working in the rir system so

137
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,759
ap nick we were the second regional

138
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,840
internet registry to come into existence

139
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,840
after the ripe ncc

140
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,880
we've got about 56 economies in our

141
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,479
membership

142
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,320
we have this more complex structure than

143
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,240
a lot of nano members might be used to

144
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,280
with aaron and

145
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,039
ripe and afronic because we have that

146
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,280
pre-existing national structure

147
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,840
four of them in fact were founders of ap

148
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,479
nick

149
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,440
that's jp nick k nick t w nick and c and

150
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,960
nick and three have formed since

151
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
18 that came into being that's vienna

152
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,840
nick id nick in indonesia and erin in

153
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,199
india

154
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,479
we've got about um somewhere around 20

155
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,680
000 participating asset holders internet

156
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
number resource holders in our

157
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,240
region and it's pretty much 50 50

158
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,880
between

159
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,720
direct membership and the members of the

160
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,919
national internet registry

161
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,919
something that people might not realize

162
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,520
about the asian footprint is that we

163
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,360
have a much more complex structure now

164
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,759
we've been checking industry subtypes

165
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,759
and classic isp telco mobile

166
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,800
it's actually only about 30 35

167
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,360
of our overall membership a lot more

168
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,840
direct ownership of addresses is now in

169
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,800
fintech

170
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,880
or in the data center that's probably

171
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,240
amazon the content holders those guys

172
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,880
government related service people who

173
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,919
have no

174
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,840
core routing knowledge maybe holding

175
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,759
asset and relying on other people to do

176
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,039
the routing for them

177
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,680
and that's made for a bit of a change in

178
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,840
how we think about service delivery

179
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,520
because we're not dealing with people

180
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,919
all the time who are in the classic

181
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,160
nog community we're dealing with people

182
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,000
who have to have one of these

183
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
weirdo internet numbery things but they

184
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,319
don't actually know what to do with it

185
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,240
and it means we've kind of shifted some

186
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,240
of our service focus a bit

187
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,639
anyway that's enough about me that's

188
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,759
fascinating

189
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,039

so my name is felipe i'm the chief

194
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,280
operations officer

195
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,360
at the ipcc i'm responsible for

196
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,919
registry operations which includes all

197
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,120
the management of

198
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,280
internet thermal resources and also

199
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,080
software development activities which

200
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,240
include things like

201
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,759
rpki who is routing registry

202
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,680
and all the internal software as well

203
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,440
like the lr portal

204
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,560
rage to software and so on

205
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,039
uh the rypncc is the original internet

206
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,479
registry for

207
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,919
europe middle east parts of central asia

208
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,120
and russia which makes us quite

209
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,720
a diverse rer

210
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,039
with many different cultures

211
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,120
participating

212
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,720
which brings its uh own challenges

213
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
from the point of view of the

214
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
geopolitical challenges

215
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,319
uh and so on um we are

216
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,520
the oldest uh rar i think were founded

217
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:07,919
in

218
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,960
1992 and

219
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,240
uh we have uh at around uh 20

220

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,679
engineering operations within

229
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,320
within there so whether it's development

230
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,519

the dod neck

237
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,399
and in 1992 i remember this guy named

238
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,240
daniel carenberg from this organization

239
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,959

come over and say hey i want to start

241
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,399
actually

242
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,000
pulling data from you guys because i

243
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,560
want to run a registry in

244
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,800
dealing with with europe and i was like

245
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,640
oh this sounds really cool okay let

246
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,800
let's see what we could do and a little

247
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,399
bit later there's this guy named

248
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,640
david conrad who did the same thing for

249
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,760
ap nick

250
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,480
so so it was uh i basically i've been on

251
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,519
the ground floor of this since 1991

252
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,320
i helped put aaron together in my spare

253
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,040
time

254
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,800
uh after hours while i was working for

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,480
rare sign i would come over and help set

256
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,080

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,440
working for air

259
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,279

264
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,160
to afronic today um actually it's my

265
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,000
first time participating to nano

266
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,120
and i'm i've always been on the

267
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,760
on the mailing list um but now uh it's

268
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,399
good to be

269
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,760
uh live basically uh so afric

270
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,760
uh as you know is the youngest rio we

271
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,360
established business i think in 2005

272
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,720
uh and uh obviously we got

273
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,320
help from uh our friends the all other

274
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,640
rios to to set up our operations and

275
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,399
we are quite thankful for that as well

276
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,079
um uh

277
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,120
what else from our predictors we

278
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,279
might be one of the lost rios to still

279
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,560
have rpv4

280
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,160
uh i think just over two million

281
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,360
uh addresses remaining uh which we think

282
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,079
will be depleted soon um

283
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,279
right now we are in a phase called

284
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,680
a soft landing phase phase two actually

285
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,200
of the soft landing phase where we are

286
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,839
only

287
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,120
allocating very small pieces of ipv4

288
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,600
um i myself work in the research

289
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,880
department so i'm

290
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,920
leading data analytics projects and also

291
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,440
doing research

292
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,880
on many different aspects of the

293
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,959
internet from rpki to

294
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,079
uh performance to security uh

295
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,399
yeah that's about it thank you john okay

296
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,000
thank you amish i wonder if uh by

297
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,560
mentioning

298
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
you have ipv4 you'll see an influx of

299
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,079
some new potential

300
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,640
members and customers coming towards you

301
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,360
let's see

302
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,839
but i i want to remind you and the

303
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,040
audience here that

304
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,880
what i think we'll find too as we

305
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,560
broadcast this those who are watching

306
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,800
this know that this isn't live

307
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,000
um that there'll be people from not only

308
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,440
the north american region the the

309
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,880
typical man out of attendee but

310
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
but we've seen an additional influx of

311
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,079
people from all over the world so it'll

312
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,040
be good

313
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,120
for them to not only see their own uh

314
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,560
irs represented but

315
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,399
those who they they want to interact

316
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,680
with as well

317
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,760
okay so i'm going to start firing off a

318
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,360
few questions i'll try to get in a few

319
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,720
i'll try to make it equitable to get

320
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,760
around to everybody

321
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,320
you feel the interrupt or bring

322
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,200
something up if

323
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,040
if you want to add something of course

324
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,200
i'll target one person in

325
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,360
particular but we'll try to go around

326
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,560
robin more or less

327
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,160
in some worldly fashion we

328
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,880
probably have about maybe 20 or so

329
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,519
minutes

330
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,839
i don't want to monopolize the time and

331
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,839
trespass on the time when i hope will be

332
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,279
some good follow-up questions by the

333
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,560
live q a when this

334
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,959
when this does get broadcast on the day

335
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:19,760
of the

336
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,720
conference so let me start with you

337
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,320
george you'll be the lucky contestant

338
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,360
number one

339
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,160
um it's one of the things that people

340
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,680
maybe know a little bit less about is

341
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,079
how

342
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,800
of you i assume you all know each other

343
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
reasonably well or

344
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,240
the colleagues of each other reason be

345
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
well

346
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,160
and you have ways i assume of working

347
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,440
together and cooperating and one of

348
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,720
those ways i think

349
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,079
is through the nro what is the nro

350
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,000
so the nro is the

351
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,480
collective entity that was formed by the

352
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,440
individual

353
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,920
rirs to give some coherence and cohesion

354
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,120
to provision of service and application

355
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,440
of policy under a regional structure

356
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,000
we are all independent bodies all the

357
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,079
rirs are independent and we're really

358
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,320
quite fiercely independent we respect

359
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,079
our local members priorities and

360
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,200
preferences

361
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,279
i've had the luxury of going to other

362
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,800
rir meetings

363
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,839
boy they are feisty in ways you wouldn't

364
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,000
expect there's kind of local issues but

365
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
there is of course that global

366
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,760
address policy context and there's

367
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,680
global alignment issues

368
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,360
facing things like the istar ietf

369
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,320
icann you know interactions across that

370
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,399
space it's useful to have a converged

371
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,200
body

372
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,399
and we did a lightweight

373
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,320
construction here rather than making a

374
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,560
heavyweight body that sat on top of us

375
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,320
and had its own infrastructure and had

376
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,079
its own costs it's a

377
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,639
really small secretariat function it's

378
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,959
pretty much one or two people a general

379
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:53,600
manager

380
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,959
um herman who operates from ap nick's

381
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,199
territory he actually worked in lac nick

382
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,959
for years and years he's been involved

383
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,480
in more than one region

384
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,399
and we have a communications specialist

385
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,639
who works in us i think from memory that

386
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,199
also may now come from the lac region

387
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,959
but it has been someone from the ripe

388
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,600
region and we kind of carve up delivery

389
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,360
of functions between us

390
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,920
so for a while a converged statistics

391
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,839
and delegation report was being made in

392
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,240
ap

393
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,320
nick there were some issues in the

394
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,639
software control process and reflections

395
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,920
of how that worked for different

396
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,720
registries

397
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,120
that job moved to the ripe region and

398
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,800
they've done a huge reinvestment

399
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,199
implementing the design and the delivery

400
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,360
of a converged statistics report for the

401
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,240
nro

402
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,920
so things like that happen and we

403
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,720
operate working groups by function we

404
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
have an engineering coordination group

405
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,000
it's the one we all talk

406
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,440
in we meet at um ietf meetings typically

407
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,160
and we have an

408
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,560
annual offside where we coordinate a

409
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,360
worksheet

410
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,760
and that's helped us deliver things like

411
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,480
rdap

412
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,040
the new json format for the same data

413
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,760
and who is and to deliver convergence in

414
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,560
our services across things like rpki

415
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,440
and also to converge the delivery of how

416
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,839
we communicate key messages in address

417
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,000
management out to the wider community

418
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,680
but we have a communications working

419
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,839
group and the registry services working

420
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,399
group

421
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,360
they've been looking at a thing called

422
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,519
ithi

423
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,079
which is internet health measurement

424
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,760
something an initiative that i can

425
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,480
started

426
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,160
and we've taken that on board and are

427
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,480
now looking into our data services

428
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
to reflect the same kind of thing so

429
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,680
it's a lightweight

430
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,959
small coordinating body and we just seem

431
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,639
to make it work it's really pretty

432
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,480
effective

433
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,079
okay that seemed like a pretty complete

434
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,519
answer but if anyone else has anything

435
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,279
to add feel free to

436
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,560
chime in hey marish

437
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,160
let me ask you a question there was a

438
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,240
interesting report that came out of

439
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,320
your irr recently this who is uh audit

440
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,519
what was this all about what can you

441
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,040
tell us about that why was it and why

442
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,160
was it interesting noteworthy

443
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,079
yeah indeed um uh so

444
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,320
uh recently so afrenic published a

445
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,240
report called the who is

446
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,199
accuracy report uh it's basically an

447
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,240
audit that

448
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,759
uh afferent carried out um so the audit

449
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,920
started a couple

450
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,680
of months ago when there was some um

451
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,720
alleged fraud uh of ibf e4 so ipv4

452
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,920
were misappropriated and basically

453
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,360
um somewhere in 2019

454
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,079
basically the fbi conducted the supreme

455
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,759
court of mauritius where afrinic is

456
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,440
based to

457
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,480
to start um an invis an investigation

458
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,160
based on um some complaints that they

459
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,920
receive um from from researchers

460
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,600
uh in the us so this is where affinic

461
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,959
started the

462
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,759
uh a full full on audit and actually

463
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,720
discovered that

464
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,920
uh there was uh indeed misappropriation

465
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,320
of

466
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,199
actually before uh agrispace and

467
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,439
unfortunately this was done

468
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,599
uh by a former uh afrinic employee

469
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,720
who actually had host master rights so

470
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,280
that person was able to access the

471
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,839
database

472
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
um

473
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,760
in an unauthorized fashion um

474
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,439
unfortunately

475
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,880
um yes so

476
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,000
this ip audit enable us to

477
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,039
understand which ip address space

478
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,880
were allocated to organizations

479
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,840
without having a proper we call it a

480
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,600
registration service agreement with

481
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,200
afrinic and without having

482
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,039
any trail of tickets being open

483
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,280
and so on and so forth and we have also

484
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,640
seen that

485
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,160
a lot of the uh space

486
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,919
that were misappropriated were actually

487
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,600
doomed space so they were not even

488
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,039
appearing on the routing table

489
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,600
so they were either in the african pool

490
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,520
in the available athletic pool or they

491
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,080
were

492
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,600
legacy space um so legacy space as you

493
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,240
know

494
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,160
space that have been allocated to

495
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,360
organizations

496
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,600
prior to the establishment of the arrio

497
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,039
system

498
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,039
and some of them are used some of them

499
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,640
on the queues uh

500
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,640
so um they were part of the

501
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,880
space that were actually uh misused

502
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,480
so the the report um is to create some

503
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,679
transparency around

504
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,480
uh the events what what happened and

505
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,280
what are the

506
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,240
the next steps in terms of strengthening

507
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,200
access to

508
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,160
to the database and um improving the

509
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,799
process

510
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,520
uh so that such things do not happen

511
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,720
again

512
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,679
yeah i hope people who haven't checked

513
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,160
it out check it out i think it was

514
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,640
something very valuable and i think the

515
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,360
community

516
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,600
owes you a bit of gratitude for

517
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,799
producing that i think it was very

518
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,120
interesting

519
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,919
carlos except for america i suppose who

520
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,640
still has some ipv4 addresses

521
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,200
i think there was a time years ago when

522
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,240
uh that that

523
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,280
run out was imminent uh for most of us

524
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,559
that some people questioned what are the

525
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,760
irs going to do they're not going to

526
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,039
have any more addresses to deal out

527
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,120
there what's their job going to be

528
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,000
so now that the the v4 exhaustion is

529
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,919
pretty much complete

530
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,000
is has your work changed are you doing

531
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,120
less can you

532
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,720
can you just sit back and relax now

533
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,480
what's happening

534
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,799
what's changed about the role now that

535
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,960
you don't have before addresses

536
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,320
that's that's a very interesting

537
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
question right right now i would say

538
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,440
i i cannot say that our work has changed

539
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,320
or actually gone down in any way i think

540
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,400
we are working more than ever

541
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,679
uh although it's true that it's too

542
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,039
early in the

543
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,960
usa run out process to actually

544
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
to actually tell because we are still

545
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,240
seeing some

546
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,640
allocations uh we have this waiting list

547
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,440
uh we

548
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,960
are still doing some might be before

549
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,559
locations out of

550
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,400
uh recovered space revoked space and um

551
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,440
and some um allocations that were being

552
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,480
analyzed before

553
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,760
the actual uh run out people are

554
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,360
requesting more ipv6 which is

555
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,000
interesting

556
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,880
i just uh i was really early today i was

557
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,880
reading a report by

558
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,559
uh jeff houston from ipedic

559
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,520
which details the registry operations

560
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,640
for all their irs

561
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,679
in 2020 and actually i was

562
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,600
very surprised to see that lagning was

563
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,880
the rail that assigned

564
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,159
most had the most richest three

565
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,320
allocations performed on ipv6 not

566
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,400
necessarily the biggest space

567
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,880
but the individual registry operations

568
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,400
uh lagne was the

569
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,480
railroad that made the most allocations

570
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
of ipv6 in 2020

571
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,480
which was rather you know

572
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,799
surprising in an interesting way um

573
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,520
we are seeing a lot of demand for our

574
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,919
other type of services for example rpki

575
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,200
rpki has

576
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,559
usage has been growing a lot

577
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,039
during the past two years and it's right

578
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,840
now this actually demanding

579
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,559
a lot of engineering effort from my team

580
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,640
we have an interesting historical

581
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,000
anomaly in lagnik we didn't operate

582
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,440
a routing registry for historical

583
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,120
reasons i'm not exactly sure i tried to

584
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,320
research why

585
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,360
it was that way but lagning was the only

586
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,280
rir that didn't operate the routine

587
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,480
registry and a couple of years ago we

588
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,640
decided to do something about that

589
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,480
and we are now operating a

590
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,280
simplified i would say routine registry

591
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
that basically feeds

592
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,799
or creators synthetizes our psl objects

593
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,000
out of rpki information and that has

594
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,880
that has seen a lot of uptake in usage

595
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,480
and

596
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,080
um again we are facing another another

597
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,120
challenge that we

598
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,480
which is um providing these services

599
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,400
across the region because we also have

600
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,720
some

601
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,280
nirs and we have the challenge of

602
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,080
integrating

603
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,039
uh these services across not only our

604
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,960
own membership but the membership of the

605
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,919
nis which

606
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,280
presents its own set of challenges uh we

607
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,480
recently

608
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,840
for example um a year and a few months

609
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,158
ago

610
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,679
we started providing um in coordination

611
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,720
with nick brazil

612
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,159
rpki services for uh for the

613
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,679
membership in brazil um

614
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,080
and we've been working with our friends

615
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,559
in mexico for providing rpka in mexico

616
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,039
as well

617
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,720
and right now for the last

618
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,960
year and a half i would say we've been

619
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,440
finally able to provide our pka service

620
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,640
throughout the region and uh

621
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,880
yeah i i have the feeling that we are

622
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,280
working more than ever

623
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,240
eventually i i think i believe things

624
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,120
will

625
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,760
probably settle down at some point but

626
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,240
uh

627
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,840
probably not in the in the next few

628
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,000
years i'm not so sure that's true but

629
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,880
i'm glad you're busy

630
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,880
can i come in there john of course so

631
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,039
i think carlos is hiding his his light

632
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,799
under the bushel because he's actually

633
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,799
been doing a huge amount of work doing

634
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,960
development work as well he's got an

635
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,600
activity that's about network security

636
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,280
that lachnik does

637
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,600
building capacity inside his community

638
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,440
to have better resilience against the

639
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,000
attacks they're doing amazing work there

640
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,640
he's been funding development of code in

641
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,120
rpki that's become really significant in

642
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,080
our footprint

643
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,640
and it's kind of it's not a competition

644
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,559
but it kind of is a competition between

645
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,640
us for instance aaron did heaps

646
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,760
and heaps of work specifying api

647
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,600
bindings for service delivery for

648
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,679
members using rest and json

649
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,120
we've been looking at that and we're

650
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,960
thinking wow how can we leverage things

651
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,679
from that

652
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,480
ripe ncc they did all the groundwork

653
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,240
developing

654
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,320
rpsl-based systems and their engine of

655
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
running that whois service and routing

656
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,120
registry

657
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,200
we got hold of that and operate a fork

658
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,520
of that code i think afronick are using

659
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
parts of that code as well so we all

660
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,559
kind of

661
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,159
leverage tech off each other like carlos

662
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,320
our actual transactional work with

663
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,840
holders of addresses

664
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,799
just hasn't gone away and it's kind of

665
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,640
two-faced there's the part which is we

666
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,440
have a huge

667
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,520
legacy of holders that have basically

668
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,360
not kept data up to date

669
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,600
it might not be entirely the same in

670
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,360
aaron but they have the

671
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,240
lrsa and they have all of that pre-aaron

672
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,840
registry state

673
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,919
we've got a similar story in fact aaron

674
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,159
did an amazing job of helping all of us

675
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,840
the second comers get

676
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,159
that data and incorporate it a lot of

677
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,320
that data is very old

678
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,240
and so there's a kind of job there

679
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,159
keeping those records up to date

680
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,960
the other thing is no isp wants to

681
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
terminate the abuse phone calls when

682
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,200
someone says what is that ip doing on my

683
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,520
house and they're all building customer

684
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,840
more specific records about who's really

685
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,799
using

686
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,720
the the information we don't have a

687
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,240
mechanism like swip

688
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,159
so or our who is so there's a whole

689
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,080
bunch of transactional work in ap

690
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,880
nick keeping on top of how do i document

691
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,960
the real users of the resource

692
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,559
who are live in the network it's more

693
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,000
than just bgp

694
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,240
and that's a lot of help desk work and a

695
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,400
lot of human interaction work

696
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,760
so yeah we still all have jobs well i'm

697
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,720
glad you said that

698
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,440
and i i was a leading question i i know

699
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,200
that you guys are more than

700
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,679
busy this is an opportunity for you to

701
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,039
tell everyone else how much your actual

702
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,799
work you're doing i knew rpki was one of

703
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,000
those things and i'm glad you brought

704
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,840
that up

705
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,279
that was actually maybe one of my

706
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,520
questions i'll ask you felipe is

707
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,960
what are the the things that's come up

708
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,159
from time to time i think in a few of

709
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,440
the different regions

710
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,200
um and there's a couple on a few of the

711
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,960
different mailing lists

712
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,320
is the um is the

713
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,679
because each irr is it is a trust anchor

714
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,520
and uh you know act independently as a

715
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,799
as a trust anchoring

716
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,919
and the processes behind how you run ap

717
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,640
care i think people are still trying to

718
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,880
um better understand maybe maybe you're

719
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,320
trying to also better implement

720
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,880
so tell us a little bit about maybe um

721
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,760
the process

722
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,279
of um how you how you may do

723
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,120
testing verification um

724
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,720
and and maybe something about how uh

725
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,039
roads get pushed out what's that what do

726
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,640
those processes look like

727
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
maybe from going back a little ways and

728
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,760
where are we headed

729
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,919
what how are the how are the irs moving

730
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,679
in in that direction to

731
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,279
really improve the rpki

732
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,559
yeah it's a very good question and i'm

733
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,559
taking a hook from uh what carlos said

734
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,760
before

735
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
since a couple of years ago we have been

736
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,799
experienced a

737
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,919
very huge growth in rpi

738
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,520
uh usage within our region

739
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,159
so i did some homework for the sessions

740
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,440
i got some numbers

741
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,520
so just to get some ideas it took us

742
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,840
eight years to go from zero uh to ten

743
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,200
thousand arrows

744
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,720
so from 2011 until june

745
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,080
2019 and then took one and a half years

746
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,600
to double that amount

747
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,360
and we can see that over the last two

748
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,039
years that you can see this

749
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,879
huge exponential growth

750
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,200
and because of that experience more

751
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,240
pressure

752
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,279
to operate trust anchor not only in

753
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,080
terms of

754
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,360
availability uh resiliency and so on

755
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,679
but also in terms of integrity like the

756
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,360
integrity of the trust anchor

757
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,279
and the integrity of our processes

758
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,840
so since uh mostly beginning of last

759
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,279
year when we got

760
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,559
some funding secured from our

761
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,320
board uh we have been working uh harder

762
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,480
in terms of increasing the the

763
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,440
resiliency

764
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,720
and the security of our trust anchor uh

765
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,240
so we're running a project that is

766
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,640
calling uh rpk residency

767
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,480
and one of the things that we are doing

768
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,159
is uh defining

769
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,679
an audit framework uh for rpki

770
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,640
we're partnering partnering with a third

771
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,000
party

772
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
which is called a brief standards

773
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,200
institution

774
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,440
and together with them we're defining a

775
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,480
sock 2

776
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,000
type 2 audit report and the idea with

777
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,320
that

778
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,919
is that you can have relevant controls

779
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,520
uh for how to audit uh our internal

780
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,880
processes

781
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,640
uh sorry in the middle of this process

782
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,960
today like tailoring made

783
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,640
this kind of report and then later

784
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,880
this year we're going to hire another

785
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,760
company

786
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,840
that is going to actually uh audit us

787
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,919
that's one of the initiatives that we

788
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,760
had last year we have

789
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,880
many others in place another challenge

790
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,080
that we have in terms more

791
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,039
of infrastructure we run most of our

792
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,720
user infrastructure

793
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,080
in our data centers in amsterdam but

794
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,760
if you really want to be highly

795
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,240
available we want to leverage data

796
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,039
centers

797
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,200
all across the world so we're looking

798
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,799
into deploying uh

799
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,440
our infrastructure to the cloud so

800
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,039
looking mostly into aws

801
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,120
and how we can leverage on their

802
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,320
multi-region

803
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,320
infrastructure so in case of one of the

804
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,360
regions

805
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,559
is unavailable we can fail over to a

806
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,320
different region

807
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,399
but you also don't want to be fully

808
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,679
dependent on

809
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,120
a single cloud provider so we also want

810
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,159
to be able

811
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,559
to keep running the infrastructure in

812
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,919
our own data centers

813
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,399
so in case there is an unavailability

814
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,480
from the cloud provider we can also fail

815
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,279
over

816
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,480
uh to our own infrastructure and uh keep

817
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,279
running

818
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,000
from there does it fit just maybe a

819
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,279
question for all of you

820
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,039
perhaps um hopefully they maybe they'll

821
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,600
direct it to you since you just answered

822
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,480
do we first see the trust anchors in

823
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,679
particular

824
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,200
getting to a point where where the root

825
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,320
system for the dns is massively

826
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,799
scaled through things like anycast do we

827
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,720
anticipate something like that for trust

828
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,360
anchors

829
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,480
one day perhaps not so much for

830
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,279
mode but maybe even for for resiliency

831
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:37,760
from

832
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,240
security threats like a service attack

833
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,559
is that where we're headed you think

834
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,760
uh i'll sort of uh sort of chime in here

835
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,320
and yeah yes our repositories are things

836
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,080
that need to be highly scaled up

837
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,520
as we grow and and we're seeing growth

838
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,440
all of us are seeing growth on the

839
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,039
number of fetches that

840
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,679
are going across our infrastructures and

841
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,120
making sure that we're ahead of the

842
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,000
curve

843
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,120
and and uh someday we will be as

844
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,320
massively scalable

845
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,640
um maybe not to the extent that uh the

846
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,919
root servers are

847
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,279
um quite but it would be in a different

848
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:13,919
way

849
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,640
um but that is something that we are

850
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,120
looking

851
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,760
to do and are in the process of doing

852
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,720
actually

853
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,320
so i feel phillip a has actually been

854
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,360
working on

855
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,640
on stuff um growing things through

856
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,120
aws we've been working through google so

857
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,120
it just gives you sort of an idea

858
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,960
of the the sort of the the big

859
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,399
differences that we have but yet we're

860
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,480
all working on similar sort of ideas and

861
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,519
concepts

862
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,960
very good let's continue mark

863
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,240
you're you've been brought up in the

864
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,559
context of rdap what's the state of who

865
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,519
is in rdap

866
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,720
uh so uh who is is um

867
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
when you look at directory services in

868
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,760
general

869
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,919
um there's been lots of forays in this

870
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,080
space so who is has been a protocol

871
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,039
that's been around for

872
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,760
forever and basically you ask a queer

873
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,039
and you get back

874
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,240
response a very simple protocol and so

875
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,919
people have been using this for years

876
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:12,240
and

877
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,760
and one of the things that you don't get

878
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,279
out of it is like hey

879
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,320
where's this ip address 193 something

880
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,039
rather

881
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,360
where is that coming from and it's like

882
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,960
oh yeah that's in the right region how

883
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,240
do you know that

884
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,960
um and so one of the things that was

885
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,159
very early in the

886
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,919
process was this thing called a referral

887
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,440
who is saying well

888
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,120
we might not have the data but kind of

889
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,519
like similar mem

890
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,559
mirroring dns let's go ahead and show

891
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:38,880
you

892
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,399
where a better place to go to get that

893
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,559
information that didn't quite work out

894
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,840
as well as it

895
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,880
um it did but the latest foray in this

896
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,919
is actually using

897
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,120
basically a web version of of

898
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,000
of that sort of similar framework using

899
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,880
json

900
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,240
actually saying hey if i have the data

901
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,080
i'll give it to you if i don't have the

902
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,919
data i'll send a redirect so you can get

903
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,240
the data from a closer place

904
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,880
uh so that is work that's been underway

905
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,880
in the itf it's actually going through

906
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,600
the standards process now so there's

907
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,240
lots

908
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,640
lots of good forward progress on that

909
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,320
front not only from

910
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,200
the registries but also the domain

911
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,480
registries

912
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,360
so they're also very much involved in

913
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:21,919
this

914
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,440
so it brings on lots of new uh uh things

915
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,640
that actually people can

916
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,200
uh sort of leverage internationalization

917
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,080
being one

918
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,120
and another one being uh dealing with

919
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,440
pro

920
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,760
better ideas of privacy because right

921
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,480
now

922
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,880
anyone can see the data and who is and

923
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,559
there's no sort of security access

924
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,640
associated with it with art app you can

925
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,240
actually create those sort of access

926
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,000
controls if you wish

927
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,919
uh so so there's a lot more potential

928
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,279
there than we have

929
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,399
with our traditional whois service okay

930
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,080
again there's probably a couple of

931
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,279
follow-up questions to this go ahead

932
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,159
george

933
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,000
mark is kind of hiding his slide under

934
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
the bushel because a lot of the heavy

935
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,640
lifting

936
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,760
in that standards work got done by aaron

937
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,000
tech staffers they've taken a strong

938
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,399
lead in doing that core protocol

939
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:09,440
development work

940
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,280
i think it was a massive benefit to the

941
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,639
wider community

942
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,359
and we've all taken on board this idea

943
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,719
of converging

944
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,960
how we do things for various reasons who

945
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,040
is kind of fractured a bit and these

946
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,399
structural elements

947
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,639
of how we returned answers in who is

948
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,599
they just didn't

949
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,440
really quite line up we had different

950
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,440
language in our region to talk about

951
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,000
things

952
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,159
so if you're on the consumer side trying

953
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,480
to read and pass who is you're facing

954
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,159
that barrier they do it a bit different

955
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:36,960
in lac nick

956
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,918
aaron is not exactly like right coming

957
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:40,879
to our dap

958
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,879
we've got this golden opportunity to

959
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,320
come to some agreement

960
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,639
how do we tell you this is the asset

961
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,560
holder of the internet address

962
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,320
what's the structural element here in

963
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,879
json machine passable

964
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,040
it's really a golden moment for

965
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,359
improving that kind of service delivery

966
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,280
and those guys they did a lot of work to

967
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,640
get this right

968
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,440
so the other thing is for reasons that i

969
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,359
still don't understand

970
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,200
aaron they terminate like 50 or 60

971
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,440
of all the queries in rdap and then they

972
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,560
have to say oh

973
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,480
no that's not with us you've got to go

974
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,240
over here so even though there's a

975
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,359
global steerage file right up in the top

976
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,599
aaron is still having to do a lot of the

977
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,760
traffic management to get the queries to

978
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,560
us

979
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,240
it's just weird yeah yeah so so we

980
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,400
share numbers from time to time and what

981
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,440
george is saying

982
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,760
the numbers that we see are are quite

983
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,079
high

984
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,839
so it's uh we see 1800 queries per

985
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:40,480
second

986
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,000
across our directory services

987
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,599
constellation uh

988
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,160
just gives you an idea of of the scale

989
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,599
that we're dealing with

990
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,839
um and it's more than just one site we

991
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,520
have a three sites right now

992
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,240
um and in each site those aren't udp

993
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,720
query

994
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,040
dns queries those are no those are tcp

995
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
queries and yeah

996
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,119
and and actually the queries themselves

997
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,240
are quite complicated

998
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,880
it's not it's not a hash sort of

999
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,200
response that can go back off of queries

1000
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,520
and it's it's it's of course https it's

1001
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,720
encrypted http

1002
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,440
complex json it's it's rather heavy it's

1003
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,839
not a simple udp packet

1004
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:21,760
so it looks easy from the user side and

1005
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,079
we're all going to be very grateful from

1006
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,040
a tool building perspective this you

1007
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,920
mentioned or someone

1008
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,680
mentioned this idea of privacy are

1009
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,000
is there a risk that that that goes too

1010
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,359
far there's a lot of complaints about

1011
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,000
who is privacy because of gdpr

1012
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,720
are are we gonna end up in the same

1013
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,680
position with

1014
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,400
address and asn uh direct information

1015
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,119
where

1016
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,480
you know where it's redacted for reasons

1017
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,200
that are

1018
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
unhelpful for various kinds of analysis

1019
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,480
investigation

1020
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,200
is is that a real risk that was its

1021
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,240
potential

1022
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,920
for that to be a risk i think we'd be

1023
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,280
wrong to say oh no no

1024
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,359
that couldn't happen because we face

1025
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:02,960
legal pressures i mean ripe in

1026
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,599
particular with gdpr but also aaron

1027
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,680
they've got ccpa the californian

1028
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,640
obligations

1029
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,720
we can be told in the regime the

1030
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,680
political

1031
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,000
economic environment we work in by an

1032
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,880
authority

1033
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,480
you have to change so there is the risk

1034
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,560
but the thing is one of the standards in

1035
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,640
rdap is the idea of using

1036
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,839
federated authentication oauth

1037
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,400
and if we go with that model and adopt

1038
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,920
that framework people who

1039
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,960
need to know law enforcement legal

1040
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,599
track and trace isps who need to do

1041
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,160
technical

1042
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,880
contact they can identify and it could

1043
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,800
be they identify in aaron

1044
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,119
and their token is usable inside

1045
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,359
aphronic or in ripe or in ap nic or

1046
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,240
laknik

1047
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,040
we can do that kind of federated

1048
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,000
authentication

1049
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,640
model and uncover the data that if

1050
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,560
you're just a casual user

1051
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,800
we kind of have obligations to hide so

1052
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,599
we do

1053
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,599
we know there's the potential for a loss

1054
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,359
of public view of this data

1055
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,200
but we're thinking ahead about ways we

1056
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,720
could maybe handle that

1057
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,800
respectfully because privacy is a pretty

1058
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,960
big deal some of the people who hold the

1059
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,160
dresses

1060
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,079
they're actually individuals they're not

1061
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,280
legal entities

1062
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,160
if you go into who is you don't see

1063
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,960
corpco

1064
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,680
in portland oregon sending you packets

1065
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,240
you see

1066
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,800
randy bush because he holds the assets

1067
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,079
as an individual

1068
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,920
and that's a pretty massive breach of

1069
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,599
privacy so

1070
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,839
we have to be careful about this you

1071
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,480
know

1072
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,880
thank you george let me we're we're kind

1073
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,400
of coming close to the end of our time

1074
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,240
here so let me ask uh one question for

1075
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,200
the group and then

1076
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,079
uh maybe one more kind of closing

1077
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,920
question

1078
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,839
i think it's quite clear and obvious

1079
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,599
that you all are working on

1080
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,119
some really cool stuff some of the

1081
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,720
future stuff like the rpk and some of

1082
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,839
the changes are adapted

1083
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,359
i think it's kind of fascinating and you

1084
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,800
and you do things maybe necessarily not

1085
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,839
strictly

1086
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,839
irr related than some cases i know but

1087
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,680
particularly does all kinds of stuff for

1088
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,078
instance

1089
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,040
what kind of opportunities might someone

1090
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,760
[Music]

1091
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,920
be appealed to working with

1092
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,119
your irr either full-time do you

1093
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,640
i don't know how big you are and how

1094
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,119
much hiring you do um but what sort of

1095
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,800
uh technical opportunities might there

1096
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,560
be this is your pitch to make

1097
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,000
for someone to maybe come apply to if

1098
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,440
you have open positions or maybe

1099
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,640
internships

1100
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,160
we have a lot of young people who are

1101
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,920
tuning into nana who wouldn't normally

1102
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,200
go who would probably be very interested

1103
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,839
in

1104
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,560
in helping do work for probably pretty

1105
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,000
free to help their

1106
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,400
way through college anything going on in

1107
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,880
that space i may uh john

1108
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,480
um so afraid has a what we call

1109
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,960
a research collaboration program where

1110
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,520
we

1111
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,200
we get in interns on board and uh

1112
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,320
for for three to six months and they can

1113
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,040
work

1114
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,480
on various subjects such as

1115
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,119
you know any engineering type of work or

1116
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,800
also

1117
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,640
in my department on research subjects

1118
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,200
we also do collaborations with the

1119
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,480
academic bodies

1120
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,680
so for example uh we we send out

1121
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,440
um some collaboration requests to

1122
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,800
to universities uh here on the continent

1123
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,720
requesting support on let's say we want

1124
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,720
to do we want to run internet

1125
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,839
measurement

1126
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,280
um activities let's say in congo dlc

1127
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,480
then we will

1128
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,640
reach out to the different universities

1129
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,000
there too to host

1130
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,359
for example ripe atlas anchors or probes

1131
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,160
and then we would um do the analysis and

1132
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,319
publish a report

1133
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,880
at the country level so this type of

1134
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,920
research work

1135
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,720
we like to collaborate with the students

1136
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,319
and uh

1137
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,839
yeah we have this program that we can

1138
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,400
take them on board

1139
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,640
that's great if i may as well do some

1140
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,560
sales pitch we're actually hiding at the

1141
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,040
moment

1142
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,119
because i have an opening for a devops

1143
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,280
engineer uh in rpki

1144
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,920
so if you want to help us to do all this

1145
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,680
cloud deployments

1146
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,319
uh feel free to apply and also a soft

1147
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:13,359
engineer

1148
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,960
and uh one of the things that we're

1149
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,599
planning uh to build that's

1150
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,119
quite excited about in the rpk island

1151
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,000
is a publication as a service because

1152
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,520
now with more and more people

1153
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,040
uh running a no no hosted rtki

1154
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,560
with krill there is a need

1155
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,720
for resilient uh repositories and

1156
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,920
instead of they're running their own

1157
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,800
repository

1158
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,520
they could publish the repositories uh

1159
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,359
within the the right pcc

1160
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,200
it's not uh it's on our roadmap

1161
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,960
something that we really want to build

1162
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,119
uh but yeah it's not uh it's not ready

1163
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,240
yet

1164
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,480
right maybe there'll be another opening

1165
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,720
yeah yes

1166
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,800
hopefully there is people from latin

1167
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,920
america

1168
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,319
watching this talk uh we are going to

1169
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,160
have two positions open in my team

1170
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,720
uh one software developer and one

1171
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,800
systems administrator

1172
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,520
and uh it can be quite challenging and

1173
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,200
quite fun working for lightning we are

1174
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,240
we are i would say a small team

1175
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,680
so the bad thing is you get a lot of

1176
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,599
work to do the good thing about that is

1177
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,880
you get to see and touch

1178
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,800
a lot of different technologies during

1179
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,079
your

1180
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,960
things at lagnik

1181
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,440
and it's definitely a very nice place to

1182
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,240
work at

1183
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,839
uh i'm biased of course but i highly

1184
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,480
recommend it

1185
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,440
mark you look like you want to say

1186
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,119
something yeah actually i just want to

1187
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,720
say that one of the things that's

1188
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,319
happening at aaron is that we realize

1189
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,079
that we need to give more focus to the

1190
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,079
community on some of our services that

1191
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,040
we have

1192
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,319
and so we just hired a product manager

1193
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,400
a senior project manager who's going to

1194
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,760
be taking care of

1195
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,640
routing security both rpki and irr

1196
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,599
services

1197
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,240
so you'll you'll be seeing a lot more of

1198
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:02,720
of

1199
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,000
people from aaron um in the future

1200
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,359
not just me but others um so so that you

1201
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:09,920
can uh

1202
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,240
so that people can see that we're hard

1203
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,599
at work trying to improve

1204
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:16,880
things um at aaron we have had in the

1205
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,240
past we've had interns

1206
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,079
uh work at aaron i'm not sure how well

1207
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,359
it's going to work this summer

1208
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,839
with us being in the sort of coveted

1209
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:24,560
environment

1210
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,319
and frankly our office we're all working

1211
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,000
remotely um

1212
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,520
and that's going to be a little bit

1213
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,280
challenging in the meantime but

1214
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,839
we're working through it okay very good

1215
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,160
george do you have a one last thing

1216
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,240
we've got a community trainer

1217
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,400
position open so if you're um

1218
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,920
technically adept and good at the

1219
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,520
communications and if you've got a

1220
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,680
language in use in the asian footprint

1221
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,599
we would love to hear from you

1222
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,240
we've done interns um works out pretty

1223
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,319
well australia is a nice place to be but

1224
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,319
as mark said this isn't exactly the

1225
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:57,839
right year for

1226
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,480
global travel we have some remote

1227
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,119
workers

1228
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,280
it can work but the time zone shifts

1229
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,240
between

1230
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,400
places that people are likely to be can

1231
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,079
be quite a substantial barrier

1232
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,200
for us i don't know that we're in a big

1233
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,200
growth phase at the moment but i suspect

1234
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,960
there'll be technical positions coming

1235
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,359
up

1236
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,160
and as a 20-year person in the rir i can

1237
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:18,560
say

1238
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,720
it's a great place to work so i

1239
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,160
definitely support

1240
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,400
people in your community in nanhog have

1241
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,079
a look at our job boards because it's a

1242
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,440
really nice place to be

1243
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,319
public interest work it's good stuff

1244
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,599
excellent

1245
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,240
okay let's let's end this way i'll kind

1246
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,920
of go in the reverse order this time to

1247
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,800
close

1248
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,319
i'll start with you american what i'd

1249
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,920
like for each of you to maybe

1250
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,160
make your last pitch what is it that a

1251
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,680
network operator who

1252
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,079
maybe from that or any other region who

1253
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:46,960
maybe wants to

1254
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,800
operate in your region what is it they

1255
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,079
need to know what what

1256
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,520
should they know about afernic and voice

1257
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,760
first of each one of you so

1258

so that you can get going with your

1279
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,400
v4 setup but we also would encourage you

1280
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,920
to add up ipv6

1281
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,960
and we have a dedicated team of

1282

deploy ipv6 or deploy rpki

1290
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,720

1306
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,640
uh based organization uh where isps um

1307
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,760
is our our members all the way

1308
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,319
down to individuals as george said that

1309
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:57,040
uh people

1310
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,960
like randy bush who's no longer in our

1311
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,960
region but was once in our region

1312
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,720
um have or we're members or our members

1313
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,599
and each of those members have a say and

1314
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,280
actually people in the community have a

1315
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,000
say

1316
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,680
so for example one of the things that we

1317
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,599
have is we have a

1318
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,680
uh suggestion process so if you see

1319
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,640
something that we

1320
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,640
need to be doing differently or better

1321
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,480
we have a suggestion process that you

1322
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,280
can go ahead

1323
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,319
and submit and we actually earnestly

1324
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,359
look at those and

1325
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,160
um and and work on them on these

1326
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,119
suggestions so

1327
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:31,680
so this isn't this sort of big registry

1328
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,720
in the cloud

1329
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,520
or registry out there that uh you know

1330
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,800
everyone has to deal with but it's kind

1331
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,000
of painful we try to we're

1332
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,520
making we're trying to be as customer

1333
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,000
friendly as we can and trying to

1334
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,440
uh try to achieve or uh

1335
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,440
keep on going with what the community

1336
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,760
wants us to do

1337
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,000
thank you mark and felipe what uh what

1338
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,400
the network operators need to know about

1339
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,000
the writer um yeah i think one thing

1340
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,760
it's interesting because they all have a

1341
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,319
technical background network operators

1342
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:03,440
software engineers

1343
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,119
and they tend to not give much attention

1344
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,040
to the more boring parts

1345
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,319
of the relationship with an rar which is

1346
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:12,079
keeping the information up to date

1347
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,000
giving all the necessary documents

1348
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,960
and so on uh and we do face a lot of

1349
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,599
challenges

1350
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:21,040
uh because of that so records are left

1351
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,599
not up to date and i'm talking about

1352
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,280
companies changing name we're going

1353
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,040
through mergers and acquisitions and so

1354
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,520
on

1355
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,240
and then we finding that out many years

1356
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,040
afterwards

1357
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,359
and then you have to go back and do all

1358
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,480
the paper trail

1359
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,079
and then that can be uh quite

1360
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,160
challenging uh to do

1361
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,520
so i know that network operators

1362
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,160
they tend not to care much about this

1363
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:44,960
but they'll say

1364
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,359
please please let us know when there is

1365
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,079
a change

1366
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,599
uh especially the legal structure of

1367
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,200
your company so you can

1368
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,160
speed up things it's much easier uh to

1369
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:54,880
update

1370
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,359
uh your account if you the change is

1371
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,000
fresh so it's much easier to get

1372
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,640
all the paperwork uh and the necessary

1373
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,880
signatures

myself

1435
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,000
actually helping them discover their own

1436
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,599
drugs in policies because they were very

1437
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:26,880
confused about their own

1438
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,160
policies and uh is that

1439
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,720
is that our way to of looking at things

1440
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,640
and we are happy to do that

1441
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,400
all right well thank you very much

1442
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,040

hopefully see you all for a little bit

1445
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,520
of q a i think i saved some of the

1446
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,280
hardball questions for

1447
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,640
the audience to ask you so i wouldn't

1448
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,880
get in trouble myself directly but

1449
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,119
i'll maybe uh help seed some of those if

1450
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,359
i don't see any pop up in the window

1451
00:51:55,359 --> 00:51:57,680
so thank you again we'll see you soon in

1452
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,960
the virtual

1453
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,280
uh or the uh the virtual nano with a

1454
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,800
live q a

1455
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,960
thank you everybody thanks john thank

1456
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,240
you everybody

1457
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,850
thank you very much

1458
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:13,179
[Music]

1459
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:17,119
that was absolutely awesome thank you

1460
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,559
gentlemen

1461
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,760
we don't have that much time for live q

1462
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,559
a

1463
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,319
so i've picked one out of the

1464
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,480
pile and i'm going to ask that we

1465
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,480
round robin through it and i believe

1466
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,640
that carlos is the first one to my right

1467
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,240
the question is is anything being done

1468
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,119
to enforce

1469
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,079
accurate information of contacts such as

1470
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:46,640
useful

1471
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,920
or working abuse addresses the comment

1472
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,760
was personally i encountered bad

1473
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,720
information

1474
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,559
when attempting to report malicious

1475
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,119
behaviors

1476
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,640
thank you alex uh yeah definitely um

1477
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,920
that is

1478
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,319
i would say two two things that uh we

1479
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:05,119
are wonking on

1480
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,960
and answering the question for lagnik

1481
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,240
specifically

1482
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,640
uh there is a policy that was uh

1483
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,839
approved and ratified

1484
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:17,280
early 2020 if i remember correctly

1485
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,079
that has to do with validating points of

1486
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:20,640
contact

1487
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,760
particularly i will use contacts and the

1488
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,319
idea is to

1489
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,800
actually ensure that those email

1490
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,119
addresses email inboxes are actually

1491
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,960
monitored uh the implementation of

1492
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,359
such a policy ended up being quite

1493
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:38,000
complex

1494
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,640
and i hope uh that it will be

1495
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,599
implemented

1496
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:44,079
um i mean we have a release date around

1497
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:44,800
march

1498
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,920
may and uh which it should be

1499
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,920
i mean to start growing the validation

1500
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,839
upon that point of time

1501
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,440
uh the other things that we've done in

1502
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,880
the past is that we

1503
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,000
created a dedicated incident response

1504
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,480
capability within lagnik and we have a

1505
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,680
scissors

1506
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,520
and the system can receive your

1507
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,240
incident reports and i can actually help

1508
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:08,839
you

1509
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:12,000
track some specific contact within the

1510
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,040
organization and

1511
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,200
if you are dealing with a particularly

1512
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,359
serious incident so feel free to contact

1513
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:18,640
them

1514
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,960
thank you can we move to george who's

1515
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,880
the next one over

1516
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,160
hi so like carlos we have

1517
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,680
a mandatory incident response contact

1518
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,200
policy we actually did work back in 2010

1519
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,599
to make this mandatory for all resource

1520
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:36,400
holders

1521
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,760
and we had a reaffirmation of this in

1522
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,520
2019 with the validation process that

1523
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,000
requires six monthly review

1524
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,160
but the the lived experience for

1525
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,839
everyone is that some of these people

1526
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,680
are simply non-responsive

1527
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,720
so we do have a reporting mechanism

1528
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,680
in our website if you're experiencing

1529
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,839
non-responsive abuse contacts and you've

1530
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,520
reached out to the isp

1531
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,079
we have a process that we can go through

1532
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:02,720
but

1533
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,960
there is also quite a large amount of

1534
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,000
acid held in our

1535
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,520
region that is before strong policy

1536
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,200
compliance came into being

1537
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,200
and there are people who have full use

1538
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,040
of their resources but who simply are

1539
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:15,520
not

1540
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,680
going to update their contact

1541
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,640
information

1542
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,040
and we don't have policies that allow us

1543
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,119
to reclaim because of non-contact

1544
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,119
ability like this it's not actually our

1545
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,359
functional role in region to do that

1546
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,520
but for most of the cases yeah we have a

1547
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,440
process and we're happy to work with you

1548
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,839
to keep this information up to date

1549
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,040
excellent thank you can we pass now down

1550
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,400
to felipe

1551
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,680
going clockwise

1552
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:46,319
uh yeah similarly to uh laknik we also

1553
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:47,280
have a

1554
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,520
abuse validation policy it was

1555
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,920
approved i believe a bit more than one

1556
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:54,720
year ago

1557
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,319
and we have been doing the the

1558
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,920
validation

1559
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,160
since early last year and the process uh

1560
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,760
semi-automated so we do part part of it

1561
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,920
using a software solution and we also do

1562
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,880
a follow-up

1563
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,400
manually uh using the the host masters

1564
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,799
uh on our initiative we want to extend

1565
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:15,680
that

1566
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,920
to all sorts of contacts so to do a

1567
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,440
similar validation

1568
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,480
uh to all kinds of contacts in the

1569
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,119
in the right stream uh we didn't decide

1570
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,280
yet exactly how but that's planned

1571
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,960
to be done this year

1572
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,760
thank you very much can we move now to

1573
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,760
mark

1574
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,559
sure so we've had puck validation for a

1575
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:39,119
long

1576
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,480
period of time um over 10 years and so

1577
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,559
we've been using that uh it's had

1578
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:47,680
a pretty good success there's been a

1579
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,799
number of people who have been

1580
00:56:49,799 --> 00:56:52,720
uncontactable much like what george has

1581
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,240
been talking about um

1582
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,079
but for the most part it's worked quite

1583
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,680
well so we've been

1584
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,000
working with keeping our data up to date

1585
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,319
based on our poc validation

1586
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:06,240
uh that's done on an annual basis

1587
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,040
thank you mark uh ambrish can you finish

1588
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,119
up the round robin and then we'll move

1589
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,960
on to our next uh

1590
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,000
presentation which is closing thank you

1591
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,480
alex

1592
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,839
uh yes indeed so maintaining uh

1593
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,160
updated information in you know with

1594
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,920
different databases

1595
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,839
is absolutely um important and uh

1596
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:30,880
we have quick process for the members

1597
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,359
contact update where periodically we

1598
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:34,160
will

1599
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,480
contact the members and make sure all

1600
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,359
the

1601
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:40,160
information in the database is actually

1602
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,440
accurate

1603
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,720
um uh in the past we have also had

1604
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,480
uh abuse abuse contact uh policies

1605
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,760
um and unfortunately they haven't been

1606
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,119
really uh i would say effective

1607
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,240
and efficient because currently they are

1608
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,000
not mandatory

1609
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,119
i know we have

1610
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,160
a new abuse contact policy

1611
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,599
that has been uh circulated um

1612
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,440
in our policy discussions uh at the

1613
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,680
moment which is still under discussion

1614
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,319
um uh unfortunately it hasn't reached

1615
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:18,559
consensus yet but hopefully

1616
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:21,599
um it will because it's i believe it's

1617
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,119
an important piece of work

1618
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:27,359
um so yeah thank you

1619
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,440
thank you very much henry uh gentlemen

1620
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,200
