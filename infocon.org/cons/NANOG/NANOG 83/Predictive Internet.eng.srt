00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,839
hello i'm jp vassar from cisco system

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,840
i'm a cisco fellow and head of

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,840
engineering for machine learning ai and

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,679
i'm delighted to tell you more about the

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,280
predictive internet

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,279
that's a very key topic for cisco we've

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,279
been working in this concept for about

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,240
three years and as you see it's not

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,640
just about concept we've been working on

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,359
it we have deployed many networks using

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,880
this technology

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,039
and will be more than happy to share

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,079
with you

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,040
many results uh in the next coming month

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,480
all right so let's step back a little

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,399
bit and talk about the internet of the

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,480
past 35 years

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,320
i do believe that

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,039
we did a really good job at

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,760
improving the ability for the internet

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,760
to be more reactive

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,920
so to that end we developed many

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,160
protocols algorithm

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,559
so that upon detecting an issue which is

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,520
usually

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,199
a path issue

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,280
the path goes down what we call

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,520
sometimes a dark layer

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,920
at multiple layers we can detect very

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,400
quickly that there was an issue and then

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,159
once we detect the failure we can

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,119
reroute the traffic on an alternate path

34
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,200
this alternate path may be computed on

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,240
the fly or it may be pre-computed we may

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,400
be using optical

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,720
network recovery technologies

38
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,680
ip technologies mpls technologies at all

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,880
layers we all know that fast igp

40
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,159
faster triggering of spf incremental spf

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,200
the use of

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,240
one hub

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,200
or multihub backup tunnels with nps

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,640
traffic engineering so to me you know

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,119
the ability to react very quickly is

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,439
almost a solve issue

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,520
but still will not learn and what i mean

48
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,240
by we're not learning is the fact that

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,880
you still wait until you have an issue

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,280
and then you react but you don't take

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,320
advantage of what happened in the past

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,479
and this is what we need to change

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,799
so this is why we we're introducing the

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,680
predictive internet concept and there's

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,759
a broad set of technologies coming with

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,719
it

57
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,639
so now if you think a little bit about

58
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,160
the human brain

59
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,400
the human brain is really about learning

60
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,800
by experience and this is what a baby

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,840
does by sensing the world

62
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,680
and the brain is actually a very

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,360
well-known predictive engineer it's a

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,520
fantastic predictive engine i won't go

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,920
there to discussing about what we call

66
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,640
predictive coding but you do a lot of

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,959
collection when you grab a cup of coffee

68
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,720
or when you you play tennis you know

69
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,480
it's all about prediction

70
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,239
and of course we do planning in the what

71
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,160
we call the prefrontal cortex but again

72
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,640
i won't go too much in there

73
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,599
what the creativity internet is about

74
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,319
is really about the same concept so i'm

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,879
not claiming that we will mimic a human

76
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,640
brain and all these things we are far

77
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,480
from doing that that's not the objective

78
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,599
either

79
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,360
but with the predictive internet what we

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,560
want to do

81
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,440
is to first of all build a model of a

82
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,840
world and the world in this case is

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,959
internet

84
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,560
and thanks to machine learning with a

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,599
rich set of telemetry you can accumulate

86
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,280
some knowledge you can start building a

87
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,080
model of the world and the internet at

88
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
multiple layers not just the routing

89
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,280
layers

90
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,840
and then you know if you can start

91
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,000
doing that you can start doing some

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
prediction as well

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,519
and what i mean by prediction is the

94
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,840
ability to anticipate issues before they

95
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,879
happen

96
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,159
and that's really about you know

97
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,840
predicting the future

98
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,840
and of course you can keep learning

99
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,840
thanks to something and science in this

100
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,959
case

101
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,599
is really about telemetry and figured

102
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,440
out that you may make some mistake when

103
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,040
you create the future

104
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,440
but you will accumulate some data points

105
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,080
so that you can start doing a better job

106
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,000
next time and of course you can do

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,239
planning and planning is of course about

108
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,760
automation

109
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,239
so these are very similar concepts again

110
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,000
the way it's being done in the human

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,840
brain and the internet will be very

112
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,599
different obviously

113
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,680
but the two are

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,159
in fact sharing a lot of they have a lot

115
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,080
of commonalities between the two all

116
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,120
right

117
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
so as i said what are the objectives of

118
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,840
a predicament the first one i keep

119
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,400
mentioning it is about being proactive

120
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,720
instead of being reactive

121
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,000
and i would say that they are

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,639
complementary of course you can't always

123
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,800
predict everything and by far i wouldn't

124
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
claim

125
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,759
that we can predict everything and so

126
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,520
you're going to combine the predictive

127
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,000
approach with the reactive approach

128
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,080
for all the issues that we call predict

129
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,120
it's not one or the other they will work

130
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
in concert together

131
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,919
the second concept that is even more

132
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,960
important i would say equally important

133
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,720
is really the fact that instead of

134
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,199
looking at a dark failure when basically

135
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,759
you have a loss of rooting adjacency

136
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,479
or you have a link that goes down

137
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,320
these are really the kind of failures

138
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,040
we've been dealing with for a long time

139
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,720
and i think that it's now time to look

140
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
at the architecture experience and the

141
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,759
user experience

142
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,000
and start to understand really

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,600
how we can get feedback from the

144
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,880
application

145
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,280
so that we can take that into account

146
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,080
when you do the best path selection

147
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,919
and then last but not least of course is

148
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,120
about this concept of trusted automation

149
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,440
and we keep talking about self-healing

150
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,199
networks we haven't done much as in

151
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,240
industry

152
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,560
but i do believe that once you can start

153
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,479
doing some really good prediction you

154
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,039
can feed that feedback into a close

155
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,520
control mechanism and do

156
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,759
the first step towards the selfie

157
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,160
network

158
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,120
okay so you know sometimes when i

159
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,880
presented this concept to people they

160
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,039
said okay you're trying to

161
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,560
uh engineer

162
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,120
you know within itp or across you know

163
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,520
the internet and do predict about what's

164
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,600
going on and that's not the goal at all

165
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,680
so i want you to be very clear on that

166
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,199
it's not about

167
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,840
igp traffic engineering becoming

168
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,319
predictive it's not about intra domain

169
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,639
collection for that we have many tools

170
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,560
we have mpls traffic engineering or to

171
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,039
battery or using the computation element

172
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,360
you can do offline igp metric

173
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
optimization knowing the traffic metrics

174
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,600
there are many many ways of doing that

175
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,039
that's not what what i call the

176
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,120
predicting internet it's not either

177
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,000
about

178
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,120
intel domain with bgp track engineering

179
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,000
for example make it predictive

180
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,520
that's not what i'm talking about what

181
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,039
i'm talking about

182
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,639
is the case where

183
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,800
you can have a look at multiple paths

184
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,919
across the internet and you can go via

185
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,560
mpls via internet you can

186
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,639
back all the traffic to the hub you can

187
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,039
send to direct internet access

188
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:41,840
so

189
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,000
the ability now

190
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,759
of a system to do

191
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,000
predictive path selections from the edge

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,319
of the network thanks to accumulated

193
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,599
telemetry

194
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,880
and then you can run the machine

195
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,280
learning algorithm to really choose the

196
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,919
best path in a predictive fashion and

197
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,240
not in a reactive fashion so that you

198
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,080
really understand the property of the

199
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,960
path

200
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,039
and what is expected from an application

201
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,840
standpoint and you can also make it

202
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,919
predictive at the same time and i really

203
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,039
believe

204
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,160
after

205
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,240
three decades in the network industry

206
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,680
that this is going to be a game-changer

207
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,319
so what have we done you know um

208
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,479
we've been working on the machine

209
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,319
learning against cisco for about a

210
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,919
decade

211
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,720
in many many areas going from security

212
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,280
to collab to the internet of things to

213
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,599
the sp backbone as well

214
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,800
and

215
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,560
we started off with

216
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,720
analysis and you can't

217
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,520
learn any model with a few thousands of

218
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,680
stuff you need to look at

219
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,599
hundreds of thousands and millions of

220
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,160
paths and that's exactly what we did

221
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,240
across 2000 service providers in the

222
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,120
world

223
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,280
so we spent a big chunk of time trying

224
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,680
to model this path and what i mean by

225
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,240
model it could be a statistical model it

226
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,720
could be machine learning models

227
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,039
but we wanted to understand the property

228
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,440
and the characteristics of those paths

229
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,000
we also looked at seasonal

230
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
aspects you know some parts maybe

231
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,680
seasonal this is a very interesting

232
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,879
property

233
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,599
we derived a bunch of advanced metrics

234
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,599
to really characterize the property of

235
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,759
the path with regards to an application

236
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,199
and syllabus

237
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,160
we also look at multiple paths across a

238
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,720
given pair of cities across multiple

239
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,039
timber systems to see if we could find

240
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,199
some clusters of path having the same

241
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,599
property and we did the whole modeling

242
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,120
on top of that

243
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,799
and that was you know it took some time

244
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,320
to do that it's a lot of default deep

245
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,799
amount of expertise so that we can

246
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,640
really characterize what's going on but

247
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
that was not sufficient

248
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,120
the next piece was really to look at the

249
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
the application slas

250
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
so here we all have a time it's a

251
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,720
lightning talk

252
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,160
but i'm happy to

253
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,440
point you to

254
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,519
our studies where we look at the the

255
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,800
viability of the mass core of the voice

256
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,720
we looked at billions of records not

257
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,279
even millions but billions of recalls so

258
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,000
that we truly understand the dynamics

259
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,240
and the most core so in this case i'm

260
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,560
just showing you a quick map

261
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
it's actually a video that goes on where

262
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,880
you can see the viability of the

263
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,120
percentage of course with a mass

264
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,800
coordinator for

265
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,200
and what you find out is that it varies

266
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,399
all the time

267
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,440
regardless in the region even within a

268
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,519
single day you see the high valuation so

269
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,240
what we did at cisco was to understand

270
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,920
the true sla of the application and we

271
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,839
did that for void but not only for voice

272
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,959
we did it for office 365 we did it for

273
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,839
multiple types of applications

274
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,480
now when you understand what's happening

275
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
in terms of application sla and you

276
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,399
truly understand the dynamics of a

277
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,440
network

278
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,600
and you have a large enough database you

279
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,399
can start designing a system that will

280
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,000
become predictive

281
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,760
so this slide is a little bit hard to

282
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,560
explain in a few minutes but each peak

283
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,040
path corresponds to a different customer

284
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,720
a different network

285
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,880
on the x-axis you see the time on the

286
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,160
y-axis you see some regions in the world

287
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,399
and when it is read it means that women

288
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,200
have to save a lot of traffic

289
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,079
from having sla violations thanks to the

290
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,160
prediction of the engine so in this case

291
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,640
it's not just about predicting an issue

292
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
it's also about finding an alternate

293
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,399
path with no issue

294
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,360
and we did many of our forecasting uh

295
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,440
things on top of us

296
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,279
the reason why i'm showing that to you

297
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,000
is these networks are very different for

298
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,920
some of them you see that

299
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,279
it goes from

300
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,160
being really good all over the path then

301
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,640
all that you see some other regions

302
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,880
where it's more reddish if you will it's

303
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,640
just in the given region

304
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,760
but then over time it goes from

305
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,440
having a lot of issues that we can

306
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
create and for which we can find an

307
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,279
internal path to some region where you

308
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,600
can't predict but you can you or you can

309
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,680
predict but there's no internal path

310
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,440
and you know why this is so interesting

311
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,680
it's interesting because you see the

312
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,560
need for constant learning constant

313
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,440
adjustment of a learning algorithm and

314
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,880
there's a reason for that we all know

315
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
about it it depends on the peering it

316
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,959
depends on the high dynamicity of the

317
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,120
internet

318
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,519
so with that i'm going to my conclusion

319
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,480
slide

320
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,320
and i'm sure that how we have many

321
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,480
opportunities to talk to some of you to

322
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,800
present more advanced results because

323
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,720
again it's more than a concept it's

324
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,040
really something we've been testing

325
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,720
for which we have a massive amount of

326
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,680
data and we'll be able to announce

327
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,360
very interesting innovations in the

328
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,560
coming months

329
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,720
but i believe that we need to enable the

330
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,079
internet

331
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,920
with the ability to learn

332
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,480
and learn means look at the past and

333
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,760
encode this behavior in a model

334
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,240
then use the model to do some prediction

335
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,320
and that i think that's absolutely key

336
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,639
the second aspect as i said before is

337
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,959
that instead of only looking at the

338
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,079
layer 3 and wanting adjacency or the you

339
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,720
know the path being alive with some fast

340
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,480
keeper like mechanism

341
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,399
we need to start

342
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,240
really to deeply understand the user

343
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,279
experience

344
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
and for me finding an entire path is not

345
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,200
about

346
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,440
reacting or predicting when the layer 3

347
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,519
is down it's also being able to

348
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,200
understand that the sla has been

349
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
violated the user experience is not good

350
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,720
enough across the layers so

351
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
as mercedes i love you love you know

352
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,360
this kind of prediction this kind of the

353
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,279
layering sorry

354
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,680
i also believe that we twisted a little

355
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,000
bit the concept of layering when we

356
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,240
looked at the iot for example

357
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,160
and the layering has been extremely

358
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,560
powerful it did allow the internet to

359
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,600
scale

360
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,320
but sometimes having the ability to have

361
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,360
cross layer signaling so that

362
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,399
we do understand the effect of the

363
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,320
characters of a part that will make the

364
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,240
artificial experience good or bad is

365
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,639
extremely important and i believe that

366
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,880
it's part of the predicting internet to

367
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,200
be able to predict but also to find the

368
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,000
best path not according to their three

369
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,440
metrics the

370
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,639
layer three to layer seven metrics

371
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,480
so with that um

372
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,240
i'm very happy to share a bit more

373
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,959
results i did publish some white papers

374
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,120
that you can find there are many white

375
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,360
papers will publish as we speak

376
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
and of course we have the opportunity to

377
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,680
to talk again in a few months with

378
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,519
concrete results

379
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,279
and i believe that the creative internet

380
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,760
will be a true part in shift in the

381
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,800
future thank you

382
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,670
thank you so much

383
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,639
[Music]

384
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,920
do we have any questions for him

385
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,760
well perhaps someone makes it to the

386
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,920
microphone i was wondering do you have

387
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,720
any predictions on uh when something

388
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,639
like this will become more commonplace

389
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,880
yeah it's a good it's a good question i

390
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,959
believe you know it's not a question of

391
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,040
years for sure

392
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,920
um we've been uh running this engine for

393
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,320
about one year now and that is kind of

394
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,120
the

395
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,600
dozens and almost you know i would say

396
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,440
hundreds of networks so we're probably

397
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,040
talking about six months i would say

398
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,800
of course you know it's a long journey

399
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,560
right as i said

400
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,199
uh we've been looking at this engine for

401
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,120
quite some time i believe that the

402
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,279
television internet is really about

403
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,519
understanding the basic from an

404
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,079
application standpoint get some layer 7

405
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,720
feedback then be able to do to make some

406
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,720
connection and then close the loop the

407
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,760
closure control which i believe is one

408
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,160
of the most interesting aspects of that

409
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,760
will take some time and that's why we

410
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,279
introduced solution of trusted

411
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,480
automation

412
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,000
because of course the users would want

413
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,160
to see the accuracy of the connection

414
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,040
before trusting the system but we you

415
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,560
know it's really around the corner i

416
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,880
believe this is going to be game changer

417
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,000
okay

418
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,760
and we have time for one more question

419
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,959
hi alan hannon from crowdstrike uh jp i

420
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,199
think it's about 27 years that cisco's

421
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,120
been presenting marketing as if it was

422
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,240
standards

423
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,440
i'm curious

424
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,040
i think of science as the ability to

425
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,360
predict and uh measure

426
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,880
when i looked at your information in

427
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,199
your slides all i saw were observations

428
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,880
do you have any data about your ability

429
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,199
to predict

430
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,600
yes yes we do so if you look at the

431
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,120
white pepper you know there's a white

432
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,839
paper when i'm sharing some data

433
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,920
uh as i said you know when i say that

434
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,680
we've been writing this engine for quite

435
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
some time you know alan what i'm saying

436
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,600
when i started this initiative i was

437
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,279
skeptical myself

438
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,959
because when you claim that you can

439
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,639
start predicting stuff

440
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,240
you really want to make sure that you

441
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,720
can really do it in a very reliable

442
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,360
fashion and with a high diversity of

443
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
network so we've been running that on

444
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,880
small networks

445
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,600
large networks in multiple areas and

446
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
what we see is that in for some network

447
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,440
you know we don't see

448
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,240
a

449
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,160
high degree of prediction simply because

450
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
there's nothing to predict on other

451
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,800
networks we can see that we can avoid

452
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,279
more than 50 percent of all issues that

453
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,320
we see

454
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,120
so it's all based on real data what i'm

455
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,680
trying to do is to issue to write a

456
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,320
white paper within three months probably

457
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,399
with accurate numbers

458
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,920
i just need to get the permission from

459
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,000
these customers as you can imagine

460
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,720
but yes we do have a lot of real

461
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,160
predictions that turned out to be

462
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,639
correct so it's not about you know

463
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,040
replacing the reactive mode will never

464
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,199
replace reactive mode

465
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,959
i wouldn't say that all of the

466
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,800
connections are correct and sometimes

467
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,959
there are some mistakes which we learn

468
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,120
from our own mistakes and

469
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,360
um i think that now we reach a maturity

470
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,000
that is high enough to make it a product

471
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
so i'm very happy to share again in a

472
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,359
few months

473
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,959
a bunch of results based on these

474
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,160
networks

475
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,760
what about false negatives or false

476
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,359
predictions does that cause damage

477
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,559
well

478
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,039
it could you know so do we have some

479
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,400
force negative

480
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
uh yes we do

481
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,720
and that's why i do i do rely on

482
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,919
reactive mechanism to handle it because

483
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,839
but you know when you play with machine

484
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,600
learning as you know you're using

485
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,440
machine learning as you say you have a

486
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,559
tension between pro and precision so we

487
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,120
tune the algorithm to have a

488
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
high precision meaning very very small

489
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,880
number of past positive

490
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,360
they are a few false positive it is at

491
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,679
the price of a low recall meaning that

492
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,960
sometimes you can have some first

493
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,520
negative but at the end of the day you

494
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,919
know what we do we show the overall

495
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,799
benefit what i mean by that is

496
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,240
when indeed

497
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
there is a false positive and you rerun

498
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
for nothing that's okay but you may be

499
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,559
right on a path that is worse than the

500
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,640
original path in this case we deduct

501
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,320
that we take it as

502
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,400
a negative impact when you suffer the

503
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,960
negative impact and the positive impact

504
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,440
yeah the very very large

505
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,080
benefits overall

506
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,200
