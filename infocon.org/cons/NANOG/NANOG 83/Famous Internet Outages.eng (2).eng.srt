these gentlemen

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,559
but for the benefit of those who may not

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,760
or for those

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,280
at home intending for the first time

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,320
i'll just go

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,280
um from my end um to the opposite end to

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,240
my right to your left is doug midori

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,119
um

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,479
doug works for kentick he's um if you

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,159
have the opportunity you'll see if you

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,159
could go ahead and put it up

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,159
if you look at the slide deck we had

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,080
look at the his twitter address he has a

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,000
really interesting twitter feed that you

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
should follow lots of good stuff about

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,240
internet events and whatnot he's really

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,040
kind of

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,720
our eye in the sky so to speak and what

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,320
on the internet outages and anomalies

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,520
um to his rights in the in the middle on

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,960
the other opposite side is avi friedman

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
it just so happens avi works at the same

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,119
organization in fact you all know avi

45
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,399
he's hosting

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,600
uh this

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,000
event this time he was the ceo for

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,560
kentick um but he had he's

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,280
well that was his main role um perhaps

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,960
he thought he's actually here for a

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,799
different reason this nana you'll find

52
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,479
out briefly in a moment

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,320
to his right is

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,240
jared mock who many of you will

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,240
certainly know if not from where he's

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,600
worked or where he works currently which

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,960
is akamai

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,919
previously at ntt briefs didn't nustar

59
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,560
he runs the the very well-known puck

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,560
nether service so you've probably joined

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,239
a few of his mailing lists

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,400
i've seen mail traffic from his systems

63
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,680
pass through he participates in a lot of

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,760
itf stuff these days as well

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,680
so i'm i'll

66
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
skip now right to the questions i want

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,360
to kind of go chronologically some one

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,599
of the earliest events

69
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,920
perhaps the most famous of all the

70
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,680
internet outages

71
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,959
that all of us may have heard of or

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,480
heard

73
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,720
or even seen the wikipedia page of is

74
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,120
this thing known as

75
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,640
as7007 event

76
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
and i'm going to let abby talk about

77
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,800
this navi i want to ask you if you would

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,560
just take a couple of minutes to tell

79
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,239
those who for the two people who've sort

80
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,920
of wandered into the room who who don't

81
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,480
belong here what that event was what led

82
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,159
up to it what was sort of

83
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,360
occurred

84
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,200
in the outcome of it but why you in

85
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,120
particular of a particular person of

86
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,879
interest that we want you here to talk

87
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,560
about that about what was your what was

88
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,120
your personal involvement

89
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,319
wow are there any leos in the audience

90
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,080
okay so pretend this is the hallway

91
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,800
track isn't it okay

92
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
so you know we're talking about internet

93
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,360
outages

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,239
and

95
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,319
the internet in some ways is like the

96
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,680
human body

97
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,000
the more you understand of it the more

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,840
amazed you are not that it breaks but

99
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,080
that it ever worked in the first place

100
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,319
and

101
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,760
some of the things that caused the

102
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,519
internet to break

103
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,200
are actually

104
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,760
technological implementations to get

105
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,360
around stupid human

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
rules and policies

107
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,799
so um

108
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,319
you know settlement and peering and

109
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,159
things like that and that factors into

110
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,120
this as7007 story

111
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,959
so

112
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,200
back in the 90s

113
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,319
a number of networks had a policy that

114
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,840
said

115
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,159
if you are my customer

116
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,280
i won't

117
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,799
appear with you if you buy transit from

118
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,159
me you have no hope of getting transit

119
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,280
from me

120
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,400
and that

121
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,480
drove people to not want to buy from

122
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,079
people they wanted to get

123
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,320
to get appearing from

124
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,918
and then some networks said okay if

125
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,918
you've ever been a customer we will

126
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,880
never

127
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,600
we will never uh you know peer with you

128
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,880
and so

129
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,440
a friend of mine vinnie bono and i were

130
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,199
sitting around in

131
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,040
the dc area saying aha

132
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,520
what if we get an as

133
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,000
to be a customer of this network that we

134
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,840
would like to peer with and then we will

135
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,840
be a customer of it because they only

136
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,360
went one level of indirection because if

137
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
you go many levels of indirection you

138
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,560
sort of get the whole internet so that

139
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,919
doesn't work

140
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:50,800
so

141
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,720
we decided to call it

142
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,400
not the florida internet exchange the

143
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,160
fat man little man internet exchange

144
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,600
because vinnie is shorter than i am and

145
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,520
i was even more engineer sized at the

146
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,479
time

147
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,160
so um

148
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,639
we registered as7007

149
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,639
vinnie bought a router

150
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,240
which sounds like a children's book um

151
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,280
see vinnie by her router and so avi said

152
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,320
please

153
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,639
please buy a cisco you know

154
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,800
i may or may not say that now but he

155
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
wanted to buy

156
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,919
a router that he thought was very

157
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,479
advanced in its capabilities it was one

158
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,800
of the first that had some distribution

159
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,080
inside of it

160
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,479
down to the line cards and it was a

161
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,240
wellfleet router

162
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,360
now each line card on this router

163
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,919
could run protocols and peer with each

164
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,600
other like isn't that really cool like

165
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,360
now we have kubernetes clusters to do

166
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,960
this but you know at the time it was one

167
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,080
of the first

168
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,759
now i wasn't a fan because it was sort

169
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,440
of like writing a logo program to help

170
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,199
someone support it because it was a gui

171
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,960
and i wanted a cli but anyway so he

172
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,800
bought it and then i didn't really think

173
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,199
much of it we set it up we got we got

174
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,000
transit we both got transit from it and

175
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560
then it was just a path on my network at

176
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,199
net access didn't think much of it until

177
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,960
about a year later when one of my

178
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,360
customers called me in a panic and said

179
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,319
avi i'm sending you a slash 17.

180
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,880
why are you re-advertising it to me as a

181
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,520
24 and who the is excuse me who the

182
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,240
hell is 7007.

183
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,039
and i was like oh

184
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,520
so i called vinnie who did not answer at

185
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
the time and i went on the internet

186
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
there was no dog at the time so you know

187
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,000
we had we had inet access mailing list

188
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,919
we had nanagan trying to figure out

189
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,280
what's going on looking at the routing

190
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
table looking at the instability

191
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,880
um and

192
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,000
it turns out from talking to vinnie

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,080
which is he actually posted to nanag i

194
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,360
think

195
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,720
that he had

196
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,120
you know i was basically advising don't

197
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,800
continue to debug it just like turn your

198
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,560
router off

199
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,080
except i missed something very important

200
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,240
what actually happened i apologize

201
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
so what happened was

202
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,039
bgp on one blade

203
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,080
talking to uh sprint 1239

204
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,199
bgp

205
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,280
on another blade talking to his network

206
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,919
which i think at the time was mai

207
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,400
ripped v1 in between

208
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,199
now rip v1 is missing the ability to

209
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,560
carry some very important things

210
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,720
and you might think a s path is the most

211
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,199
important thing but actually

212
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,800
classful

213
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,199
at versus classless

214
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,039
is is the most important thing and rip

215
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,840
v1 a slash 17 just becomes what's the

216
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,240
first octet is it abc

217
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,199
um and so things got that that was the

218
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,120
cause of the de-aggregation

219
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,240
but also

220
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,199
everything got re-advertised as 7007

221
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,479
which was

222
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,120
uh on the the as running on the blade

223
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
the talk to sprint

224
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,879
so anyway this happened

225
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,919
trying to debug it basically eventually

226
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,759
that router got shut down

227
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,919
but as sometimes happened at the time

228
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,280
back when

229
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,240
the average router had the cpu of a

230
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,400
five-year-old macintosh

231
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,240
and memory

232
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,440
was the upstream had difficulty purging

233
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,680
all the bad information so i think it

234
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,000
was about

235
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,919
six or eight hours later that everything

236
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,879
finally you know returned to normal and

237
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,199
um various people were apologizing to

238
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,080
various folks and rip v1 got turned off

239
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,520
on the router and

240
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,120
that's that was sort of the story but

241
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,280
when one of your customers calls you and

242
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,039
tells you that you're advertising their

243
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,799
their routes back in a way that you

244
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,200
shouldn't be able to it's definitely uh

245
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,080
was not a fun moment so um

246
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,760
in hindsight it's fun and we laugh about

247
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,919
it but it's time it was well we waited

248
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,040
almost 25 years for you to tell us yeah

249
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,320
and we appreciate it you did treat it

250
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,519
just like a hallway truck with the

251
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,839
explicatives yes yeah that's actually

252
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,240
what happened i was like holy yes holy

253
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,000
wow so let me ask you a follow-up

254
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,320
question before we move on

255
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,800
in in hindsight now this is this is now

256
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,839
occurred i don't think we're going to

257
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,120
find many people trying to do anything

258
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,480
quite similar especially the rip version

259
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,920
one anymore

260
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,880
but

261
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,839
what

262
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,360
what

263
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,440
was the result of that outage did

264
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,600
anything significant change not just for

265
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,440
you obviously in the network perhaps

266
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,360
that you had built or supported other

267
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,279
things that vinnie had decided on how to

268
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,399
set this up but the industry effect what

269
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,000
what actually came about because of this

270
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,279
has anything really changed could this

271
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,160
happen again i mean we suck and we're

272
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,320
mostly lazy dumbasses until manor is

273
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,839
happening recently

274
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,000
we've got massive problems with source

275
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,760
address filtering that haven't really

276
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,600
been universally addressed

277
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,279
yet you know it's something that we

278
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,240
really should have been dealing with

279
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,120
sooner

280
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,200
um you know it's great what's going on

281
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,760
with manners path validation is up next

282
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,160
um which is still a complex problem

283
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,760
so other than as7007 being in some aspas

284
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,800
access lists for a very long time

285
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,440
in theory to this day as patrick

286
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,360
but other than you know please don't buy

287
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,760
it and use as7007

288
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,720
i mean

289
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,560
you know there's probably there's still

290
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,079
i don't know the exact count cata

291
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,920
probably knows maybe doug knows any and

292
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,399
i haven't asked him how many aas's could

293
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,399
do this and are really unfiltered maybe

294
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,640
even not with max prefix

295
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,120
it's more than one and less than 10 and

296
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
i really couldn't tell you so i wish

297
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
there was more of an impact i don't know

298
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,880
if anyone else i mean

299
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,079
we could see if anyone else thinks there

300
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,680
was an impact from it maybe i'm wrong

301
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,920
well we'll have some time at the at the

302
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,880
end too if

303
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,040
other people want to contribute i mean i

304
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,360
know a lot of service providers don't uh

305
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,240
you know

306
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,440
don't filter

307
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,240
uh

308
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,920
quite as well or quite as much as they

309
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,440
should oh you're a good guy i trust you

310
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,279
you are yeah you want screwups it's fine

311
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,519
yeah yeah and and and that's what that's

312
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,760
largely the way it you know i think it

313
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,079
is in many cases for the providers today

314
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,279
is that

315
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,360
especially with everybody going these

316
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,079
days for a cloud on-ramp type solution

317
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,839
uh you know so many people are going and

318
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,880
connecting you know to to those places i

319
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,640
see there to be a lot of potential risk

320
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
for those routes to get advertised out

321
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,320
ddos mitigation yeah i need to be able

322
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,880
to advertise anyone yeah yeah yeah

323
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,560
yeah yeah there's

324
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,519
there's definitely a lot of

325
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,120
opportunities for

326
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,000
uh

327
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,640
for inadvertent mistakes and uh you know

328
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,560
being being the types of engineers we

329
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,880
are in uh and being human uh

330
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,800
bad things happen all the time people

331
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,000
forget you know emit config pieces and

332
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,320
uh you know filter filters are missing

333
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,000
and there's always there's always

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,399
something router configs that look a lot

335
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,839
the same but are

336
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,680
subtly different between different

337
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,480
operating systems yes

338
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,360
let me let me ask you now jared

339
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,519
slightly more recently but still quite

340
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,440
some time ago

341
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,920
almost 20 years ago now

342
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,240
there's this worm called slammer

343
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,920
sapphire

344
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,680
and for any of you who were around in

345
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,440
those days that you probably remember

346
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,200
this evening probably pretty distinctly

347
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,519
if you were awake or on call

348
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,040
tell us if you would just briefly

349
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,200
why was this a significant event and

350
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,440
perhaps what led to

351
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,639
i know in my own cases some outages uh

352
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,320
of this and why

353
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,240
what was your specific involvement in

354
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,240
this because again here here was someone

355
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,839
who i think had played a particularly

356
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,040
important role

357
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,399
not in causing it but in helping

358
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,399
actually mitigate it so please

359
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,680
if you would yeah yeah yeah so the uh

360
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,000
you know i i call it the the slammer

361
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,399
event or the micros it was uh

362
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,920
there's the software bug in the

363
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,000
microsoft sql server

364
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,839
uh that happened to actually be

365
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,920
installed on many many people's

366
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,320
computers uh because i i believe it was

367
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,399
in some sdk that basically ended up on a

368
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,160
lot of different you know in a lot of

369
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,760
different applications and so a lot of

370
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,040
people didn't realize they were actually

371
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,600
running a sql server on their laptop or

372
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,480
their

373
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,600
you know their machine if they had a

374
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
certain application set

375
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,320
so

376
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,120
what happened was somebody had figured

377
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,639
out that there was this

378
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,880
uh specific packet that you could send

379
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,800
that was self-replicating

380
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,440
uh and they basically built in a scanner

381
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,760
inside of this

382
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,000
udp packet that you could send on port

383
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,920
1434

384
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,760
and you could basically send it out to

385
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,839
the whole internet and what happened was

386
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,560
as each progressive machine got infected

387
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,040
it started to send pretty close to line

388
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,720
rate udp

389
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,000
uh out

390
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,800
all

391
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,720
out to most of the address space there

392
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,240
was actually some bugs in it so it

393
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,079
wouldn't actually uh

394
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,480
go and scan the full internet address

395
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,360
space

396
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,320
um

397
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
which people later figured out how to

398
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,240
improve on and fix once they were

399
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,199
reverse engineered fixed bugs yes yes

400
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,720
must fix this must fix this math bug um

401
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,120
in the in the scanner but

402
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,760
you know imagine you know that this was

403
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,000
uh what this was 2002 or 2003 times

404
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,680
um is is is what i recall and so

405
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,519
the you know the high-speed internet

406
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,160
connections that a lot of us have today

407
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,240
um you know at our homes and such that

408
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,079
was this that was the size of the big

409
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,680
data center connections servers were

410
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,560
connected primarily at you know um 100

411
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,000
meg and all of a sudden you have this

412
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,519
hundred meg line rate and a lot of

413
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,519
people had you know for their offices

414
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,240
they would have a t1 or maybe a ds3 or

415
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,360
something if you had a very big

416
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,040
connection and all of a sudden now

417
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,199
you've got a machine you know multiple

418
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,320
machines

419
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,600
scanning you

420
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,279
and sending and filling up your internet

421
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,360
connection inbound um you know if you

422
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,279
have a couple t1s at your office or in

423
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,639
your data center

424
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,880
which was pretty typical at the time uh

425
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,160
or if you were lucky enough to have a

426
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,399
ds3 or oc3 or something all of a sudden

427
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,320
now you have all of that capacity being

428
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,800
filled up not only inbound but outbound

429
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,519
on your network um so at the time i was

430
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,199
working at ntt

431
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,360
and we operate uh you know we had

432
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,279
operated a very large network at that

433
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,399
time uh and were a big aggregator for a

434
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,959
lot of these connections and you would

435
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,000
have

436
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,320
the proportional impact to that to the

437
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,399
downstream customer was based on how

438
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,480
much i p address space you had routed to

439
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,800
you and people would have like oh you

440
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,680
know a slash 16 or more routed out uh

441
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,160
you know these very small t1 links

442
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,320
t1 or ds3 links or something and those

443
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,519
would end up actually filling up

444
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,120
and

445
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,959
that created some very interesting

446
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,480
challenges in trying to mitigate it

447
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,519
because

448
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,199
as i've had some debates with other

449
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,759
other friends of mine over the years

450
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,720
you know

451
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,120
is your job to provide internet service

452
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,639
how much do you cling to things like the

453
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,560
end-to-end principle and how much do you

454
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,680
need to like

455
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,480
stop the bad thing from going on and as

456
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,079
a big service provider you definitely

457
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,240
don't want to be the internet's firewall

458
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,480
um you know you want to be able to allow

459
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,560
applications to pass through but what we

460
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,440
ended up doing is i i can't remember who

461
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,600
was on call at the time but we ended up

462
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,519
implementing brand new filtering across

463
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,279
the entire backbone where we actually

464
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,720
dropped

465
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,920
not rate limiting not rate limiting uh

466
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,440
we did rate limiting for some future

467
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,079
events uh but we ended up do just

468
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,560
putting in hard filters on the routers

469
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
based on the interface type so we had

470
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,320
these interface description codes that's

471
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,800
like bb if it's a backbone to backbone

472
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,639
link or bc if it was backbone to

473
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,920
customer

474
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,240
and bp if it was backboned up here and

475
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,320
what we ended up starting off doing is

476
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,240
uh putting filters on all the customer

477
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,000
facing interfaces

478
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,120
um and

479
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,959
and started to use the apply groups and

480
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,120
we did and i'm sure this still lives on

481
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,000
today and the configs at that provider

482
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,320
is we actually did this matching based

483
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,720
on the the type code and implemented a

484
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,959
way to basically roll out filters across

485
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,199
all the customer interfaces to go and

486
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,920
block the traffic uh you know at least

487
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,600
on all the junipers

488
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,040
which we did quickly and then we were

489
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,360
able to roll that out to the cisco's uh

490
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
you know uh later but we actually went

491
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,759
and we put filters in place to drop alt

492
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,079
all udp to 1434

493
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:58,959
uh

494
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,160
to basically block the spread of this uh

495
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,319
you know and to limit the damage to the

496
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,959
customers uh that were experiencing that

497
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,400
at that time and then i think there was

498
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,240
an analog not long after where i

499
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,880
remember talking about this as well

500
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,160
um

501
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,439
one of one of the things i wanted to

502
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,000
also see if you would address too is

503
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,640
along with what you did at ntt

504
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,079
yeah one of the

505
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,000
the key pieces of of how all this sort

506
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,079
of went down or got mitigated is that

507
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,760
you didn't do this necessarily alone in

508
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,640
a vacuum because folks like chris morrow

509
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,400
and barry green and others there was a

510
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,480
community of people who sort of

511
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,320
came together to you know communicate

512
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,840
and deal with this so say something

513
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,440
about the the community of people that

514
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,160
and

515
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,520
how did you actually do this especially

516
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,360
if there was links down he could maybe

517
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,559
necessarily even communicate in some

518
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,960
cases yeah yeah so so at the time there

519
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,520
was there is a there's been a variety of

520
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,160
different communication things so uh

521
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,320
there was the nsp security forum which

522
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,200
was one

523
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,600
a mailing list that a lot of people um

524
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,679
joined that were you know that were able

525
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,679
to go and mitigate and work on some of

526
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,360
the security issues that were going on

527
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
between all the different networks is a

528
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,200
nice place to share that there's also

529
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,600
something from uh

530
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,760
dial the ass yeah i was going to mention

531
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,280
so there was there was something that uh

532
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,200
packet clearinghouse ran which was

533
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,600
something called i knocked dba which was

534
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,360
dialed by asn

535
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
um so you could actually you had these

536
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,400
uh sip phones uh that were sit on your

537
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,640
desk and you could actually dial like

538
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,240
two nine 2914

539
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,320
and you know and then somebody's

540
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,919
initials or something like that at the

541
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,400
company and you can actually call like

542
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,320
by asn and call somebody and say oh i

543
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,120
need to get to somebody at you know uh

544
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,200
at ntt and you could actually dial two

545
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,480
nine one four

546
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,120
uh and actually end up there uh later

547
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,400
when i ended up actually running the

548
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,120
phone system i actually tied it into ein

549
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,360
dba as well so you could if you were a

550
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,360
customer you and you had inoc dba you

551
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,840
could actually do that and get into the

552
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,559
knock um directly uh you know just

553
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,240
direct you know a direct call over the

554
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,760
internet in case the phone system was

555
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,640
down

556
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,160
um

557
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,600
yeah yeah

558
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,960
you know patrick's here in the front row

559
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,720
saying assuming the internet is up but i

560
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,799
think what's interesting today is the

561
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,360
internet is more largely up than than

562
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,600
some of these phone networks um when you

563
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,280
start talking about the types of outages

564
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,480
we see

565
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,400
you know that we've seen in more recent

566
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,440
history uh so it's it's it's definitely

567
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,960
interesting to me how the tables have

568
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,440
turned on that over time but but inoc

569
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,520
dba was a great way to

570
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,919
collaborate with people other carriers

571
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,000
just by show of hands in the audience i

572
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,039
know this exists some places who has udp

573
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,919
port 1434 filters still on the network

574
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,200
anybody

575
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,360
i know some of you do because i can

576
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,799
i've seen it

577
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,320
there are two people that some of those

578
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
filters still exist i know

579
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,799
i i'm sure i remember it took us a

580
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,240
couple years to get them off all the

581
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,080
customer interfaces

582
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,919
and then you would still find machine i

583
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,039
i believe there's probably still

584
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,320
machines today spraying 1434 that are

585
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,559
probably still infected that that would

586
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,400
absolutely not surprise me because these

587
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,080
things seem to never die

588
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,320
now last but not least doug

589
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,600
we'll aim this last one for you and then

590
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,679
we're going to go to q a

591
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,919
so yours is much more recent one of the

592
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,840
things that and you you're particularly

593
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,120
good at this

594
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,520
in your twitter feed even is that we

595
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,880
hear about

596
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,200
very regularly it seems these days about

597
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,000
internet shutdowns

598
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,720
gun countries or governments actually

599
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,600
doing something to disrupt or disable or

600
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,039
turn off the internet somehow in their

601
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,320
region

602
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,159
what what is this what's going on are

603
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,679
routers literally being shut down or

604
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,760
links being terminated or bdp sessions

605
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,559
dropping what's actually going on here

606
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,080
yeah a variety of things is this a new

607
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,480
phenomenon yeah so i i got introduced to

608
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
this topic um

609
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,559
during the arab spring so the shutdown

610
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,480
in egypt in january 2011. and i'm not

611
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,240
going to go through that story i think

612
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
people generally know uh what took place

613
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,159
there

614
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,799
and so i was fairly new to renesas at

615
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,440
the time and and so i was helping you

616
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
know just trying to figure out

617
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,880
you know what what exactly took place we

618
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,120
saw all the b2b routes go down

619
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,159
um that event i've since argued has kind

620
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,000
of ushered us into our modern era of

621
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,640
government suppressed communications and

622
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,159
internet shutdowns

623
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,840
that we're living in today and there's a

624
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,240
lot of legacy i think from that

625
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,480
from that event so we had there were

626
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,320
other shutdowns in the arab spring with

627
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,159
libya bahrain uh syria and then over the

628
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,760
years it migrated to

629
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,600
africa where there was a lot of just a

630
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,360
lot of contested elections in the

631
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,200
following years and now it's kind of

632
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
just everywhere and

633
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,919
um yeah some of the

634
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,480
legacies are uh you know there's

635
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,440
now a lot of the there's a big area in

636
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,360
the digital rights space of

637
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,159
organizations that either got got more

638
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,120
important or came to came into existence

639
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,840
like accessnow

640
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,559
netblocks

641
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,880
internet science frontiers as

642
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,200
these are there are people who work full

643
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,559
time now

644
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,559
documenting and advocating against these

645
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,480
things this is a a profession of uh

646
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,280
working against these these

647
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
events and then on top of that there's

648
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,640
also a lot of

649
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,840
public tools that people have built

650
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,799
so out of cada came the iota project um

651
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,840
kwafler's got their radar uh project had

652
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,200
when i was with oracle we had an

653
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,880
internet weather map but also put it put

654
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,559
out some

655
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,320
internet connectivity stats so people

656
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,240
could you know see for themselves the

657
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,600
other countries all the routes for a

658
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,520
country were were suddenly pulled and i

659
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,240
could

660
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,120
hopefully

661
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,280
the the the hope was uh you know the

662
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,120
more light you were to shine on these

663
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,440
things um they might

664
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,400
uh

665
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,799
you know shame governments into not

666
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,000
doing it um and uh the results i think

667
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,120
are kind of

668
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,440
mixed i'm not sure it's it's still

669
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,240
unclear like so in this this year uh i

670
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,600
don't take it through the last decade

671
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,200
but just even just in this year so we

672
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,520
had a contested election in uganda where

673
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,039
the government was shut down the

674
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,280
internet for a week a military coup in

675
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,720
myanmar protests in cuba

676
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,760
where there was a

677
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
shutdown just in recent weeks bangladesh

678
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,280
was down for a day because of violence

679
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,640
against a

680
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,600
hindi minority and then uh i i haven't

681
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,640
been able to check i've been traveling

682
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,480
today i don't know if sudan is back up

683
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,159
but it's been there's a military coup

684
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,760
last week in sudan

685
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,559
military and the mobile internet has

686
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,640
been uh deactivated but you asked about

687
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,320
like methodology

688
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,760
and so in most of these places there

689
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,559
isn't like a centralized kill switch

690
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,480
where there's a technical means where

691
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,159
someone can push a button and turn turns

692
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,720
things off in fact like in myanmar

693
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,520
it was by fax they were faxing around

694
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,000
the orders this is the the military

695
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,320
junta of we um expect you to turn

696
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,440
you know there was different phases in

697
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,919
that one this is when the mobile uh

698
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,880
service was uh was turned off uh that

699
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,039
was uh i talked to somebody who was who

700
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,200
was um there was involved and they said

701
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,039
they got a fax and i basically had to

702
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,039
follow the order um

703
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,279
but um uh it takes pl so egypt was and

704
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,360
as was like a nuclear option everything

705
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,600
goes down fixed line mobile everything

706
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,080
um and then there's some

707
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,120
uh other other variations where like in

708
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,960
sudan it's mostly mobile uh mobile

709
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,480
service and that seems to be

710
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,159
one way to be a bit more precise in your

711
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,000
suppression of communications because

712
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,120
you may have the streets filled with

713
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,799
protesters and that's who you're trying

714
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,320
to target whereas people in offices and

715
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,600
they don't want to cut themselves off

716
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,720
they want to cut off businesses they

717
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,240
just want to turn off

718
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,799
service for the mass populous and in

719
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,360
most these places and maybe even

720
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,600
i mean in our our country too like we'll

721
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,919
mostly we access the internet through a

722
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,640
handset so if you turn off just disable

723
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,400
just

724
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,480
administratively disable

725
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,960
the service via mobile then you can

726
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
knock out most people's access to the

727
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,799
internet and

728
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,279
yeah it's a it's a it's like an ongoing

729
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,360
human rights issue

730
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,679
can you see or have you looked even at

731
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,559
the

732
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,559
any long-term or longer-term effects of

733
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,600
if there's

734
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,760
some so-called shutdown any does the

735
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,240
traffic patterns from before and after

736
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,080
change the thing this is there some

737
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,919
reaction to these shutdowns where

738
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,360
something about the

739
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,960
when it comes back up is it they look

740
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,400
different they're not going to be

741
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,840
different in some way

742
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,440
people are people looking to find ways

743
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,520
around it that sort of thing

744
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,559
um

745
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,000
i guess

746
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,480
let's see i i don't recall a time when

747
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,080
it came back up it was you know

748
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,159
materially different

749
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,480
it doesn't come to mind um you know we

750
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,400
also try to this is both from my

751
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,919
we learned a lesson in egypt that we

752
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,679
kind of put a spotlight on one provider

753
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,440
that was still up and then they

754
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,799
government found them and turned them

755
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,640
down so it turned them off so we kind of

756
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,919
thought about being a little bit

757
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,440
selective when we saw

758
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,360
uh you know remaining networks like

759
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,720
there was an outage in syria that you

760
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,080
can see the academic network was still

761
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,000
up and we kept that to ourselves we had

762
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,520
a contact in the u.s state department

763
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,279
during arab spring we passed that to

764
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,960
them we did not go public so we tried to

765
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,320
be a little bit more circumspect about

766
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,279
some of the

767
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,960
or

768
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,240
guarded about some of the information we

769
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,320
would see but um and then and some of

770
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,279
these

771
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,200
uh outages in africa

772
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,480
sometimes the government doesn't quite

773
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,320
know its own internet layout and so

774
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,000
they'll turn off fixed line but then a

775
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,200
lot of these countries are still very

776
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,640
reliant on satellite we'll see the

777
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,279
satellite pop up again we keep that to

778
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,440
ourselves uh we may you know talk to

779
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,200
some of these ngos let them know because

780
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,880
they're they're in the process of

781
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,039
advocating and they've got usually like

782
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,120
access now so we've got a good i've

783
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,559
always had a good relationship with them

784
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,039
uh if i've got something technical i can

785
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,320
i know they're going to do the right

786
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,880
thing with any information i provide

787
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,799
and then they are

788
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,640
they have people in many countries

789
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,880
trying to make sure people have some way

790
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,960
to securely connect out and

791
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,679
so some of these outages we've seen

792
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,400
links stay up and um we don't draw

793
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,480
attention to them um we may let somebody

794
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,400
know who uh could do something positive

795
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,159
with that information

796
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,000
when i've when i've looked at some of

797
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,840
this and i don't look as much as doug

798
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,039
does but

799
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,640
um

800
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,399
definitely seen some of the application

801
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,520
mix

802
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,840
change but it's a little fuzzier for us

803
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,880
because

804
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,480
to really see like

805
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,720
this is apple downloads versus apple

806
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,200
itunes versus or which facebook you know

807
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,279
it's whatsapp versus facebook we need

808
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,279
dns and we don't have a huge customer

809
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,799
base in these areas

810
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,840
um but definitely seen you know you can

811
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,080
tell even by ais you can tell

812
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,520
you know uh

813
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,279
different application mechs after but we

814
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:50,320
haven't really looked into there's

815
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,000
definitely also behavior people the

816
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,399
people of these countries world react uh

817
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,159
so like sciphon's a very popular uh

818
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,960
uh censorship circumvention tool uh

819
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
and so when there's an event like in in

820
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,520
cuba this summer the your typhon will

821
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
publish this big spike of all these

822
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,799
downloads that they got like we're got

823
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,960
out this is what you need to circumvent

824
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960
and so that's one way people react to

825
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,880
these things but if if they

826
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,840
i i made the argument in a wired uh

827
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,080
article this summer where uh again

828
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,440
trying to look at what's the what's the

829
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,720
trend over 10 years since since egypt

830
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,960
that um it may have been the case uh you

831
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,080
know all the advancement in

832
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,880
circumvention tools like sciphon

833
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,240
things like that

834
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,919
you know may

835
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:34,960
uh

836
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,360
like when we turn off egypt uh without

837
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
everything was offline that really

838
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,600
negatively impacts the economy the

839
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
government itself needs the interest

840
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,399
they need to be a little more it seemed

841
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,240
like that wasn't going to happen again

842
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,679
initially were that it was going to be

843
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:48,720
such a

844
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,799
impactful outage that they would be more

845
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,640
selective what they shut down or maybe

846
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,960
just block block certain social media

847
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,039
but people are pretty crafty these days

848
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,960
maybe they weren't uh 10 years ago but

849
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,640
it's it's very common for people to have

850
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,520
uh vpns on their phones if if nothing

851
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,799
else just to be able to watch a soccer

852
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,840
game that they can't that they're

853
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,600
geofenced from so people have this

854
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,919
technology it's pretty pretty common now

855
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,279
and then

856
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,120
uh and so

857
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,279
if you don't um

858
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,120
so that would enable them to get around

859
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,320
any kind of censorship the government's

860
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,480
doing the only way to get to be

861
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,919
completely sure that nobody's

862
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,520
communicating is to just go back and

863
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,000
turn it all off i think that's uh some

864
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,840
of this may be a product some of these

865
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,840
total shutdowns may be a product of the

866
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,320
success and the innovation around

867
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,200
censorship circumvention

868
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,120
well this is

869
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,720
i was going to say i remember one of the

870
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,240
uh

871
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,520
meigmar

872
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,600
burma outages was

873
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,640
uh

874
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,960
you know when i was at ntt we had a

875
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,960
you know customer connection into that

876
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,480
country i remember

877
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
during that it was

878
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,640
the circuit was just down so this is the

879
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,880
this is like the 2008 that's like the oh

880
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,039
yeah early pre-egypt the

881
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,399
yeah maybe that maybe the maybe the

882
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,720
first real yeah yeah one of the first

883
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,720
big ones it was just you took the igor

884
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,399
switch yeah somebody yeah somebody

885
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,159
literally just you could tell they

886
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,600
unplugged it because you went you looked

887
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,440
at the router interface and it was

888
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,520
it was just down loss of service and

889
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,480
like

890
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,520
you know

891
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,559
because

892
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,760
yeah as you've mentioned sometimes

893
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,600
there's people in there who need to

894
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,559
communicate for life saving you know uh

895
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,799
you know life-threatening

896
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,520
uh purposes uh and stuff and it's it's

897
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,840
important to to check so i remember

898
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,200
looking at one point trying to figure

899
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,279
out if there was

900
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,799
you know what what the nature of the

901
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,360
outage was and and definitely

902
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,960
you know the people have gotten a lot

903
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,120
more crafty in how they do this

904
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,840
um you know there was the the outage uh

905
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,600
what was i think was in turkey where

906
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,600
they when they took all the dns servers

907
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,840
and and did stuff and people ended up

908
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,720
spray painting ip addresses

909
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,399
sure like that

910
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,840
yeah yeah that's a picture

911
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,919
there was graffiti

912
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,600
saying like this is this is how to do it

913
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,559
dns graffiti um you know

914
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,880
you know that ended up being very famous

915
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,039
so on education uh people were getting

916
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,399
smarter about how to use the internet

917
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:11,679
by necessity

918
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,519
i've only seen that outside cloudflare's

919
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,279
office yeah

920
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,679
he did 1.18

921
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,760
so as you can see just four people on

922
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,080
stage can talk about war stories i think

923
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,640
at nauseum but what i'd like to do if we

924
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,080
could and hopefully there will be some

925
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,919
willing participants in the audience

926
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,039
we're just over halfway through our time

927
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:38,240
i really like

928
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,840
not for these three gentlemen to do all

929
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,799
the work

930
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,120
so i invite anyone to go up to the mic

931
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,720
you can ask them certainly questions

932
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,159
about these particular outages you know

933
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,559
i tried to cover a security related one

934
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,880
one of the kind of the old time the bgp

935
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,960
one and then some more recent types of

936
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,880
outages with doug

937
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,279
um but come up to the mic and ask him

938
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,960
about any of those particular events but

939
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,000
what would um if you would like and also

940
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,840
opportunity for you

941
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,919
maybe take a couple of minutes to share

942
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,600
with us your

943
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,159

invite you to do that i know all of you

945
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,240
probably have at least oh i don't know

946
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,039
10 or 20 seconds if you caused it yeah

947
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,559
extra credit well anonymously well

948
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,720
if if i can i'd like to tell one of my

949
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,120
favorite stories so make your way up to

950
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,399
the mic but you go ahead jared and tell

951
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,399
the story and if there's anyone online

952
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,760
hopefully michael or somebody will read

953
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,600
that to us at the mic as well

954
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,080
so so one of my favorite stories to tell

955
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,760
was the time that i was on call and the

956
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,720
router was stolen

957
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,840
which which was definitely an

958
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,159
experience um so so what had happened

959
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,039
was

960
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,440
uh you know i i suddenly you know i was

961
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,320
on call and i got paged about this

962
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,039
router being offline and so you know uh

963
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,799
it was in some data center in some

964
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,880
location and you know so i end up

965
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,480
talking with the knock i try and get in

966
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,880
on the out-of-band console and it's not

967
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,159
responding

968
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,880
uh and so what what i ended up

969
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,360
uh doing was i ended up you know doing

970
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,200
what you do you dispatch a field tech

971
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,960
out to go look at

972
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,480
you know the router and go figure out

973
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
what's going on with it

974
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,559
well when the field tech shows up and we

975
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,640
get him on the phone he's basically like

976
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,880
uh you know hey

977
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,600
i'm here i'm looking at it but uh the

978
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,360
chassis is here but none of the line

979
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,440
cards are there

980
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,480
so so somebody had um gotten into the

981
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,679
data center

982
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,279
and uh

983
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,600
you know in in wherever this cola was

984
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,159
which uh you know the this was in the

985
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,840
days when i think you know cola would

986
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,559
you know wasn't as heavily secured as uh

987
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,720
you know as as we'd like to think in the

988
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,279
closet yeah yeah yeah

989
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,240
not quite broom closet but um

990
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,120
you know

991
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,440
they showed up and the the router was

992
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,120
you know all the parts were missing

993
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,640
except for the chassis

994
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,440
uh

995
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,399
and what it turns out actually happened

996
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,320
was earlier in the day the alarm had

997
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,399
actually gone off at the data center

998
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,480
uh and nothing had happened uh and then

999
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,399
about 12 hours later the alarm went off

1000
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:11,520
again

1001
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,440
uh and this time something had happened

1002
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,800
and so the first time you know the guy

1003
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,879
drove out checked on everything was like

1004
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,040
everything's fine and

1005
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,520
and came back and then it turns out yeah

1006
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,839
now uh the second time something was

1007
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,800
wrong uh and then we had to actually go

1008
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,199
and uh scramble and get all the spare

1009
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,040
parts from all of our spare depots and

1010
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,679
work on replenishing uh you know all the

1011
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,639
missing parts from the router so

1012
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,679
which is

1013
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,760
it it's very important when you're doing

1014
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
that type of thing to have backup copies

1015
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,599
of all of your configs and everything so

1016
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,199
we were able to you know

1017
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,719
have the configs pull those out of

1018
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,199
rancid get those onto the routers

1019
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,679
um but also we didn't have enough of the

1020
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,520
right parts between the two different

1021
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,679
vendors so i had to go and migrate some

1022
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,440
people from this what was the cisco

1023
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,000
routers or to the juniper router

1024
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,359
at the time and make sure we had all the

1025
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,760
right parts as well and uh this was like

1026
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
i think channelized ds3 days and so you

1027
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,760
had you know the different the little

1028
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,920
micro bnc connectors versus the bigger

1029
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,680
bnc connectors and

1030
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,119
thankfully we were able to get it all

1031
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,359
going but even some of the parts that we

1032
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,960
got from the spare depot were also

1033
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,920
failed uh you know or were bad and so

1034
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,160
then we had to go and order again and it

1035
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,160
made for a very long day you know to

1036
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,839
eventually go and get the customers back

1037
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,440
online

1038
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,160
uh but that that's one of my uh my my

1039
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,119
favorite little stories to tell because

1040
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,280
how often are you on call and all the

1041
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,280
pieces of the router go there's no snmp

1042
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,400
trap for

1043
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,240
router missing

1044
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,479
yeah

1045
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,599
patrick uh patrick gilmore d-pitched

1046
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,680
realty uh

1047
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,079
question about

1048
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,760
as7007 there's a rumor that has been

1049
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,000
persistent for a couple decades

1050
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,320
that the biggest problem was after

1051
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,400
vinnie literally unplugged the router so

1052
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,480
there's no electricity so clearly no

1053
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,680
announcements

1054
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,480
um

1055
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,280
the upstream sprint was still running

1056
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,240
ags pluses at the time which were old

1057
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,440
even then

1058
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
and there was a special

1059
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,680
which was not uncommon at the time for

1060
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,760
big vendor uh sorry big providers to get

1061
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,839
a special ios

1062
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,599
rev just for them so it was like dash

1063
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,040
door or something

1064
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,760
which did not accept withdrawals

1065
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,680
do you have any information on that

1066
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,079
i can either confirm or deny that

1067
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,640
because i really have no clue but that

1068
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,940
would be so cosmically

1069
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,160
[Laughter]

1070
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,359
to have

1071
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,119
to have an implementation that did not

1072
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,520
accept withdrawals that it's

1073
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,839
an implementation did not accept notify

1074
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,079
i've advocated for many times but an

1075
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,280
implementation does not accept

1076
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,400
withdrawals

1077
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,880
i i i have trouble

1078
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,680
even lothburgeonly um you know imagining

1079
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,400
that ticket being opened i've seen a lot

1080
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,440
of vendor bugs over the years and

1081
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,520
you know when in doubt it's probably a

1082
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,599
bug as opposed to something explicitly

1083
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,160
implemented like that it could be i just

1084
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,839
don't know well especially on those

1085
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,440
devices you know you you made the

1086
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,920
reference to the max cpu but it was you

1087
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
know it was a five-year-old mac cpu at

1088
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,400
that time so it was the motorola like

1089
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,520
68030 yeah um you know

1090
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,680
if you were lucky yeah is is is what was

1091
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,760
in that device which you know four gig

1092
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,480
or

1093
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,280
a gif well one gig or whatever yeah yeah

1094
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,760
they didn't have a gig okay

1095
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,359
all right uh

1096
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:31,839
so uh jared on your

1097
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,480
slammer thing uh the biggest problem

1098
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,560
i saw and many people saw was that uh so

1099
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
many people had flow switching going and

1100
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,000
there were so many different sources and

1101
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
destinations at the time

1102
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,560
that it just broke every flow cache on

1103
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,359
every router everything the vxrs

1104
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,119
yeah the vxrs that was fun um so did you

1105
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,119
have that problem in ntt or would you

1106
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,800
know once you've you were just dealing

1107
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,240
with full lines you didn't do flow

1108
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,280
switching no no we didn't

1109
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,920
the customer enragement feature no no no

1110
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,800
thank

1111
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,960
thankfully we didn't have anything where

1112
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,640
uh you know where that was the case i

1113
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,040
mean that was still when like uh you

1114
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,320
know soup to mfsc2 i think was you know

1115
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,760
quite common uh as well before soup 720.

1116
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,320
um and so as long as you were you had

1117
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,440
your mls uh configured correctly you uh

1118
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,640
just for mls ip destination um then then

1119
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,000
you were fine because that's all that

1120
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,240
was going into the hardware um and being

1121
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,920
a you know in a service provider role

1122
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,200
that's that's what we had um

1123
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,800
so you got lucky

1124
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,400
uh and finally doug on yours um

1125
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,480
i notice and this is not terribly

1126
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,680
insightful but i noticed that the

1127
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,920
biggest problem with uh not problem the

1128
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,599
biggest thing that is in common with all

1129
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,599
these countries that shut things down is

1130
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:48,880
that they have

1131
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,520
very simplistic internet topologies i

1132
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,560
mean if you tried to shut down the

1133
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,000
internet quote unquote in the united

1134
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,640
states or the uk or japan or something

1135
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,240
you couldn't do it right there's no list

1136
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,280
of every line

1137
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,160
okay in that particular way never never

1138
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,079
without an emp you know

1139
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,240
yes never never accept a challenge okay

1140
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,599
but um

1141
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,359
what's the chances are when's the time

1142
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:15,119
frame i don't know how to phrase the

1143
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,400
question when

1144
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,560
places like egypt are going to reach a

1145
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,079
point where the government can't just go

1146
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,839
in and pull six lines and suddenly the

1147
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,320
entire country has no internet i mean i

1148
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,839
think

1149
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,880
so years ago jim cowie was our one of

1150
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,400
the founders at renesas had written a

1151
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,839
blog

1152
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,119
saying could it happen in your country

1153
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,280
this is after the arab spring the topic

1154
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,599
was still on people's minds and it just

1155
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,520
did a very back of the back of the

1156
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,839
envelope kind of analysis of bgp level

1157
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,359
analysis how many

1158
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,280
uh independent bgb paths are out of a

1159
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,599
country like how many border as's are

1160
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,800
there and um and so then the the idea

1161
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,960
was you know the fewer the simpler the

1162
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,720
topology the sim uh

1163
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,400
especially if you if there's just one as

1164
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,760
that provides service into the country

1165
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,200
then it seems like it'd be really easy

1166
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,640
to turn that one off

1167
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,440
um

1168
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,400
i mean if you have the and so the

1169
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,839
argument would be if it's more complex

1170
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,440
it's harder to do

1171
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,440
but if the government knows the major

1172
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,560
providers

1173
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,119
and can fax or

1174
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,440
whatever call uh and tell them to shut

1175
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,079
things down kidnap the family members

1176
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:18,960
it does

1177
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,440
it's hard to overcome that now one topic

1178
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
one one thing that's come up this year

1179
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,319
especially with cuba for some reason was

1180
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,359
you could we float in balloons and blast

1181
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,480
down internet service into a country or

1182
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,280
and there are some

1183
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,440
there's a lot of there's a lot of new

1184
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,040
mega constellations of satellite

1185
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,480
services that are going up that are

1186
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,440
going to recreate you know all this uh

1187
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,079
low earth orbit uh stuff that um uh

1188
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,520
you'll be able to pull a signal from

1189
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,800
anywhere on the surface of the earth out

1190
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,400
of the sky with a small piece of

1191
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,839
equipment and could that make a

1192
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,000
difference and now technically legally

1193
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,920
speaking every one of those companies

1194
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
just like any other telecom operator

1195
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,480
needs to be licensed to legally provide

1196
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,040
service in the country now somebody at

1197
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,000
one point elon musk this summer uh was

1198
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,119
you know people were calling we gotta

1199
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,720
get you know

1200
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,520
uh

1201
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,839
i'm sorry spacex has got a you know

1202
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,240
blast internet into whatever country was

1203
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,160
that was maybe it's cuba one other

1204
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,599
country was having a problem that day

1205
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,760
and um and he's like yeah we're going to

1206
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,119
get on it and then someone was like well

1207
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,720
what about the it was someone in the

1208
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,640
industry was like what about the legal

1209
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,560
things that well they can you know shake

1210
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,599
their fists at the sky and yell uh for

1211
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,040
you know for all i care was his response

1212
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,640
so maybe somebody like that joke there

1213
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,340
about self-driving networks

1214
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,160
[Laughter]

1215
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,520
uh so

1216
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,160
um so the short answer is a very very

1217
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,079
long time

1218
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,400
yeah unless people i mean i you requires

1219
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,079
equipment on the ground to make the you

1220
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,000
know to so that would have to get in to

1221
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
receive a connection into the uh to a

1222
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
satellite um i don't know that topology

1223
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,079
makes a difference um i mean in the

1224
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,680
united states if the u.s mississippi

1225
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,599
never happened i don't think but um

1226
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,400
you know uh the us government gave an

1227
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,599
order

1228
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,160
to of the major mobile operators in the

1229
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,880
u.s to turn off mobile internet service

1230
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,200
for the whole country um it doesn't

1231
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,400
matter what the topology is if they

1232
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,480
i mean there this would go to court it's

1233
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,760
hard to imagine that taking place in a

1234
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,960
country like this but the topology i

1235
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,680
guess my point is uh it wouldn't matter

1236
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,040
if they could use ambernet except they

1237
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,640
sold their ip addresses they could do

1238
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,800
which we could use uh ampernet except

1239
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,280
they sold their ip addresses cb cv i

1240
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,560
don't know

1241
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,720
oh okay

1242
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,839
uh yeah so about

1243
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,119
please do state your name in your

1244
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,680
organization oh my name is i think

1245
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,200
i'm with zeo

1246
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,400
about 33 years ago i started a new job

1247
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,839
at the university of california at

1248
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:46,880
berkeley

1249
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,640
i was a network programmer

1250
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,520
third day on the job on november 2nd

1251
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,240
1988

1252
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,839
all of our systems went down

1253
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,720
flatline rebooted them brought them back

1254
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,079
up

1255
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,839
they went back down again then it was

1256
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,079
the start of the morse worm

1257
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,319
which used

1258
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,760
uh

1259
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,760
a uh

1260
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,599
back door that eric maldman had put in

1261
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,960
stand mail

1262
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,680
and uh a buffer overflow

1263
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,480
in the finger d program and the

1264
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,440
ubiquitous r commands uh trusting each

1265
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,800
other to

1266
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,400
basically make mincemeat of all the

1267
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,599
vaxxes

1268
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,880
and the suns and the internet

1269
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:38,880
so that anniversary is tomorrow

1270
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,079
we should have done this

1271
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,000
it also had bugs that were fixed later

1272
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,200
yeah yes

1273
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,440
let me um before you go let me if you're

1274
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,960
not if you're not finished i want to ask

1275
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,720
you a question about that since there's

1276
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,319
probably relatively fewer number of us

1277
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,520
who were around in those days i

1278
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,160
certainly wasn't what was the

1279
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,839
what was your feeling your reaction in

1280
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,079
those days because this was presumably

1281
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,480
long before people were so relying on

1282
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,720
for commerce why not was it like oh this

1283
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,440
is just fun or interesting or was it or

1284
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,960
were you mad were you shouting

1285
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,319
explicatives and getting calls from

1286
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,400
people like we were getting calls from

1287
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,079
people um

1288
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,520
one of the one of the uh the guy that uh

1289
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,119
left the back door in send mill was

1290
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,480
actually in the building uh eric allman

1291
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,560
so

1292
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,720
there was there was kind of like

1293
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,319
yeah this is really important this is

1294
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:29,839
terrible but also

1295
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,240
he was a sort of a comrade we didn't

1296
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,400
want anything to become of him there was

1297
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,079
a lot of people that aimed for uh

1298
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,200
uh uh what was his name uh

1299
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,599
robert morris robert morris tappen

1300
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,440
morris or something like uh

1301
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,359
did you hear him from his dad um

1302
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:50,560
they called for his head he actually

1303
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,160
went to jail

1304
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,800
um he was like the first one

1305
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,280
uh at least internet wide

1306
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,240
um

1307
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,319
so it was basically we patched it back

1308
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:01,119
up

1309
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,599
and then went on our merry way it took a

1310
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,599
it took a couple of days till for the

1311
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,480
entire internet to recover

1312
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,640
the users of my mud were very upset that

1313
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,720
my big wood i'd say i asked that temple

1314
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,720
that you kept crashing

1315
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,560
so

1316
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,480
oh that was that a mud was a mmorpg back

1317
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:23,680
before multi-user dungeon game yes yes

1318
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,040
yeah thank you very much for sharing

1319
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,000
that

1320
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,280
the person right behind you i think was

1321
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,280
next

1322
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,119
hi chris woodfield twitter um

1323
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,920
i'm curious about knock-on effects when

1324
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,520
there are major outages um

1325
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,440
thinking specifically about the most

1326
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,280
recent large-scale

1327
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,359
outage of a provider

1328
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,480
the fact that large network goes down to

1329
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,680
the point where it's withdrawing as

1330
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,920
prefixes is interesting enough

1331
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,880
um

1332
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,720
that's very meta down

1333
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,839
but then

1334
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:58,640
you

1335
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,040
what happens to the providers that are

1336
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,800
trying to reach that for example you

1337
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,400
know the flood of

1338
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,440
the flood of udp 53 that your backbone

1339
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,119
router doesn't have a route for so i had

1340
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,119
to send floods of ic reachables back

1341
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,960
what's when we have when when you see

1342
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,040
those types of large-scale outages

1343
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,640
um

1344
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,720
what do other networks

1345
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,119
see other than i can't send packets that

1346
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,520
way anywhere

1347
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,800
and that might be a good question for

1348
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,240
doug

1349
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,480
yeah i was i was going to say i've often

1350
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,440
seen

1351
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,480
you know

1352
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,760
you end up seeing all of these

1353
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,520
interesting knock-on side effects from

1354
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,880
whatever it is

1355
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,000
um so you either see yeah this ip space

1356
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,480
is unreachable uh and stuff and but you

1357
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,839
can generally see it if you have your

1358
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:46,160
applications instrumented really well

1359
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,680
uh so you may be able to see it in your

1360
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,920
dns servers be like hey i'm sending a

1361
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,240
lot more retries or retransmits for

1362
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,160
these things or i'm giving getting a lot

1363
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,920
more serve fail answers or something

1364
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,240
like that i think for me that really

1365
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,760
speaks to

1366
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,839
how much

1367
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:03,760
before an outage you need to have the

1368
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,000
baseline data available such that you

1369
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,760
understand during an outage what is

1370
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,200
actually going on

1371
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,440
because when you're when your support

1372
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,760
lines you know when the phone phone

1373
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,640
starts to ring uh which it still does

1374
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,319
uh and you're trying to figure out what

1375
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,160
exactly is going on

1376
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,920
uh you really need to have that key

1377
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,200
telemetry to understand where your

1378
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,720
baseline was before part of your

1379
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,559
architecture yeah it has to be built in

1380
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,559
as part of your architecture it's really

1381
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:29,760
critical because if you're trying to

1382
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,599
assemble after the fact you're like is

1383
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,920
this a normal error rate i like i don't

1384
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,880
know

1385
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,480
um you know is this the right number of

1386
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,000
routes i should be receiving from this

1387
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:38,960
network

1388
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,880
um you know and and you see recent

1389
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,480
outage like i can think of one that was

1390
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,800
very public uh and caught a lot of media

1391
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,640
attention but there have been almost a

1392
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:47,680
dozen

1393
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,440
uh different backbones that have had

1394
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,240
issues since that since that large one

1395
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,319
uh in in various different shapes over

1396
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:57,119
the past you know three weeks as well

1397
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,280
and so you know i don't even know which

1398
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,480
one you're talking about there have been

1399
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,839
so many

1400
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,839
um you know not a backbone it wasn't a

1401
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,760
backbone

1402
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,680
well if it was not primarily about yeah

1403
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,400
yeah i think we can say facebook right

1404
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,160
yeah i think that's right i think that's

1405
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,480
what we're talking about

1406
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,160
yes yeah i'm surprised it took that long

1407
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,119
for us to that to come up in our in this

1408
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,800
panel but yeah so we've got a very meta

1409
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,920
topic we've had f-bombs on this

1410
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,520
um

1411
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,839
let's see yes so uh

1412
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,319
on that one you know people use facebook

1413
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:33,119
as a authentication to reach other sites

1414
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,599
so then things completely unrelated but

1415
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,040
uh saved for authentication uh became

1416
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,200
inaccessible and then you know competing

1417
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,480
we had some different stats with

1418
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,400
somebody named mark tinkus uh put up saw

1419
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,119
udp spike didn't we did see uh we just

1420
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,160
we saw the spike in port 53 of the

1421
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,240
retries that um

1422
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,599
and this is kentic data i'm talking

1423
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,200
about um

1424
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,760
we we did see an uptick in some you know

1425
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,839
the competing social media so

1426
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:04,079
uh twitter um for us when i looked um

1427
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,480
netflix looked it was hard to see the

1428
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,880
difference some other people have said

1429
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,800
it has uh there was you know mark i

1430
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,559
think wrote in the download list that it

1431
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,720
was uh he saw a three-time spike in

1432
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,480
traffic to nano i guess everybody as

1433
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,319
soon as they can't get facebook

1434
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,240
fire up a movie i guess

1435
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,839
i cannot confirm or deny that

1436
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:24,960
maybe

1437
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,640
uh

1438
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,559
beyond that yeah the

1439
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,920
the dns one uh kind of like i think um

1440
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,359
uh damien from google as uh in his talk

1441
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,359
uh a few nanooks ago and made a comment

1442
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:38,559
about how

1443
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,559
people misinterpret uh dns floods uh as

1444
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,480
a ddos attack when it's really as an

1445
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,880
outage that all there's all this dns

1446
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,160
traffic that uh gets uh gets messed up

1447
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,800
as a result of uh on

1448
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,280
um all the uh unreachables coming back i

1449
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,440
want one as to rule them all and in the

1450
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,760
dns bind them yes

1451
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,119
yes

1452
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:02,640
thank you chris warren i think you're

1453
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,680
next thanks warren murray google

1454
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:08,800
so when 7007 happened a bunch of people

1455
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,720
on nano kind of got bent out of shape

1456
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,480
and there was some discussion

1457
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,559
but recently when like a social media

1458
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,400
site goes down like everybody loses

1459
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,079
their mind and there's mass drama and

1460
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,839
the congress gets involved and all sorts

1461
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,520
of things like that

1462
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,400
this means either one we can't have any

1463
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,920
more outages or two we need a better way

1464
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,599
of explaining to the public why this

1465
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,359
stuff is hard

1466
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:32,960
is there some way that we can explain

1467
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,200
that networks are now complex and you

1468
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,720
know it's not the same as what you have

1469
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,920
in your house

1470
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,559
in the world do we just not

1471
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,359
i mean 1997 was also a long time ago the

1472
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:44,559
internet was still relatively new for a

1473
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,079
lot of people so i think the question

1474
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,079
the question exists today so i had a lot

1475
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,920
of media inquiries about outages so i

1476
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,000
think like in

1477
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,280
june

1478
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,440
we had both like fascinating akamai both

1479
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,240
had i think pretty short-lived outages

1480
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,160
and i was talking to a reporter from new

1481
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,920
york times they were like how can this

1482
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,760
possibly be and i was like well i don't

1483
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,119
look at it the other way like this is

1484
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:07,280
they were recovered in 50 minutes

1485
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,280
um i don't know like i was like there's

1486
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,960
no error-free internet

1487
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,800
uh every every network's going to make a

1488
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,720
mistake it's just a matter of how fast

1489
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,520
can you get the thing back up i was like

1490
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,599
i would look at this as a success

1491
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,040
replace

1492
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,640
the general public

1493
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,319
with your boss

1494
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,440
the ceo the developer the application

1495
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,040
people the people that think that

1496
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,240
network is apis and none of us exist

1497
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,240
right as russ white i don't know if it

1498
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,640
was his quoter said he

1499
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,319
he said

1500
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:40,559
automation does not mean simplicity

1501
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,280
right it may look simple but underneath

1502
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,280
you know it's still complex

1503
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,880
so do we have a pr agency for the

1504
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,880
industry is there is that an analog

1505
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,480
function

1506
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,400
well and for and for me the type of

1507
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,160
complexity that gets introduced into the

1508
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,000
network is generally all around the

1509
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,400
business logic as well is that oh i

1510
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,800
can't send this traffic this way

1511
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,040
because of because of something and so a

1512
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,960
lot of these things the ultimate root of

1513
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,559
them is actually the business

1514
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,319
implications and you need to evaluate

1515
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,559
the risk of whatever the technical

1516
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,480
change you're doing within the lens of

1517
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,640
that business risk as well

1518
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,160
or the business optimization you're

1519
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,680
making you know the whole reason for

1520
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,200
peering is is largely not to say you

1521
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,200
know uh you know hey i have more peers

1522
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,920
than you uh or to say i've got the most

1523
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,400
or whatever it's largely about you're

1524
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,160
trying to optimize your business case

1525
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,839
such that your costs are lower and

1526
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:33,440
you're more competitive as a direct

1527
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,480
result

1528
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,720
or control but yeah yeah

1529
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,160
if you have a pr agency but maybe

1530
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,480
outside of doug's twitter feed

1531
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,839
the outages list does that run on you're

1532
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:44,079
really pushing it yeah the outages list

1533
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,400
is maybe the closest thing we've got

1534
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,680
and we've got just so you know we've got

1535
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,640
about six minutes so if you roughly

1536
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,000
by the time between the last two people

1537
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,280
at the mic

1538
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,119
hi uh colin mcintosh netflix

1539
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,720
even shorter than that we have maybe an

1540
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,000
online question or two so i'll take

1541
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,760
those after year sure

1542
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,800
um

1543
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,599
a uh famous internet outage that i was

1544
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,440
not involved in but uh always comes to

1545
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,599
mind was in 2001 there was a

1546
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,640
csx train derailment in a uh in the

1547
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:16,319
howard street tunnel in baltimore

1548
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,480
baltimore yeah and as i remember the

1549
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,880
story or as i was told uh

1550
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,559
basically what happened was the train

1551
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,400
derailed and there was a fire in the

1552
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,200
tunnel for six days and on one side of

1553
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,200
the tunnel was a fiber path and on the

1554
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,920
other side of the tunnel was the diverse

1555
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,440
fiber path

1556
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,480
uh which of course the fire melted both

1557
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,400
of them um

1558
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,599
i think we've seen a couple other

1559
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:40,960
situations

1560
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,280
where disasters have affected uh

1561
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,520
diversity and capacity on the internet

1562
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,640
um

1563
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,880
as that uh outage did and i'm wondering

1564
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,960
if you think that now 20 years on from

1565
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,280
that event we're in a better place where

1566
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,640
major disasters natural or not will uh

1567
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,280
have an effect on uh internet capacity

1568
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,880
and diversity or if you think we're in a

1569
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,960
better place now

1570
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,960
i think it's better not perfect

1571
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,040
you know we had cross-country stuff we

1572
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,960
had buildings with what's marketing we

1573
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,880
call collapsed sonnet which means both

1574
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,200
sides of it run in the same conduit but

1575
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,280
it seems like it's better overall

1576
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,200
yeah i would say largely outside of the

1577
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,319
sub c environment uh it's largely better

1578
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:21,200
also

1579
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,640
the customers are a lot more

1580
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,319
sophisticated in how they're buying the

1581
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,000
services that doesn't mean that the

1582
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,440
carriers don't go and groom you or

1583
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,760
whatever but aside from you know there's

1584
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,040
the uh sumatra quake uh you know the the

1585
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,800
uh it was the day after christmas or

1586
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,400
whatever that caused a lot of cable

1587
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,680
system uh outages in asia as well as the

1588
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:43,040
there is the uh tohoku quake um you know

1589
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,119
back that also triggered like fukushima

1590
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,040
and some of the other events and uh

1591
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,720
those impacted a lot of subsea cable

1592
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,599
systems and and those continue to remain

1593
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,680
some of the places where uh things are

1594
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,480
very vulnerable um we i know we've faced

1595
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,160
outages from uh uh you know recently

1596
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,119
even this year on sub sea where because

1597
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:06,319
of kovid uh the crews couldn't come into

1598
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,559
the country to pick up supplies to go

1599
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,200
back out to do repairs um because they

1600
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,119
would have to quarantine you know 14

1601
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,599
days upon arrival into the countries uh

1602
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:16,880
just because they were coming from you

1603
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,119
know the sea so yeah i think it depends

1604
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,960
like generally a land-based thing is

1605
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,839
going to be a lot easier to recover

1606
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,119
let's see if michael has a question

1607
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,640
first from online

1608
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:32,079
statements

1609
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,799
am i yes dan

1610
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:37,440
has a question here or a statement he

1611
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,720
was working for

1612
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,280
some academic folks in india in the

1613
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,400
1990s and there was an outage for a week

1614
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,240
and it turned out that people had stolen

1615
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,680
the copper lines going into the

1616
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,200
university

1617
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,760
he then replies they replace

1618
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,920
the fiber and part of the copper and it

1619
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,880
was stolen again

1620
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,160
brian has a question here where he asks

1621
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,400
content application is critical if i can

1622
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,040
stop the content application i can make

1623
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:08,240
the system useless even though it is up

1624
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,839
in quotes

1625
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,680
how does the panel feel about the

1626
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,640
reference to government censorship and

1627
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,558
the great firewall of china

1628
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,040
bit of a loaded question

1629
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,559
is it i don't know if we have enough

1630
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:25,839
time to really get into that one we

1631
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:27,119
really literally have like two minutes

1632
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,200
left it hasn't had an outage yet maybe a

1633
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,760
future panel yeah future panel

1634
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,359
and then i have one last state they can

1635
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:35,359
reach facebook read the last one the

1636
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,280
last statement is there's been some

1637
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,400
notable cascading dns failures like the

1638
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,760
yahoo im incident in 2001 caused by

1639
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,799
yahoo blocking tcp 53 to the

1640
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:50,400
authoritative dns servers dns service

1641
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,119
and the massive one in china in 2009

1642
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,160
related to the ddos attack against

1643
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,040
an

1644
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,839
authoritative dns server for a

1645
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:04,480
popular p2p file sharing application

1646
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,240
okay thank you michael i think those are

1647
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,400
more statements and questions we have

1648
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,799
very briefly in the back sure kevin lock

1649
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:13,680
qts referring back to the major outage

1650
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,119
this year with the social media company

1651
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,040
i think i read that was initially

1652
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,119
triggered by a automation in-house

1653
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:20,960
automation tool that that had a bug in

1654
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,280
it how concerned is the panel

1655
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,799
that there's a lot of automation

1656
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,799
increasingly deployed everywhere

1657
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,640
obviously it's required at a certain

1658
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,880
scale how much fragility you think might

1659
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,160
be baked in

1660
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,160
bugs you won't you won't discover until

1661
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,559
it and until it matters the most

1662
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:37,680
very like

1663
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,839
when you guys had the comment about uh

1664
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,440
you know automation right complex very

1665
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,920
concerned much fragility be careful and

1666
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,359
fast please

1667
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:48,640
yeah yeah i'm i'm gonna say uh

1668
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,480
you know similar to what avi said is

1669
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,799
that uh it's still humans behind all of

1670
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:55,599
those applications uh you know in coding

1671
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,160
stuff and as creative as we may think we

1672
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:58,960
are

1673
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,280
you know it's very complex to you know

1674
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,880
for human to think of all the different

1675
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,640
failure modes

1676
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,119
but i do think at the exact same time

1677
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,359
compared to where we were

1678
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,520
20 plus years ago

1679
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,000
you know back to the 7007 incident

1680
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,839
the networks are far more

1681
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,799
resilient converge so much faster and

1682
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,720
the time to restoration you know for

1683
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,400
many of these things tends to actually

1684
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,640
be relatively quick you know there's the

1685
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,319
gentleman who got up and talked about

1686
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:27,599
you know it took a couple days to

1687
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,520
recover from the morris worm i mean

1688
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,119
we're talking about things where the

1689
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,359
outage duration is

1690
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:35,760
uh you know measured in you know hours

1691
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,559
for these major catastrophic incidents

1692
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,280
um and when and when there's you know

1693
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,880
either sub-seed cable outages or

1694
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,480
something like that you see the carriers

1695
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,400
all get together and actually do swaps

1696
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,359
on the

1697
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:49,200
the systems that are up but when it

1698
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,040
comes to automation i mean

1699
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,599
we've got we've got a lot of stuff where

1700
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:55,119
uh you know

1701
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,119
it's entirely possible that the systems

1702
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:00,000
may may cause an outage but at the same

1703
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,319
time you know we continue to learn from

1704
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,480
our mistakes and at least at my company

1705
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,559
we've got a good culture of going in

1706
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,079
reviewing the mistakes and trying to

1707
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:09,520
figure out okay how can we improve this

1708
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,280
and make this better every time

1709
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,480
one last statement i would make the

1710
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,319
caution and this on that note is the

1711
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:15,599
thing i've observed is that a lot of

1712
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,520
people who write the automation stuff

1713
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,359
are not the people who truly under have

1714
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,280
the big picture like the in the old days

1715
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,559
where it was one person who understood

1716
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,720
the network there's a there's a split

1717
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:27,119
often between the coders now the devops

1718
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:30,160
people and the network people

1719
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,960
maybe

1720
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,720
all right with that

1721
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,319
thank you very much for and thank the

1722
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,000
audience for your participation i think

1723
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,079
we come to inclusion michael sorry maybe

1724
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,119
i'm entered too late fine uh

1725
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:46,880
we can get a nice round of applause for

1726
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,400
these four gentlemen up here for this

1727
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,920
wonderful panel

1728
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,559
thank you john avi jared and doug

1729

thank you
