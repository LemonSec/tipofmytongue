25
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,879
[Music]

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,600
thank you okay so the agenda that i want

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,200
to put forth today

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,560
again we're talking about the internet

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,479
routing registry what is it and then how

30
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,760
is it used

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,920
why is it still important and why is it

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,920
relevant

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,000
go into the different types of objects

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,439
that are available

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,680
to operators to to create and to enter

36
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,159
their records in into the irr databases

37
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,040
explain how those objects are used

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,360
and then give uh give a sense of what's

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,600
coming and go a little bit further into

40
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,680
uh what john was referring to with the

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,079
changes in the aaron and

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,880
non-authenticated irr sunset let's call

43
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,759
it that

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,780
next slide please

45
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,520
[Music]

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,159
so essentially there are a number of

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,159
routing security data sets

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,840
rpki is let's call it the new shiny uh

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,799
it's it's the newest arrival but

50
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,880
for the better part of 20 22 23 years

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,920
the irr has been a a

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,119
bellwether stand stalwart method of

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,480
allowing

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,520
an operator to identify the product the

55
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,000
the resources that they have and

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,400
basically pass on that information to

57
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,640
the greater internet in a way that is

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,200
more open and openly available

59
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,280
um and then there's everything else

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,160
basically since the days bgp was was

61
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,080
announced that was that was what we had

62
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,599
in the beginning so

63
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,560
let's go ahead and move forward next

64
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,000
slide

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,440
so what is the irr well the irr is a

66
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,920
a an ecosystem run by no one individual

67
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,000
one one company uh it's it's not overly

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,640
regulated in the sense that there are uh

69
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,160
rules and and

70
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,040
and

71
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,720
specific methods that have to be

72
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,760
followed from one database operator to

73
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,360
another next slide please so i

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,200
unfortunately will read this entire

75
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,280
definition for those who may or may not

76
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,080
know what the irr is the internet

77
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,239
routing registry or irr

78
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,879
is a distributed routing based a routing

79
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,200
database development effort

80
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,280
the data from the irr

81
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,920
may be used by anyone worldwide to help

82
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,040
debug configure and engineer

83
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,120
internet routing and addressing

84
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,959
the ir provides a mechanism for

85
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,799
validating the contents of bgp

86
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,599
announcement messages or mapping an

87
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,680
origin asn number to a list of networks

88
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,360
there's a whole lot of words there

89
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,400
there's

90
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,720
maybe some confusion there so next slide

91
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,799
i i have my own definition of what the

92
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,760
ir is and that is it's a way to share

93
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,480
information about you and your customers

94
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,280
with the other network operators out in

95
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,080
the uh out of the internet

96
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,200
next slide please so what is the irr

97
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,640
really all about

98
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,480
essentially it is

99
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,360
there to provide directions to get to

100
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,959
the destination you want

101
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,680
it's the destination you want

102
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,000
operators on the network to come to to

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,839
get to your content or the content of

104
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,000
your customers

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,720
now we all made travel reservations to

106
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,680
get here we all made sure that we booked

107
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,560
the

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,240
sunny warm trade winds of minneapolis to

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,639
get here

110
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,320
but in a sense the ir works the same way

111
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,720
you go and you look at this

112
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,479
large information

113
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,880
a database listed that has your flights

114
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,000
and your times and and you get here um

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,880
just by virtue of someone else making

116
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,960
the announcement that here's the way to

117
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,360
get to the plane the flight and get your

118
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,600
ultimate destination

119
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,080
next slide

120
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,880
so there are two

121
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,240
ways uh two different mindsets

122
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,039
of irr databases and organizations that

123
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,639
run irr databases on the internet

124
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,600
they can be validated or not validated

125
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,120
let me go a little bit into that so

126
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,600
most of the irr databases that exist

127
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,759
today of which there's more than 20 run

128
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,560
by different organizations

129
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,360
do not have a method or vehicle with

130
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,880
which to confirm or authenticate

131
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,360
validate that the information in the

132
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,919
object in that record in the database

133
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,960
is in fact true

134
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,759
there's nothing stopping an individual

135
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,080
from creating a record in

136
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,320
a third party database

137
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,080
and claim

138
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,479
a prefix just should be coming from

139
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,400
their asn there's no way to to restrict

140
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,638
that

141
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,319
let me give you an analogy

142
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,560
some of us hopefully are fans of a

143
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,400
professional sports team

144
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,759
and when that that team signs a new star

145
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,560
player everybody goes out and gets their

146
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,400
own new jersey with the name of the

147
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,199
number on the back very proud

148
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,800
but over time

149
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,039
this individual will want to make more

150
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,680
money and will transfer to a different

151
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,080
team somewhere else in another city but

152
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,199
you are still a fan of that person and

153
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,840
you are still a fan of your team your

154
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
team affiliation didn't change

155
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,240
so you now have a jersey that isn't

156
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,080
exactly accurate

157
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,800
you you have the person's name but

158
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,199
you're identifying a different team so

159
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,440
maybe your information in this case is a

160
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,720
little stale or arguably incorrect

161
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,400
however

162
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,960
if you wanted to get a jersey for your

163
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,759
your

164
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,240
your star player that you like to follow

165
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,120
but you don't want to

166
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,440
make sure excuse me you don't have the

167
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,400
uh

168
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,440
the the wherewithal to pay the hefty fee

169
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,440
to get the jersey from the team directly

170
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,720
there's somebody that's out there in the

171
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,800
parking lot when you're tailgating

172
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,599
we'll give you a a sham shirt

173
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,400
uh it it may or not be genuine

174
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,880
arguably it probably isn't

175
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,440
and that's that same mindset works in

176
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,199
the irr

177
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,639
there's information that when it was

178
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,319
created it was good

179
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,560
and over time that information

180
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,120
and it's it's legitimacy has kind of

181
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,199
faded

182
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,199
and there are people out there that are

183
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,280
doing malicious things in the ir and we

184
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,960
need to be aware of that

185
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,520
so what is the flip side the flip side

186
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,160
is a validated database a database in

187
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,960
which

188
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,280
the resource

189
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,240
holders have been

190
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,199
given the rights to use

191
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,080
internet number resources from the irrs

192
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,879
or the rars excuse me the rirs are the

193
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,960
only ones that have the ability to

194
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,160
confirm

195
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,560
that organization x

196
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,840
has been allocated these blocks

197
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,759
and can assure everyone who looks at an

198
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,000
authenticated database the data is

199
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,280
correct

200
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,599
next slide please

201
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,319
so

202
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,479
what what is the database made of the

203
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,639
database is made of records and they're

204
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,720
called objects i want to go through a

205
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,160
few of the objects that are most

206
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,759
commonly used

207
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,440
and give an explanation of how they work

208
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,159
next slide please

209
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,958
so the first of which is called the

210
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,200
route object and the route object

211
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,958
is the fundamental building block of the

212
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,679
irr it's information that basically

213
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,320
states this this route this prefix

214
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,720
should be coming from this asn

215
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,920
this is the way it needs to go

216
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,880
about 80 percent of the records inside

217
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,640
of aaron's database

218
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,920
are route objects clearly the most used

219
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,399
bit of information that operators like

220
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,279
you will put into the irr

221
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,800
and don't forget ipv6 is a thing so if

222
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
it's a route object it could be a route

223
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,959
6 object thank you

224
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,040
next slide please so here's an example

225
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,120
of a route object

226
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,480
i

227
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,680
run the sesame street isp hi my name is

228
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,839
ernie

229
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,279
i have a prefix that is has been given

230
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,600
to me by aaron in this case and i have

231
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,000
an asm and i put this information in

232
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,760
this route object

233
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
to say

234
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,440
this is where you you want to go to get

235
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,680
to my prefix now there's optional

236
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,120
information

237
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,880
in this case a descriptions field where

238
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,959
you can put whatever you choose you

239
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,560
don't have to put them in but you can be

240
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,959
as give as much information as you

241
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,080
choose so that is useful to

242
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,360
people who are going to look at your

243
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,680
record

244
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,760
now

245
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
in the case of aaron i wanted to call

246
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,519
out something here

247
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,360
the main buy the maintainer of a a

248
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,680
record inside of the database

249
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,680
is directly linked to the organization

250
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,360
name so

251
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,480
mnt ssisp is the sesame street isp

252
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,000
organization name just want to call it

253
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,640
out next slide please

254
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,279
the next most commonly used object or

255
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,680
created object is the otnum object and

256
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,880
that is

257
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,920
clear this represents a single as

258
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,880
and and you know the policies associated

259
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,040
with it that you want to create so it is

260
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,839
a

261
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:34,640
uh

262
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,279
it can range from simple to very complex

263
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,079
given the amount of of of

264
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,560
specifics and and and

265
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,240
data that you want to put into your

266
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,440
object

267
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,240
but essentially it is

268
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
telling who you want to talk to and who

269
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,320
you want

270
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,560
to know of

271
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,959
information that is is associated with

272
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,320
your asn

273
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,680
next slide please

274
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,079
so here's the example of an autonomous

275
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,959
num uh num object again my asn 65501 or

276
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,120
64501 excuse me

277
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,040
is associated with my isp and isp

278
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,440
and it gives the opportunity for

279
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,240
operators to pull this information and

280
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720
put it into their policy and say hey

281
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,480
enos isp is this asn it is descriptive

282
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,600
rather than just a number

283
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,720
and i can make a a statement about who

284
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,760
am i going to listen to and who i am

285
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,480
going to pass my information along to

286
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
inside of this autonomous system there's

287
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,800
this otnum object it's optional you

288
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
don't need to put that there but it it

289
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,839
gives you

290
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,360
a more granular knob uh to use to put

291
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,640
inside of

292
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,200
inside of the database next slide please

293
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,560
um as set so exactly what it sounds like

294
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,639
you now have an as object that you can

295
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,839
put in multiple asms and it gives you

296
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,279
a way to

297
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,760
identify a single element

298
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,040
with many different

299
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,519
many different components buried within

300
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,320
it you can use it to categorize for

301
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,639
example all your customer networks

302
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,399
next next

303
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,800
so here is a something that starts to

304
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,000
look familiar

305
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,839
you have the asn but i have now a group

306
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,880
of sesame street isp customers society

307
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,320
that represents the asn's of

308
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,480
cookie monster's bakery and oscar's

309
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,079
trash service

310
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,279
and

311
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,639
people out

312
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,920
distant don't need to know that they

313
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,320
just need to reference the ssisp

314
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,399
customer record

315
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,639
i maintain it and everyone else just can

316
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,079
move along next slide please

317
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,600
finally there's the route set object

318
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,800
again very similar to asset you can

319
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,399
group together prefixes under one record

320
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:57,760
to to

321
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,959
reduce the complexity of

322
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,839
the overall databases and it gives you

323
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,760
the creator of the object the

324
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,279
opportunity to

325
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,279
have one location where you need to do

326
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,399
updates if if your customer base changes

327
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,680
next slide please

328
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,160
so here's a final example again you know

329
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,680
i i am

330
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,160
sesame street customers

331
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
here are the member

332
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,279
prefixes of my my

333
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,920
you know child customers information and

334
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
all i need to do is if i add a new

335
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,399
customer or remove or lose one i just

336
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,360
remove

337
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,839
one of those member prefixes and

338
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,320
everything else remains the same in your

339
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,160
policy your filtering that you put in

340
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,519
place next slide please

341
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,560
great so

342
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,959
you've created your objects

343
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,920
now what do you do with them

344
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,680
this tool is a great way

345
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,160
to get beyond the buddy system of

346
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,920
networking

347
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,959
early on all we could do was

348
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,839
expect or hope that the network that

349
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,440
connected up to you

350
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,680
was giving you valid information about

351
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,720
what was beyond them you can talk to

352
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,639
your direct peer but three hops down the

353
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,920
way you have no information and no no

354
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,600
method with which to communicate with

355
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,120
those people to understand what they

356
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,519
want you to know

357
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,600
so this is how you you get it done next

358
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,000
slide please

359
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,160
inside of

360
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,720
the databases themselves

361
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,680
there are

362
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,839
methods with which you can pull excuse

363
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,160
me inside there are methods with which

364
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,600
you can pull

365
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,639
information in all of the ir databases

366
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,880
that will assist in

367
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,160
a

368
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,360
way of a close to real-time or real-time

369
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,480
monitoring

370
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,959
for your filters you can build them and

371
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,839
it will be relatively seamless and move

372
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,600
forward and you don't have to go back

373
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,560
and revisit your filters every time a

374
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
change is made

375
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,320
alternatively

376
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,519
you can pull

377
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,519
the information down from any of these

378
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,560
databases on one fell swoop download it

379
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,519
and then

380
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,480
rebuild overnight for example

381
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,199
the records are created and

382
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,440
updated immediately but if you don't

383
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,880
want or need a real-time fix then you

384
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,240
know that that

385
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,959
full download of the databases uh is

386
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,800
useful to you

387
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,880
once you download that information just

388
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,199
decide what you want to use and and you

389
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,880
know where you want to put it

390
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,040
since there are so many databases that

391
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,040
have either different or copies of

392
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,040
information from one or the other you

393
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,800
can select which

394
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,000
information source you plan to use to

395
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,040
end up

396
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,839
creating your filters

397
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,560
thanks so

398
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,880
i'm going to self-serve myself a little

399
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,199
bit here and john started to allude to

400
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,800
this when he was when he was up here a

401
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,240
few minutes ago

402
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,680
aaron runs

403
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,959
two different irr databases

404
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,360
one has been around is very long in the

405
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,480
tooth

406
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
there is information that is in it that

407
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,519
has been

408
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,000
aged out long forgotten

409
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,320
people don't know it's even there people

410
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,279
who created them don't work there or in

411
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,320
the industry anymore

412
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,360
and we need with the title of the of the

413
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
presentation we need to clean up this

414
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,759
information and make the irr relevant

415
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,519
once again

416
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,360
next slide please

417
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,079
so

418
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,600
way back when

419
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,399
uh aaron as one of the irs ran

420
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,839
and continues to run

421
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,680
a unvalidated or an unauthenticated

422
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,560
non-authenticated ir database

423
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,680
it was

424
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,279
uh as stated before it was an

425
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,720
alternative to

426
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,320
hoping

427
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,800
that operators down the way were getting

428
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,480
the information to you that you wanted

429
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,359
to see

430
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,319
but there was no guarantee and the irr

431
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,240
gave the opportunity for those distant

432
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,959
operator networks to give

433
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,280
more useful or more valid more

434
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,240
readily available information to people

435
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,480
further out from them so it was it

436
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,599
really was the first

437
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,840
opportunity and the first big step

438
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,320
towards providing routing security

439
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,039
beyond what was just available to bgp in

440
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,080
in

441
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,960
in and by itself

442
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,320
fundamentally

443
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,080
things haven't changed since these

444
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,520
databases were first created all those

445
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,000
years ago

446
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,679
incrementally aaron updated information

447
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,799
uh incrementally aaron updated ways to

448
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,679
update to enter and remove records from

449
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,559
the databases but essentially

450
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,799
it looks the same as it did

451
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,160
way back when

452
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,880
when fire was invented the ir doesn't

453
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
really look any different

454
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,400
other than there's a whole lot more

455
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,320
records than originally were put in

456
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,120
place

457
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,360
but the membership of aaron asked for

458
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,760
something new and this is what we came

459
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,799
up with

460
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,600
next slide please

461
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,480
so

462
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,720
aaron's authenticated irr

463
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,840
was requested through our suggestion

464
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,440
processes at aaron

465
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,799
and we

466
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,400
came up with a solution that provided a

467
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,280
completely new build of the ir

468
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,200
as it was compared to what we had

469
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,440
previously been running

470
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,160
versus this new authenticated

471
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,559
it was internally developed

472
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,120
it gave

473
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,799
a full integration we built full

474
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,960
integration to our online

475
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,480
aaron online tool

476
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,320
it gave us opportun the the api

477
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,559
where you programmatically could just

478
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,240
access and pull the information that

479
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,799
wasn't available before previously all

480
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,360
of the updates were through you know a

481
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,880
mail interface

482
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,200
which is great but it's

483
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,440
it wasn't what was being asked for and

484
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,080
it wasn't what should be available today

485
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,120
so

486
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,919
in june of last year uh the air and

487
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,640
authenticated database came online

488
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,120
well received everyone was thankful for

489
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,640
it and we have continued to do

490
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,720
incremental development on features and

491
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,480
capabilities of this database and we are

492
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,760
listening to

493
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,559
our our community our membership to say

494
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,120
please tell us more of what you want to

495
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,039
see is are there enhancements you would

496
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,080
like

497
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,039
and

498
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,280
definitely come to me and i i will bring

499
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,240
those

500
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,280
those requests back to uh back to aaron

501
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,440
and we can work on development and and

502
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,039
and get the

503
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,360
get uh fixes or implement the new

504
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,719
features that you're asking for

505
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,799
and like i said it gives us multiple

506
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,640
ways or gets you multiple voice to get

507
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,760
the data in and out of of the database

508
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,480
wow john it really gave me a lot of time

509
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280
next slide please

510
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,280
so

511
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,360
aaron doesn't want to run two databases

512
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,880
clearly

513
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,760
we don't want to have

514
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,880
a

515
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,919
repository of information that we know

516
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,200
is full of questionable or otherwise

517
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,880
completely incorrect data

518
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,480
the aaron the the non-authentic database

519
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,600
is still growing

520
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,120
and we certainly don't want that to

521
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,000
happen

522
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,480
we want to make sure that people who

523
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
create their records are going to get

524
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,559
them installed in a location that could

525
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,039
be identified as

526
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,159
this is good info you don't have to

527
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,799
question where it came from it is

528
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,200
it is information that has been checked

529
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,840
by aaron

530
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,240
to be true that the creator of the

531
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,200
object is in fact the organization that

532
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,480
is the

533
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,159
the receiver

534
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,360
of the resource that's being created

535
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,280
and that opportunity isn't available to

536
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,880
other uh

537
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,000
other irr operators save the the other

538
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,080
rirs

539
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,000
next slide please

540
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,120
so

541
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,360
it's time to say goodbye

542
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,679
uh in in march of this year

543
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:34,559
we

544
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,559
we erin had a consultation with the

545
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,039
community where we solicited

546
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,679
your feedback uh we shared our plans

547
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,600
with what we were going to do

548
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,799
with this

549
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,880
database we want to

550
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,640
stop providing the data stream from

551
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,000
originally

552
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,640
june excuse me originally september 30th

553
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,760
was the day

554
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,240
and six months was very quickly rejected

555
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,000
as a

556
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,200
time frame to have people prepare

557
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,919
so we agreed that we would give 12

558
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,919
months for everyone to be made aware

559
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,120
give them the opportunity to be prepared

560
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,559
and and

561
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,760
then

562
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,840
aaron would move forward and stop the

563
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,080
announcement of this database but

564
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,120
march 31st 2022 is coming it's coming

565
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,840
faster than what many people have

566
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,919
believed and

567
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,280
it's only 154 days away if my math is

568
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,360
right

569
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,200
there are many organizations that really

570
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,480
don't have a lot of records in the

571
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,600
database but there are a few that have

572
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,000
many records in the database

573
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,159
we've been doing our research and

574
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,200
these operators have records only in

575
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,840
aaron's database so you can imagine if

576
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,480
the data stream stops for

577
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,480
65 000 objects in our database that

578
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,200
don't already have

579
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,360
a new location

580
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,960
a new database to have this data entered

581
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,679
it's gonna cause some problems

582
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,400
so please

583
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,080
pay attention

584
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,919
make plans

585
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,360
now after uh march we sent out uh

586
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,640
notifications of the the intent

587
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,240
for this

588
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,880
for this shutdown and it was sent to all

589
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,320
of um

590
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,080
aaron's

591
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,919
technical points of contact and the

592
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,360
administrative points of contact

593
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,159
we got more kickbacks than we did

594
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,880
positive answers uh from people

595
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,799
so it is

596
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,000
imperative that

597
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,799
i come our communications team relays

598
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,200
we we send additional

599
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,600
methods or different ways of getting

600
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,320
this information out

601
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,240
people really need to prepare

602
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,440
the deadline is coming

603
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,240
so moving forward we will continue

604
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,279
to have

605
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,240
um additional emails going out which

606
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,880
unfortunately we know has not been very

607
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,679
very useful at this point but we

608
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,840
we sometimes have no other means of

609
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,159
getting in contact with

610
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,919
people who are responsible for for

611
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,320
running an organization so if you

612
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,720
haven't done so in a while please go

613
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,679
log into your account verify your email

614
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,640
address

615
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,320
and then uh

616
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,159
pay attention take a look and see what's

617
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,000
there so there's some pretty interesting

618
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,760
information i'm sure in your inbox and

619

take a look at your objects that are in

632
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,880
in in the database and maybe they really

633
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,880
aren't pertinent anymore we can get rid

634
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,320
of them

635
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,039
and then you can forget about it and say

636
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,960

646
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,400

that's that's all i have and you have

668
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,820
any questions

669
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:37,119
[Music]

670
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,880
um i heard you say that

671
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,679
you have done research to see which

672
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,440
records only exist in the erin non auth

673
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,880
irr is that true and have you identified

674
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,960
the percentage of those records

675
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,640
of the total database

676
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,480
yes we have um

677
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,720
just recently we pulled the information

678
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,760
out uh as we noted an increase in the

679
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,279
number of records unfortunately that

680
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,720
were in there

681
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,919
there are

682
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,919
two organizations

683
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,240
that will remain nameless

684
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,640
that are responsible for 68 of the

685
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,520
records in the database just two

686
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,960
one of them is responsible for 62 000 of

687
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,880
them now

688
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,240
individually they only have their

689
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,320
records in the erin database yes we

690
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,720
we've done searches through

691
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,679
radbeam for example and there are

692
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,880
no other records that radbee either has

693
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,200
directly in their in their database or

694
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
mirrored from somewhere else

695
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,080
so that there are many many many

696
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,000
thousands tens of thousands of objects

697
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,880
that only exist in the air and non-auth

698
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,520
database and they continue to grow

699
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,960
and are we looking at trying to contact

700
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,640
the

701
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,399
networks that are actually announcing

702
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,000
these records

703
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,640
via the current errand point of contacts

704
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,399
for those asn's

705
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,880
so that you know maybe the record itself

706
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,640
has a dead contact information in it but

707
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,559
maybe the as for

708
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,240
the network that is actually announcing

709
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,720
them is uh correct so

710
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,679
um doing the next level of database

711
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,520
lookup to see if we can actually get

712
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,200
someone to

713
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
look at the record who is actually

714
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,039
announcing it now and then just make it

715
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:39,919
a

716
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,440
informed decision about what they want

717
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,279
to do with the database absolutely

718
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,480
absolutely so

719
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,679
um you know the top i'm

720
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,840
the top record holders in the database

721
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,720
are well-known organizations that we do

722
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,640
have direct contacts with

723
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,080
and we have reached out to the top ten

724
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,279
proactively and communicated with them

725
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,120
telephone zoom what you know whatever

726
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,159
method

727
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,799
that we are working with them to

728
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,480
develop their plan certainly have

729
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,279
identified uh you know what their

730
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,919
condition is as a result um but one of

731
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,440
them actually has come back and said

732
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,320
well that's okay let it all go away

733
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,000
i'm gonna i'm gonna start my own

734
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,200
database

735
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,640
fantastic okay all right so no we have

736
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,960
been reaching out to to

737
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,799
the the ones who will be impacted the

738
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,559
most but

739
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,399
like i was saying there are a number of

740
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,919
organizations that have data that have

741
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,279
been out there for

742
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,840
15 years that just it's it's old and

743
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,960
stale people don't know about it

744
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,559
microphone the middleware room

745
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,399
kevin bloomberg the wire uh two

746
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,879
questions

747
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,919
do you have an idea of what the total

748
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,720
percentage of ip space

749
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,120
uh that aaron has is off today

750
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,959
don't directly have that

751
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,840
i can't uh

752
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,480
give you a clear answer of

753
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,240
what the full resource use um or of the

754
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,880
the aaron allocated addresses that that

755
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,799
they have that they're responsible for

756
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,600
is in the authenticated database um

757
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,440
it's actually a lookup that we we

758
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,600
haven't pulled off so it's something i

759
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,200
can definitely look into

760
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,000
um but the the number of objects in the

761
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,159
authenticated database are twice the

762
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,880
size of the non-auth database which is

763
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,159
promising and that is growing as well um

764
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,159
but no i i don't have a clear answer to

765
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,360
that first question i think it's

766
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,200
important for the community to have an

767
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,840
idea of how we're improving

768
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,440
auth is critical

769
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,399
um non-auth is bad auth is critical and

770
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,640
if we don't know how we're improving as

771
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,440
a

772
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,159
community we're going to have problems

773
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,080
second question

774
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,360
are you able to in the air and online

775
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,919
off system to delegate

776
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,360
a prefix so that a

777
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,919
a customer of mine who has a 24 as an

778
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,640
example is able to maintain

779
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,080
that 24 within my block or is it that

780
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,799
i'm responsible for it solely

781
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,360
so a lot of the

782
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,559
the

783
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,000
information that ends up landing in the

784
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,200
non-off database is related to proxy

785
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
objects many many of them are proxy

786
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,600
objects

787
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,519
if your customer is a

788
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,159
member organization of aaron it's very

789
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,200
it's

790
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,159
um

791
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,840
there is an opportunity

792
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,640
uh

793
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,320
to make that

794
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,480
useful to you in in the case of your

795
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,279
customers but i don't have a

796
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,640
no

797
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,840
the the example is specifically okay

798
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,320
john sweeting with uh aaron uh yeah if

799
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,240
you have uh

800
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,519
um assigned reassigned or reallocated to

801
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,679
your customer they can manage their own

802
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,080
objects as long as it's under

803
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,640
rsa or lr say by you

804
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,919
that's the answer

805
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,600
thank you john thank you so that would

806
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,159
address the proxy scenario as long as

807
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,320
i'm maintaining my records correctly

808
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,760
delegating them

809
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,480
to my customers

810
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,240
they don't need to be a non-off they can

811
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,919
deal with it enough correct thank you

812
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,760
okay we have

813
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,760
a handful of questions from remote

814
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,200
participants uh

815
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,720
i will start with start at the top here

816
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,159
maybe more than a handful here but we've

817
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,720
got about 10 minutes

818
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,640
i'll start with a question from michael

819
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,159
doherty

820
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,559
who is an air and resource holder

821
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,679
the question is does this not overlap

822
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,559
with some of what rpki is supposed to

823
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,120
accomplish

824
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,240
there's a lot of truth to that

825
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,480
um the

826
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,440
component of a route object looks very

827
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,399
similar to aro in rpki

828
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,760
it's a prefix and an asn and this is

829
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,200
where you know i'm i'm in the rpki terms

830
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,919
i am making an attestation that this

831
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,600
prefix should be coming from csm

832
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,320
the main difference

833
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,640
between those two methods of

834
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,559
authenticating

835
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,960
a prefix is the the cryptographic chain

836
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,840
of

837
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,960
of events through uh through rpki where

838
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,039
those routes are validated um as being

839
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,240
true

840
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,679
the the rir says it's good and then gets

841
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,000
all the way to the organization who is

842
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,039
making decisions on on the roast you

843
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,640
know the rpi information that it gets

844
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,120
and does that comparison to bgp uh

845
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,279
that's not something that is available

846
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,640
to

847
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,240
a user of the ir there is no like check

848
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,600
and balance

849
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,279
that is available in our yeah

850
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,760
all right thanks next

851
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,640
remote question this is from mattpack

852
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,359
unaffiliated

853
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,000
and matthew says brad couldn't a similar

854
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,960
objective be accomplished excuse me by

855
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,839
putting expiration entries on records

856
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,679
requiring them to be revalidated

857
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,159
periodically and expiring records that

858
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,639
aren't periodically refreshed rather

859
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,480
than throwing the entire baby out with

860
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
the bathwater we do the same thing with

861
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,719
poc records that must be periodically

862
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,960
revalidated why not do the same thing

863
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,839
with the irr data

864
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,399
that's a good question um

865
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,839
in reference to

866
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,040
poc data certainly there is a

867
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,239
a

868
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,960
very tight linkage between you know an

869
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,918
an organization who's paying that you

870
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,839
know those fees to be

871
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,960
um uh you know part of the the aaron

872
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,000
community

873
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,480
to get those resources but

874
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,960
if those organizations by themselves

875
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,839
don't

876
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,760
either check the information that they

877
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,839
have already put in

878
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,760
or

879
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
you know listen to and pay attention to

880
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,079
the messaging that's that's put out

881
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,079
our

882
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,440
method or if we follow the method to say

883
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,160
hey let's kick off a refresh of this

884
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,200
information and it needs to be either

885
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,440
checked by by the people who put it in

886
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,320
as being true or it's no longer useful

887
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,920
go ahead and take it out i mean that's

888
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,079
something that's available to those

889
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,079
those points of contact today

890
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,079
and they're not doing it so

891
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,240
the question is if aaron were to

892
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,480
automatically pull those out

893
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,680
would that not be akin to

894
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,320
aaron tearing rose out

895
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
it's it's not

896
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,160
something that we

897
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,599
would would

898
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,800
i personally would ever look into doing

899
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,079
and the development that would be

900
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,000
associated with doing that is is not um

901
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,520
it's not desirable because we're trying

902
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,839
to get rid of it anyway we don't want to

903
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:07,760
try to maintain what we're trying to get

904
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,720
rid of so um

905
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,280
no

906
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,640
okay thanks uh next question is from uh

907
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,800
i hope i pronounced this right gus

908
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,599
schlichman who is with a private owned

909
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,920
company in the financial sector

910
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,720
and the question is

911
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,760
um

912
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,680
could you please summarize what the

913
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,359
steps are to migrate to irr auth what's

914
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,920
the process

915
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,599
[Music]

916
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,560
the the easiest answer that i could give

917
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,040
someone who has questions like that

918
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,920
would be

919
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,760
reach out to our help desk because there

920
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,520
are arguably a number of people that

921
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,520
want to do that

922
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,480
the

923
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,720
the process would be

924
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,040
find your records that are in the

925
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,560
non-off and then

926
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,079
you need to understand what were the

927
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,560
circumstances that got it there was it

928
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,359
uh

929
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,200
not tied to

930
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,160
an existing uh

931
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,640
org id or maybe those resources used to

932
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,680
be with an

933
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,079
older or there's been an acquisition of

934
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,920
of address space and i know this may not

935
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,960
be your your particular case but

936
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,800
the the only way that it can be done is

937
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,880
identify what your non-auth record is

938
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,359
before you can clearly state how to how

939
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,640
to get it fixed

940
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,760
[Music]

941
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,880
okay

942
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,839
thank you

943
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,400
the next question is from tony tober

944
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,560
with comcast

945
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,040
could aaron make route or route 6

946
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,839
objects for things that in erin's hosted

947
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,839
rpki

948
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,599
that would that could simplify some

949
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,480
things

950
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,200
so

951
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,720
there are development efforts in flow at

952
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,160
aaron right now

953
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,079
and and tony that is one thing that we

954
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,040
are looking into the the

955
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,320
tighter linkage between the two uh you

956
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,160
know routing security options of ir and

957
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,720
rpki uh certainly there there's

958
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,280
understanding and and probably

959
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,599
easy acceptance to say i'm creating a

960
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,400
roa please create an ir record and you

961
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,320
know all the valid valid information

962
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,880
that goes into the validated irr um

963
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,960
certainly the flip side of it is i've

964
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,240
created an irr object um create a rowa

965
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,640
well there's many number of of

966
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,560
uh roadblocks to doing that organization

967
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,960
needs to already be signed up and

968
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,640
running rpki to be able to do something

969
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,720
like that but um to answer your question

970
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,040
tony yes we're we're looking into

971
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,119
uh doing things like that and if you

972
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,280
have any any asks you know please reach

973
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,400
out

974
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,800
all right thanks uh one last question

975
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,880
looks like from the remote queue this is

976
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,720
from michael doherty again

977
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,119
will aaron remove or de-allocate

978
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,760
non-validated or non-responsive holder

979
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,040
resources

980
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,160
how will prefix asn et cetera how will

981
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,480
that be enforced or implemented

982
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,880
um simple answer is no we're not going

983
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,720
to use this to revoke resources

984
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,580
no no

985
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,320
[Music]

986

987
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,560
questions so
