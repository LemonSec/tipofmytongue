[Music]

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:06,560
well i'd like to do something a little

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,280
bit different this time um

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,280
if i'm talking about something and you

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,200
want to address it this is community

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,040
meeting this is about connecting with

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,039
the nano community this is about trying

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,960
to get your feedback let you understand

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,880
what's going on in the organization and

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,199
help get some input that help us the

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,760
myself and the board and staff to better

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,519
serve the needs of the community so at

13
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:28,720
any point if you feel like there's

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,160
something that you really want to get up

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,760
to the mic and say hey edward i want to

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,760
talk about that point for a moment

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,680
feel free to step up mike interrupt me

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,520
it's okay i won't get lost i know what

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,200
i'm talking about so i'm i'm feeling

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,399
good

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,399
so one more thing before two more things

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,039
before i start um one is to let you know

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,559
if you're wanting to interact with the

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,879
people online in chat if you go to the

25
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,719
nanak webpage and you're in the meeting

26
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,920
pages

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,239
if you follow the links along the bottom

28
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,920
side of the event pages you'll see one

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,320
at the very bottom that says chat only

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,239
so you can click on that it'll open up a

31
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,920
chat window open only so you can

32
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,520
interact directly with people online if

33
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,879
you choose

34
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,479
and then the other thing is

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,840
we're doing a little experiment at this

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,880
meeting

37
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,119
and that was kind of a little pet geeky

38
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,479
project of mine

39
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,680
we are streaming this live in addition

40
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,600
to the typical live stream we're also

41
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,960
streaming this in 360. so there is a 360

42
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,119
degree crammer hanging up above on those

43
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,040
lights and you can actually go in and

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,680
actually see the room in 360 pan around

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,320
so just above that link where it says

46
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,720
chat only there's a link that says 360

47
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,479
view beta

48
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,320
we've disabled the sound right now and

49
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,560
the reason being is that thing has a mic

50
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,479
on it we didn't pump sound directly into

51
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,200
it and so it's picking up any music or

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,759
sound was playing and youtube will cut

53
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,079
the stream like that if it hears

54
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,240
copyrighted material going through

55
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,040
so

56
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,880
again just fun things we're trying to do

57
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,840
to try to give people a better

58
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,960
experience

59
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,880
because if you're experiencing this

60
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,960
meeting um remotely it's kind of hard to

61
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,439
feel what is the nav conference like so

62
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,680
that 360 camera is a way to for people

63
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,920
to be able to if you're remote to you

64
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,639
know click in to around see what an anna

65
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,479
conference looks like and it is a live

66
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,480
stream as well as our

67
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,160
our standard livestream is

68
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,280
okay

69
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,560
that said let me kind of move forward

70
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
so the first thing i want to talk about

71
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,000
is the impact of covet 19 on the

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,920
organization

73
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,720
so

74
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,720
it was a challenging time period um it

75
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,440
was unexpected and it required

76
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
board staff and myself to kind of

77
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,000
quickly adapt and pivot

78
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,440
one of the things that happened is we

79
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,360
had remote tools that were kind of on

80
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,120
the horizon things that we wanted to

81
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,200
work on that we had to shift around

82
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,560
suddenly things that were distant

83
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,800
priorities became immediate priorities

84
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,000
and then certain things that were

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,760
immediate priorities kind of got shifted

86
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,599
to the back burner for example the

87
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,280
appointment tool was the thing that was

88
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,879
next up in our agenda things that we

89
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,560
were developing but if you're not doing

90
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,080
face-to-face meetings the appointment

91
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,000
tool kind of isn't as critical as having

92
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,280
a virtual platform so we're going to be

93
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,680
uh ramping up on the virtual

94
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,280
sorry on the appointment tool coming up

95
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,560
next so i'll talk about that a little

96
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,440
further

97
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,959
through this deck but again it's very

98
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,640
important that we have that and it's

99
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,040
again it's on our development agenda

100
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,319
um it also exposed a weakness within our

101
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,360
current revenue model and strengths and

102
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,519
weaknesses are kind of you know

103
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,760
converse to one another our strength has

104
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,239
been our sponsorship community

105
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,040
our

106
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,120
members and our community has been great

107
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,200
about supporting the organization

108
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,799
however sponsorship is based upon an roi

109
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,400
for the sponsors

110
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,080
they love nano because they get a chance

111
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,000
to get in front of network engineers and

112
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,640
industry professionals and to be able to

113
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,159
you know promote their products and

114
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,440
services

115
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,799
if they don't have that opportunity it's

116
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,319
kind of a hard sell to their

117
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,360
organization so it exposed that and as

118
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
um dave siegel had mentioned in speech

119
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,799
one of the things that i'm trying to do

120
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,200
as executive director is to look for new

121
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,439
models of revenue for the organization

122
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,200
so that no matter what happens within

123
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,120
nano we'll be able to weather any storm

124
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,360
that comes our way

125
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,720
one two things that were really

126
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
extremely important to us getting these

127
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,959
past these past 21 months was one the

128
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,920
ppp loans they were great

129
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,599
they have been

130
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,918
i think we received all totaled maybe

131
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:22,639
250 plus close to 260 000

132
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,400
in revenue they came from these ppp

133
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,199
loans and both loans were forgiven so

134
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,120
that was revenue that came in for nanag

135
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,880
that helped support us during this time

136
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,280
and kept us afloat um the second is the

137
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,520
financial reserves that previous boards

138
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,680
have put together and and and saved for

139
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,199
that rainy day and they have been

140
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,919
extremely helpful now that said we've

141
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,560
been fortunate enough that it's only i

142
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
think maybe

143
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,800
oh

144
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,960
three weeks ago that we actually

145
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,600
withdrew our first bit from our

146
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,080
strategic reserves so we've been able to

147
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,479
manage the organization with ppp loans

148
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,639
being frugal to get us to this point but

149
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,320
we are now going to have to step into

150
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
those reserves and we'll talk about that

151
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,680
more in the in the members meeting

152
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,479
education and mentorship committee

153
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,000
updates

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,840
so um the board

155
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
this time well i guess a little bit

156
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,360
close to this time last year kind of

157
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,840
engaged and put together these the

158
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
mentorship and education committees and

159
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
to me these are going to be cornerstones

160
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,080
as we start to build outreach kind of

161
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,440
going forward

162
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,160
so

163
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
the mentorship committee in this media

164
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,840
steps that they've going to be putting

165
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,680
together is we're going to be developing

166
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,479
a training program to assure that

167
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,600
quality engagement between mentors and

168
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,759
and mentees um

169
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,440
and we're building this as an in an

170
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,600
online uh online learning through a

171
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,520
learning management system in addition

172
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,039
we're gonna be taking the nano code of

173
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,759
conduct and also converting it into an

174
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,800
online um course the reason being is we

175
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,039
don't just want someone to read through

176
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,560
the code of conduct and say oh yeah i

177
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,880
read it click check the box we want to

178
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,400
make sure that they clearly understand

179
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
the principles behind it so that when

180
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,639
they are serving our committee community

181
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,800
and when they're out

182
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,880
working with mentees to assure that they

183
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,440
understand the principles that nano

184
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,960
upholds and will pass those on and use

185
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,479
them appropriately when they're engaging

186
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,720
with mentees

187
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,039
newcomers is now led by the mentorship

188
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,960
committee so some of you may have been

189
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,280
in the room uh vincent came up and he

190
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,160
get our first kind of spiel of uh what

191
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,479
we're doing for uh uh the newcomers

192
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,000
coming forward uh currently on average

193
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,520
at a nano conference this being an

194
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,639
exception

195
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,800
um usually one third of the people who

196
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,560
come to a nano conference have never

197
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,479
been to a nanak before

198
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,000
and the question is

199
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,759
how are we engaging them how are we

200
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,199
interacting with these with these

201
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,840
individuals so the mentorship committee

202
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,319
has developed this um this slide deck

203
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,800
that goes over a history of what nanog

204
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,360
uh where we've been who we are what we

205
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
stand for the programs that we offer and

206
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,960
then also give them a preview of the

207
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
program itself so that people can get

208
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,039
really an understanding of what nanog is

209
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,319
and then when we start to move forward

210
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,080
we're engaging with mentorship we're

211
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,400
engaging with education the whole the

212
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,280
hope is that we can get better retention

213
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,319
for our organization

214
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,039
if you have a desire to be a mentor go

215
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,759
to our website there across the top menu

216
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,919
bar there's a button called feedback

217
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,599
click on that

218
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,199
send me a message and say hey i'm

219
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,120
interested in becoming a mentor for

220
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,960
nanog and we'll

221
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,199
put you through our training program and

222
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,440
hopefully in austin we'll have some

223
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,919
mentees who are wanting to connect and

224
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,360
expand their careers and maybe you can

225
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,960
be one of these people that helped them

226
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,280
move forward

227
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,599
and this program will again mention will

228
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,680
begin in austin

229
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,800
uh the education program so um an rfp

230
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,720
for the uh course development will be

231
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,039
released this week uh there are five

232
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,560
courses that we want to put in the

233
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,800
hopper for development right away there

234
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,720
are fundamentals of finance for network

235
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,919
engineers

236
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,479
routing fundamentals ipv6 and its

237
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,280
current future role in networking

238
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,919
networking automation and bgp so we

239
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,000
tried to do a mix of things that would

240
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
be interesting to kind of people

241
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,919
mid-career people and also things that

242
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,919
would be interesting for students who've

243
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,000
never had exposure to the environment as

244
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,039
well

245
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,879
all courses will be developed for

246
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,639
in-person

247
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,639
classes and also for we'll have an

248
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,520
online component as well so we can serve

249
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,639
both people

250
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,360
at meetings and then also people who um

251
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,559
connect to the organization online and

252
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,279
for the for the uh for students who come

253
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,880
in who are part of our our uh

254
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,959
nano college immersion program these

255
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,600
classes will be free for them as well so

256
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,440
again trying to get people engaged and

257
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,560
as educated as much as possible um

258
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,959
depending on the rfp responses uh these

259
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,240
classes will begin either in nanog 84 or

260
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,480
nano 85 we're not clear what the

261
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,000
development cycle will be to make those

262
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,920
happen

263
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,560
development updates um i'll

264
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,640
pop in and talk about some of the things

265
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,959
we've done in

266
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:11,519
2021

267
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,760
so we developed uh that we released in

268
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,920
down aughty one a new event management

269
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,200
system

270
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,040
we developed a system to allow us to

271
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,760
have various types of events and to be

272
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,680
able to make them easily easy and

273
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,760
accessible

274
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,480
one thing we talked about at in nanog-80

275
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,360
i mean

276
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,920
yes the board had voted to make these

277
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,279
tools available to other organizations

278
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,440
and specifically

279
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,000
nogs within our region so that they can

280
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,440
kind of leverage some of the tools that

281
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,200
we have and so hopefully we'll get some

282
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,880
engagement is there

283
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,279
in analog 82 we released our new

284
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,839
registration system that was was trimmed

285
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,080
down and focused on virtual events and

286
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,760
then at this meeting we've expanded it

287
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,720
to handle both virtual uh in-person

288
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,640
webinars etc

289
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,560
we're still kind of going through a

290
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
growth cycle in that we had been using

291
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
sievent for years and we've made the

292
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,360
ship to our own internal platform one of

293
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,040
the desire was there was to one to make

294
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,200
a better experience for our community to

295
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,640
make sure that we had a system that

296
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,320
worked for us not one that we're trying

297
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,720
to shoehorn in it was a one size fits

298
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,519
all

299
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,760
the other thing is that we we care about

300
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
your data and we want that data not to

301
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,600
be shared with anyone we don't share

302
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,920
your data with sponsors with other

303
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,680
members and we want to make sure that

304
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,399
your information is safe and protected

305
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,079
and you'll continue to see other

306
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,839
additions and

307
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,360
bug fixes and things like that will be

308
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,680
going along as we kind of build out some

309
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
of the things that we're able to do

310
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,320
with an organization and in december

311
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,120
2021 this year we're going to start the

312
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,680
development of the appointment tool

313
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,920
the goal is by the time we reach to

314
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,240
nanog84

315
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,640
i cannot promise that we'll have a a

316
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,160
completely functional appointment tool

317
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,079
but hopefully the goal is to have a

318
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,279
alpha or a beta that you can take and

319
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,040
kind of get a chance to to play with

320
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,279
that

321
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,640
future development projects um

322
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,160
8984 we're going to release and go back

323
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,320
to our on-demand our on-demand badge

324
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,000
printing that we had used in in previous

325
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,680
analogs again this is going to be an

326
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,079
in-house system that will be developed

327
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,560
and integrated into our website

328
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,560
and we're also going to

329
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,959
expand the features in your profile

330
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,519
tools so for example right now if you

331
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,040
wanted to go through and make some

332
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,120
adjustments to your profile tool you can

333
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,560
if you go there you're going to see the

334
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,880
previous invoices that you've had or

335
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,720
you'll be able to kind of manage certain

336
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,399
things in your registration we're going

337
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,320
to be expanding that even further with

338
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,600
some of the things that you'll be able

339
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,240
to do the goal to do the goal is to give

340
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
you our community as much power and

341
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,320
control over your information as

342
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,440
possible

343
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,839
um in

344
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,360
nanog85 we're hoping to have an open

345
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,920
beta of a appointment tool like i said

346
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,720
this could be maybe nana 84 we have a

347
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,880
hybrid i can't say but definitely an

348
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,760
analog 85 will have a open beta for the

349
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,200
new appointment tool

350
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,959
plus again additional improvements to

351
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,160
the profile management uh nanog86 will

352
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,920
have a completed

353
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,240
tool with direct messaging via the

354
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
virtual chat system

355
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,800
um a request has been for you'll be able

356
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,560
to direct message people in our chat

357
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,079
system

358
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,839
but it's also tied to the appointment

359
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,760
tool because the question you have to

360
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,880
ask when you register is one do you want

361
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,720
someone to be able to make an

362
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,800
appointment with you two do you want

363
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,320
someone to be able to communicate with

364
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,240
you directly through chat so these

365
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,600
things are kind of connected so those

366
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,560
things will kind of roll in and happen

367
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,518
simultaneously

368
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,480
i can i sock mousse so we've had a long

369
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,839
standing mou with aaron aaron has been

370
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,519
a critical partner in a lot of things

371
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,360
that we do as this organization and

372
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,120
we've greatly appreciate that

373
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,040
relationship and we hope as things go

374
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,440
forward that continue to expand those

375
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,839
collaborations with other organizations

376
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,200
within our ecosystem which has led to a

377
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,800
memorandum of understanding with both

378
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,680
icann and isoc so the goal is simple we

379
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,839
want to combine our areas of expertise

380
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,920
to improve outreach efforts within north

381
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,079
america within the area that is nanox

382
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,639
kind of territory um and this will work

383
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,120
in time in tandem with our current um

384
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,560
outreach partners there are current

385
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
sponsors who support us in this area

386
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,920
it's not that they're going away it's

387
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,600
just that we're we know that to

388
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,440
accomplish the things that we'd like to

389
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,839
do it's going to require as much support

390
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,160
energy and help as possible and i'm

391
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,959
hoping that as we roll into 2022

392
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,720
things start opening up for travel

393
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,880
people start coming to events

394
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,279
i want to focus on trying to do more

395
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,880
outreach

396
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,040
to be more people engaged and involved

397
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,120
in the nano community

398
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
so the the outreach areas that we're

399
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,800
going to focus on is

400
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,639
student engagement

401
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,480
diversity and inclusion within our

402
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,920
environment because we all share the

403
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,040
same problems whether it's icann isoc

404
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,440
nanog aaron we're all in the same boat

405
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,839
in this so pooling our efforts allow us

406
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,920
to be able to do more

407
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
underserved communities

408
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,519
underserved communities indigenous

409
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,320
populations underserved communities in

410
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,920
the the north american part of the

411
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,399
caribbean and even underserved i mean

412
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,800
there are rural parts in america that

413
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,120
are very very underserved and what can

414
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,920
we do as an organization to maybe not

415
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,680
necessarily bring infrastructure in but

416
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,760
maybe we can bring educational

417
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,440
opportunities maybe there's programs

418
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,639
that we can get to have them come to

419
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,600
nana

420
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,920
meetings where they can get in contact

421
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,360
with yourselves be part of mentorship

422
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,519
program take educational opportunities

423
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,360
to help them grow as individuals

424
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,120
and also professional development in

425
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,160
smaller communities within north america

426
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,160
so that said i'm going to turn things

427
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,120
over to aggie and he will

428
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,120
carry him from there

429
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,560
oh unless you guys have any questions

430
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,000
for me right now we're going to have a q

431
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,360
a at the end but yes go ahead there's a

432
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,600
question

433
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,560
edward we had one question from online

434
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,040
and it was from brian johnson he asked

435
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,440
for the education program who will own

436
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,760
the courseware the net the course will

437
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,440
be owned by nanak

438
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,000
that is the criteria

439
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,360
yes avi oh that's tall there we go

440
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,199
um two questions

441
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,759
uh any idea about roughly how much for

442
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,480
the non-students you know college folks

443
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,560
the idea would be to charge

444
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,600
uh for the for the non-students we're in

445
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,680
we're evaluating that process we haven't

446
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,959
made that determinate termination um i

447
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,959
think it as we roll through i'm sure

448
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,160
we'll probably do some focus group

449
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,480
testing to see what kind of a sweet spot

450
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,279
for uh charging i mean

451
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,440
we're a non-profit so

452
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
we're not trying to get rich off online

453
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,759
or in-person education we want to be

454
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,320
able to if possible have it pay for

455
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,680
itself

456
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,399
so

457
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,839
we're going to try to be as flexible as

458
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,639
we can in that so another issue oh sorry

459
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,959
please yeah another issue that we've had

460
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,320
um

461
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,639
when working actually with dni trainers

462
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,600
is

463
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,480
um

464
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,639
getting leave behind in the collateral

465
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,240
right so the question is is the value in

466
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,320
the way it's presented in the q a or the

467
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,000
actual curriculum

468
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,560
um you know if you're charging for it is

469
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,240
the curriculum going to become available

470
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,639
or is that you know any idea about how

471
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,560
that'll work

472
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,800
it's a very good question and right now

473
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
i'll be honest i don't have an exact

474
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,560
answer for that but thank you for that

475
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,240
because that's something as being part

476
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,680
of the education and mentorship

477
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,519
community uh committees i will bring

478
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,040
that back in because it's good it's a

479
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,199
good question cool yeah we had no idea

480
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:50,639
we were going to get caught by this kind

481
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,959
of thing either so yeah yeah exactly

482

uh michael costello with netflix for the

485
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,160
educational mission there was an rfp

486
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,640
that was mentioned so for those here who

487
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,880
are in attendance either in the room or

488
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,959
online if they want to participate in

489
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,640
the rfp how do they get involved so we

490
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,359
will

491
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,119
when the rfp goes out we're going to

492
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,679
have the full content of the rsp on a

493
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,559
web page on our website it will go out

494
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,439
as part of the rfp we're also going to

495
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,359
circulate it on social media and we'll

496
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,439
also put it out in nanak announce so

497
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,960

498
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,039
nanog should be able to know that the

499

steve all right arista uh just a

503
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,600
question about the um

504
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,840
newcomers you mentioned about 30 percent

505
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,240
of the newcomers or 30 of the attendees

506
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,360
rather

507
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,520
in pre-covet

508
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,919
sessions were newcomers yes

509
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,760
do we have any idea

510
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,039
we're obviously not growing at 30

511
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,000
percent

512
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,600
per meeting

513
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,760
any idea why they're not coming back or

514
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,480
is there any form of outreach or

515
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,080
research we're doing to to figure out

516
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,600
what the you know gating factors are

517
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,120
there

518
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,840
good questions um i will confess we've

519
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,080
not done a good job of measuring that

520
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,919
and follow through on that um you don't

521
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,200
have to leave yet because i want to i

522
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
wanted to ask i want to ask you a

523
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,679
question on that so in part of our um

524
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,120
the mentorship committee that's

525
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,240
something that we'll we're going to

526
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,200
looking at at tackling um because we we

527
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,679
do want to be able to track those things

528
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,160
and we're hopefully to improve retention

529
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,559
so if you have any ideas in that area

530
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,520

538
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,440
committee updates i would like to take a

539
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,520
moment to recognize people

540
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,600
on the broken committee if you're in the

541
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
room in person

542
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,120
please stand up

543
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,600

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,320
virtual attendance please say hi

545
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,160
again thank you for supporting nanog for

546
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,310
being a volunteer

547
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:16,629
[Applause]

548
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,000
first i must say that there is a lot

549
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
that happens behind the scene to prepare

550
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,679
and build the nano program

551
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,240
introducing the content reviewer

552
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
row is an example of how the nano

553
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,000
program committee continues to evolve in

554
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,760
a positive way

555
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,000
we created this new role to help offload

556
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,360
work from the program committee

557
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,559
secretary

558
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,160
the content reviewer partners with the

559
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,559
shepherd to support the submitter

560
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,080
ensures the presentation follows

561
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,080
standards for recording live

562
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,679
presentation

563
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,200
in addition the content reviewer

564
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,720
approves the final slides to be to be

565
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,320
published on the program and helps

566
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,679
prepare speaker introductions

567
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,440
thematic programming

568
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,039
i don't know if you have noticed how the

569
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,520
nano program has been structured for

570
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,080
some time now

571
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,000
as a program committee we did our best

572
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,240
to build a program having relation to

573
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,120
particular subjects for example you see

574
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,559
a lot of v6 content grouped on wednesday

575
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,919
morning also

576
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,799
content around government and policies

577
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,960
grouped on tuesday morning

578
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,600
earlier acceptance and this is something

579
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,760
that's really helped

580
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,960
for those of you that have recently

581
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,320
submitted talks

582
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,400
you probably noticed that the program

583
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,799
committee is more responsive to with

584
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,120
reviews feedback and approvals for

585
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,480
content to be added to the program

586
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,400
within the nano program committee we

587
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,240
agreed that it made sense to engage in

588
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,520
reviews and voting as early as possible

589
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,280
so that we're better prepared to build

590
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,400
an outstanding program

591
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,559
it truly pays off to be able to publish

592
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,480
the program on time so that our

593
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,080
community

594
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,799
can be informed on what to expect

595
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,320
in an anarch meeting coming up

596
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,400
related to scripts

597
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,840
scripts for the people in the program

598
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,240
committee there are moderating to how

599
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,720
the conference are now

600
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,400
published prior to the meeting so that

601
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,120
we don't miss anything

602
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,600
important

603
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,240
call for presentations

604
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,640
rolling call for presentations are now

605
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,520
available for the next three conferences

606
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,200
and we have some ideas to get you

607
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,880
started

608
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,360
uh carriers are planning to shut down

609
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,840
3g in 2022

610
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,240
please send us your 5g talks for nanok84

611
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,159
another good idea is

612
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,760
our event coming up is the 10th

613
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,880
anniversary of world ipv6 day

614
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,000
on june

615
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,400
6th of next year this is the first day

616
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,960

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,200
in montreal quebec

618
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,919
and finally we are looking for ideas of

619
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,360
what could be

620
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,880
a good theme for

621
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,280
the october next year

622
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,918
event meeting in hollywood california

623
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,360
we understand

624
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,960
that what really makes the meeting a

625
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,760
success is the quality of the program

626
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,640
that we put together for a community

627
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,120

the audience to get some live feedback

671

still going to happen but i'd like you

673
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,440
guys to be able to give being some

674
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,039
live feedback

675
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,039
from some of the things that just a few

676
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,320
questions they have answered now if

677
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
you're interested in you can go to this

678
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,840
url poll

679
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,240
ev.com or you can text

680
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,720
2233 once to join or you can download

681
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,360
their their app so

682
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,320
the first question that i have is

683
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,640
are you interested in becoming a mentor

684
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,559
give people a chance to kind of uh

685
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,279
respond on that one

686
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,039
it doesn't let you do

687
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,120
multiple pulls simultaneously so i have

688
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,600
to let one kind of give a few minutes to

689
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
to load up and then we'll turn around

690
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,600
and jump into the next question

691
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
any feedback that you guys can give us

692
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,720
at all um helps um the one thing that i

693
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,440
found in working with the nano community

694
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,760
and at first it was a bit challenging is

695
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,320
that you would either hear some

696
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,440
complaints

697
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,279
or you'll hear nothing

698
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,200
and so it came to if you're not hearing

699
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,559
anything that means you're doing a good

700
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,600
job but if you can give us some feedback

701
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,400
beyond that it really does help and i

702
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,760
will tell you this

703
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,440
any feedback that comes through this

704
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,640
organization i read it um i'm sure some

705
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,159
of you know i have

706
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,679
they'll you've seen communication like

707
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:50,960
oh there's a problem with the website or

708
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,039
i can't find this you know if it if i

709
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,960
see it for anyone else i will personally

710
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,799
respond so

711
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,400
your information feedback and

712
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,760
communication is crucial to the

713
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,400
organization

714
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,760
all right give it another

715
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,440
10

716
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,360
15 seconds

717
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,520
and then we will um

718
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,720
i guess i should

719
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,640
yeah because there's people online

720
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,799
they're delayed 30 seconds of seeing

721
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,960
this

722
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,799
okay

723
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,720
let me switch to the next slide

724
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,880
i'll activate

725
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,480
and switch

726
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,520
so

727
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,000
will your company allow corporate travel

728
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,320
in

729
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,960
2022

730
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,840
i know during 2021 a lot of uh

731
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,080
organizations kind of shut down all

732
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,559
travel so um

733
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,840
will it happen in 2022

734
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,080
this just helps us to plan and prepare

735
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,840
for upcoming events

736
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,520
okay

737
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,600
since people are engaged those a

738
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,120
response will come a little faster

739
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,720
and while this is happening if you guys

740
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,320
have any other questions for me you can

741
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,960
jump up to the

742
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,120
if mic can't answer it i'll say i don't

743
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,360
know

744
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,080
but in general i'm not too shy

745
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,840
okay so we'll go on to our next question

746
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,399
are you plan how are you planning to are

747
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,720
you planning to attend nanag in 84 and

748
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,200
if so how

749
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,320
yes no

750
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,840
virtually undecided

751
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,080
i hope as many of you guys can come

752
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,399
austin's a fun city and

753
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,240
it'll be great to just again continue to

754
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,720
connect with the community

755
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,039
as i mentioned the online audience is a

756
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,320
little bit delayed so we'll give it a

757
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,840
few seconds for that

758
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,880
okay so i'll let that one kind of roll a

759
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,520
second and i'll um it'll still collect

760
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,840
data but i'll move on to the to the next

761
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,200
slide

762
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,240
so we're rolling to q a are there any

763
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
questions that you guys have unrelated

764
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,240
to anything we've talked about but

765
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,240
related to nano that you want to discuss

766
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,760
will there be bacon

767
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,120
all right

768
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,279
you have a question chris

769
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,840
come on down

770
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,480
all right chris mcfield twitter

771
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,279
you mentioned that this meeting is

772
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,240
not profitable and that's understandable

773
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,200
yeah um

774
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,279
in your opinion how

775
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,320
like let's say next meeting is also too

776
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,559
small a small meeting and is also not

777
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,679
profitable

778
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,159
um how many meetings do you think we

779
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:25,919
could handle before we'd have to make a

780
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,480
fundamental change

781
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,799
in the meeting in order to

782
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,559
make sure it breaks even again well i

783
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:35,200
think that question really comes down to

784
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,760
how much we're not breaking even i mean

785
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,799
if it were

786
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,640
we're we're not breaking even let's say

787
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,919
it's you know

788
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,919
30 40 50 000

789
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,240
um we could probably do it for a little

790
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,880
while but i'm sure for the and i'm

791
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,640
speaking for myself but i'm also being

792
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,360
the board is that if it happens you know

793
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,799
let's say a couple of meetings in a row

794
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,159
and it doesn't seem like it's showing

795
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,159
anything around i think we we would

796
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,520
definitely take steps to see what we

797
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,919
could do as an organization

798
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,240
to not let's just burn through cash i

799
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,720
mean we as the board and which i'm on we

800
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,480
have a fiduciary responsibility to make

801
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,120
sure that nanog is a is a financially

802
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,919
solvent organization so uh we take that

803
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,279
very seriously

804
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,799
if you were on some of the board calls

805
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,960
when we were deliberating all of this

806
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,159
we

807
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,159
i mean we just go in

808
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,559
ad nauseum because the board loves the

809
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,640
community they love the organization and

810
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,399
they want it to survive

811
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,799
so at the same time

812
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,880
i mean nanook is about the connection

813
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,080
with people

814
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,080
and when you don't have that it changes

815
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,799
the whole dynamic of the organization so

816
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,799
we want to meet we want to connect but

817
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,559
we also want to make sure that nanak

818
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,159
doesn't disappear as well

819
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,480
thanks

820
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,200
any other questions

821
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,399
all right thank you all for your time

822
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:59,339
