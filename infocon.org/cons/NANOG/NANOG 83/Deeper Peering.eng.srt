[Music]

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,440
without further ado i would like to

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,720
welcome

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,679
guy tall

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,839
who will be presenting deeper hearing

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,640
is a senior director

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,400
product manager

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,039
guy is a senior product

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,119
management at

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,680
lumen formerly centurylink

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,840
this is guy's fourth time presenting at

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,760
nanag

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,760
guy's first target the talk at nanog was

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,120
a foray into mpls at nanog39 in 2007

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,680
at toronto canada did i say that right

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,520
all right cool

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,320
welcome back guy we are very happy to

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,320
have you presenting today

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,680
thank you mike yep

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,680
[Applause]

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,600
boy i guess i'd just like to pick the

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,359
cold weather climates to present in i

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,160
guess

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,039
um

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,960
well thank you it's good to see as many

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,320
faces in the crowd as we have here

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,040
my talk is called deeper peering

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,200
but really what it comes down to this is

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,799
more of a talk about

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,600
you know measurement inertia

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,119
and adaptation

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,640
so wait a minute wait a minute i know

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,479
like a bunch of you thinking wait no

34
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,759
this is supposed to be about peering or

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,000
deep hearing or something right well

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,439
it's about everything it's about all

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,839
those things

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,280
so i i think at a gut level everyone

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,040
sort of knows that

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,280
it makes more sense to have deeper

41
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,280
interconnection with everybody you want

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,200
your source and your destination to be

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
as close as possible

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,360
you know why why is that well you know

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,799
over the last

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,799
you know 20 30 years that we've been or

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,640
that i've been doing this anyway

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,960
you know we've seen the rise of

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,240
converged services onto the ip core so

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,680
vpn voip you know cdn

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,200
gaming

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,719
all these things that

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,000
are bandwidth intensive and need low

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,439
latency to

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,799
you know perform the way that the

56
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,800
application owner wants

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,920
well where are we going next we we have

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,959
you know more video more cdn

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,879
we're going to see ar vr sd-wan sassy

60
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,560
edge services

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,959
all relying on lower

62
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,879
latency

63
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,200
so i think at a fundamental level we

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,080
sort of know that it makes sense to

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,800
connect in more than just the the nine

66
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,720
you know sort of tier one

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,200
interconnection markets in the u.s

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,879
and i'll preface this by saying this is

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,040
a u.s centric

70
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,160
slide deck

71
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,080
i have a similar one made for europe

72
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,760
i'll give you the punch line from that

73
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,680
at the end of this one

74
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,160
but this is going to focus on us

75
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,239
so not only do you get better

76
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,760
performance but

77
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,760
you'll also be able to get better cost

78
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,560
economics a lot of the access circuits

79
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,319
coming in

80
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,280
now

81
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,440
actually cost more than the ip component

82
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,040
of the service so

83
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,519
you know if you could buy a circuit in

84
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,519
minneapolis here instead of having to

85
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,360
haul down to chicago

86
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,360
you know it's better for

87
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,440
you as the customer

88
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,319
you'll if there's peering to support it

89
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,159
so that the traffic you know stays local

90
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,000
so this is all kind of fundamentally

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,599
made sense but

92
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,519
you know you have to measure

93
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,720
to

94
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,879
know if it actually

95
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,280
bears fruition you know there's an adage

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,040
that if what you don't

97
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,440
measure you can't manage so

98
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,120
so this is the first part

99
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,400
um

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
you know here's some initial thoughts i

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
had about

102
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,280
why aren't we already doing this since

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,959
it kind of fundamentally makes sense

104
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,640
so

105
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,400
i think one of the biggest

106
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,439
hurdles are that there's architecture

107
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,680
that everybody built their networks

108
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,480
you know twenty ten five years ago

109
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,000
and didn't incorporate the ability to

110
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,519
have these deeper interconnections with

111
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,200
each other

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,080
so

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,720
you know either from a pe management

114
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,959
perspective there's networks out there

115
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,639
that still have customers on separate

116
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,320
routers than peers

117
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,600
you know you have to update route

118
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
reflection dns

119
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,600
it's a lot more complicated than just

120
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,360
turning up a circuit between two

121
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,199
networks

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,800
the capacity planning starts to become

123
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,720
more onerous

124
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,800
uh you know how if you if you turn up a

125
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,800
lot of capacity

126
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,720
uh to somebody in minneapolis and

127
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,840
chicago if chicago goes away you know

128
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,280
all of a sudden minneapolis does

129
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,680
minneapolis take up that slack does it

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,320
go to new york does it go somewhere else

131
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,720
so it gets a lot more complex as far as

132
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,479
capacity planning

133
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,440
and then

134
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,040
the inertia part

135
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,840
is that there's this

136
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,400
i guess

137
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,280
just

138
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,759
again inertia i guess of procurement

139
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,880
people

140
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,280
buying circuits you know from

141
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,280
you know whatever state they're in into

142
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,600
one of these markets because they know

143
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,880
that there's not a lot of

144
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,680
interconnection in that market so why

145
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,280
buy it local you can go to the bigger

146
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,240
market get a better selection of vendors

147
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,919
lower prices everything that that

148
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,759
entails

149
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,080
so fundamentally these are

150
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,759
kind of the biggest hurdles to to

151
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,919
overcome

152
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:30,960
but

153
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,600
you know this slide kind of uh

154
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,240
was the beginning of the journey for me

155
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,520
because what happened was we had an

156
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
implementation engineer telling me hey

157
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,320
we just turned up uh we got one t of

158
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,240
capacity with the with a single pier in

159
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,759
chicago

160
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,240
oh wow that's great is that a lot

161
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,520
yeah i think so i think they're our

162
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,800
biggest pier

163
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,919
well or who's number two i don't know

164
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,840
do we have a tea with anybody else in

165
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,680
some other market in the us

166
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,880
i don't know

167
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,759
okay

168
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,880
so time to start collecting some data

169
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,000
so

170
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,560
whoops

171
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,600
yeah

172
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,160
so what ended up happening here is that

173
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,520
you know chicago atlanta and dallas

174
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,319
like ballooned up to the top of the the

175
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,479
nine markets in the us

176
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,080
and with the exception of dc right here

177
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,120
which i think is sort of a

178
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,080
i don't know

179
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,840
phenomenon of the

180
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,440
northern virginia data center market

181
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,680
more than anything

182
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
there was really really heavy weight on

183
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,039
just those three

184
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,400
like inside the us markets

185
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,319
now the u.s

186
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,080
you know years and years ago used to be

187
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,319
a lot more central part of the internet

188
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,000
than it is today

189
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,680
the europeans would come and buy

190
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,000
capacity on the east coast

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,680
the latin americans would come by

192
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,440
capacity in miami

193
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,759
asia would come in by in seattle and

194
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,680
california

195
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,120
um

196
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,440
but we're starting to see that decrease

197
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,840
now

198
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,199
so what i would have expected

199
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,240
because you know they're keep they're

200
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,599
doing a better job of keeping their

201
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,880
traffic local

202
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,720
so what i would expected was that the

203
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,960
capacity should mirror

204
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,000
the u.s population a little bit closer

205
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,840
and we actually did see that

206
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,080
but so forty percent of of the on our

207
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,199
network

208
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,520
of the capacity was

209
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,960
in the u.s was

210
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
in the nine major markets

211
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,120
were chicago atlanta and dallas

212
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,319
and so that kind of did bear out

213
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,080
it was pretty consistent with what we

214
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,639
saw from a population perspective

215
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,120
about 40 of the us population all live

216
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,680
within those three markets

217
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,400
uh 24 out of the 50 states are

218
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,800
buying their circuits into those markets

219
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,520
so you know working at lumen i was had

220
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
access to a lot of data

221
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,919
we sell more than just ip

222
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,000
you know we have vpn voip

223
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,960
the whole gamut of services

224
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,199
so i was able to see the a side and the

225
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,080
z side of a lot of these circuits

226
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,599
and

227
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,879
you know pretty much what i was

228
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,240
expecting here

229
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,280
was that

230
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
you know you sort of have this gravity

231
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,599
well here around chicago

232
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,879
where 20 of the population of the us

233
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,479
you know is buying

234
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,440
um

235
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,240
either capacity directly into chicago

236
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,199
or you know somewhere nearby

237
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,880
but it would all have to go to chicago

238
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
to switch off net

239
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,559
we saw the same thing down here with

240
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,679
dallas

241
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,599
in the southwest and then the southeast

242
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,399
here

243
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,159
it's pretty much all atlanta

244
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,920
so

245
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,880
all right

246
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,160
so that was the

247
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,360
the idea and we had some data to support

248
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,200
you know what we were seeing actually in

249
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,399
the ground

250
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,640
and so it came time to say all right

251
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,720
what are we going to do about this

252
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,080
and

253
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,519
we've

254
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,440
already known like again we sort of

255
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,680
presupposed that the idea would be

256
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,959
the result of this is that we're going

257
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,880
to need to interconnect deeper and so

258
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,399
now it was

259
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,560
creating the methodology of how do we

260
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,120
pick those next slate of interconnection

261
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,920
markets in the u.s

262
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,720
so

263
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,480
the two biggest

264
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,720
rules or i guess the things that we

265
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,320
weighted the heaviest

266
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,519
were

267
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,680
the msa

268
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,080
msa population density

269
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,120
and to follow the fiber that's you know

270
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,440
tried and true you know where do you

271
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,040
interconnect

272
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,480
um we also looked at rtt to nearby tier

273
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,200
1 markets

274
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,560
where were people already

275
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,000
interconnecting because we don't want to

276
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,279
break that inertia of you know

277
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,240
where

278
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,839
you know there's already people

279
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,680
appearing

280
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
and and we've actually been a little bit

281
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,279
ahead of the curve here

282
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,200
where we've been talking to our peering

283
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,519
partner saying hey you know we see lots

284
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,360
of flows from

285
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,839
you know whatever south dakota to

286
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,200
wisconsin

287
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,360
and let's exchange that

288
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,399
in minneapolis instead of chicago but

289
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,760
um

290
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,120
you know we also looked at things like

291
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,480
gdp

292
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,040
uh that does make sense on a state level

293
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,360
in the european analysis it came a

294
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,040
little bit more to the forefront from a

295
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,040
country perspective

296
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,480
and then you know like number of data

297
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,240
centers number of asn's again that was

298
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,680
kind of more

299
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,480
europe-centric than us but

300
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,959
still that was uh the decision-making

301
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,480
factors

302
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,040
and so here's uh the tier one market

303
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,760
says today just to give a comparison

304
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,279
we can see the

305
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,240
number of people here in the msa

306
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720
that's a metropolitan statistical area

307
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,880
so instead of just looking at a city it

308
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,640
also looks at the suburbs around it that

309
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,440
depend on that city

310
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,200
gdp of the state here and kind of

311
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,920
you see you know it's top 15 or so or

312
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,040
pretty well

313
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
represented

314
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,920
so in in our slate of tier 2 markets

315
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,760
over here we kind of fill it out a

316
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,760
little bit with the msa and gdp

317
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,880
you know we did

318
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,959
a number of data centers just to keep it

319
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,720
consistent

320
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,920
this peers column here is

321
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,839
the number of peers that we have as a

322
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,519
network so

323
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,800
you know you can see here that we've

324
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
been you know pushing denver and phoenix

325
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,120
pretty heavily for a while

326
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
and we already have some

327
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,640
you know pretty good interconnectivity

328
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,519
there

329
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,279
a lot of our peers say we're you know

330
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,640
one of the biggest peers in those

331
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,399
markets not surprisingly because of our

332
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,399
footprint

333
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,480
but i would like to add that this is not

334
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,519
something

335
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,200
that's sort of you know self-serving

336
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,079
when i

337
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,200
when i

338
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,760
chaired this thing and when we started

339
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,360
you know arguing over the tier two

340
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,680
cities you know we didn't take things

341
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,720
like

342
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,880
you know who's the prevailing data

343
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,959
center in the market or internet

344
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,200
exchange or you know

345
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
who

346
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,360
you know what what isp is the incumbent

347
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,399
or mso this is just you know purely off

348
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,839
of numbers

349
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,839
population gdp

350
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,399
rtt

351
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,800
um and so you know here in minneapolis

352
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
it already had a pretty

353
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,880
relatively thriving

354
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,200
internet exchange

355
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,519
we also saw quite quite a bit in boston

356
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,880
which was good to see a little

357
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,360
surprising for me

358
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,079
but

359
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,839
so here you know we have these rtt

360
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,279
levels and

361
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,720
by adding

362
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,480
the slate of nine interconnection

363
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,680
markets it lowered the average rtt

364
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,639
across

365
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,800
the entire us by nearly eight

366
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,720
milliseconds

367
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,519
which

368
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,040
you know kind of makes sense you know

369
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,240
you see here

370
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,399
you know philly and boston are a little

371
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,560
bit lower but that was to help offset

372
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,839
new york city which had you know 17 of

373
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,839
the population and

374
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,839
a little less than that as far as the

375
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,279
interconnectivity

376
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,760
uh ingress egress but

377
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,519
um so we needed to offload that a little

378
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,320
bit but the main goal was how do we help

379
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,240
offload chicago

380
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,519
atlanta and dallas

381
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,399
um

382
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,920
you know cleveland made the list here

383
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,680
because by itself

384
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,920
it's not that interesting per se i mean

385
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,040
sorry to any ohioans in the

386
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,760
in the audience here but um

387
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,440
once you add

388
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,279
columbus and cincinnati which are

389
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,160
relatively close

390
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,639
cleveland skyrocketed up to number six

391
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,800
as far as population and 10 in gdp

392
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,399
and then we saw the same thing here with

393
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,839
nashville where it was kind of in the

394
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,279
30s but

395
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,920
you know if you add just memphis and

396
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,680
there's also knoxville and you could

397
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,040
even make the argument of parts of

398
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,399
kentucky

399
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,959
it also jumps into the top 20. and

400
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,320
that's going to be important to help

401
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,800
offload atlanta

402
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,800
so

403
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,199
the light blue here is the the tier one

404
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,360
markets and then the

405
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,199
dark blue are the the tier two markets

406
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,760
that we're proposing as you know an

407
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,399
official slate of tier two markets and

408
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,360
you can see here how the emphasis is to

409
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,600
kind of fill in the center of the map a

410
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,959
little bit

411
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,399
again with the exception here in the

412
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,839
northeast where we had to break up new

413
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,480
york a little bit

414
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,720
um and

415
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,519
this is what it looks like

416
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,800
um

417
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,040
where not only you have the local inter

418
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,880
interconnection in the market

419
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,240
but

420
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,120
all of the neighboring states

421
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,519
get benefit from that as well

422
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,000
so all you know just because you don't

423
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,360
have an interconnection point in

424
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,560
albuquerque

425
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,160
you know going from albuquerque to

426
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,600
phoenix is

427
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,880
well

428
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,040
not significantly but somewhat closer

429
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,720
than going to dallas

430
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,360
uh up here in the north you'll see even

431
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,320
greater gains so you have the

432
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,639
again this sort of gravity well

433
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,240
created where

434
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,680
you know again and you know i went

435
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,120
through and looked at uh not every

436
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,560
single circuit but you know we kind of

437
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,800
filtered it and a lot of these circuits

438
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,000
that were going into chicago or seattle

439
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,040
um actually go on this on this physical

440
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
path especially if it was going here to

441
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
northern california

442
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,199
but you know we see this here as well

443
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,880
and definitely up here

444
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,360
where this is it makes sense that you

445
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,279
can break your circuits out in the

446
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,399
middle there

447
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,959
or just order new circuits or

448
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,160
you know whatever

449
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,839
oh the other thing i should mention too

450
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,199
is that

451
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,199
you know this was only

452
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,600
the the access to the data that i had at

453
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,800
lumen

454
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,160
so

455
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,399
if someone goes and buys you know builds

456
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,800
their own network and you know meets us

457
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
in one of these markets obviously i'm

458
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,480
not going to see where the z end of that

459
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,600
is so

460
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,320
um even the numbers that i have i know

461
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,880
are much lower than you know what what

462
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,480
it would truly look like if you could

463
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,360
take all that into consideration but

464
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,800
i just wanted to throw that out as a

465
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,279
caveat for people that are checking me

466
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,040
on my data analysis skills

467
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,320
so

468
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,639
getting there kind of catches us up to

469
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,120
where we should have been now

470
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,480
you know

471
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,199
again 20 25 years ago all of the peering

472
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,480
was happening in northern virginia

473
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,360
northern california then chicago kind of

474
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,199
got added to the map in miami and

475
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,160
atlanta

476
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,920
but it was it was growing pains and it

477
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,000
took five ten years to get everybody to

478
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,800
interconnect in some of these markets

479
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,600
so

480
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
by adding these tier two

481
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,759
markets we kind of catch up to where we

482
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,639
i feel we should have been today

483
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,560
uh but this is

484
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,759
the next step of where do we go next

485
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,040
and so i had one of my data interns over

486
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,360
the summer put together this map

487
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,360
showing you know the increase in the msa

488
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,559
population

489
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,839
of

490
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,480
all of the top 50 or top 75 u.s markets

491
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,400
and you can see here again a little

492
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,720
surprising to me until i saw the data

493
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,640
was that the southeast of the us has

494
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,679
been growing much more rapidly than the

495
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,359
rest of the country

496
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,799
so

497
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,720
what we need to do next is start

498
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,480
thinking start having the conversation

499
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,120
of where are these even beyond this next

500
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,559
nine

501
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,200
slate of of markets where where where do

502
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,919
we go after this so we don't get behind

503
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,240
again

504
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,400
so you know again i just kind of threw

505
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,520
this

506
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,679
table together you know no decisions

507
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,960
have been made but

508
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,480
you know just kind of things that would

509
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,240
make sense you know

510
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,679
following again

511
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,679
you know inertia where are people

512
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,679
already connecting well some of these

513
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,679
markets there's there's not a lot at

514
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,080
least from our perspective

515
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,520
with the exception of portland you know

516
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,760
that's starting to build up and again

517
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,679
not surprising follow the fiber and all

518
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,440
of that

519
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,360
um but you know there's there's

520
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
interesting um

521
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,760
you know nor north florida makes sense

522
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,400
uh you know from this previous slide you

523
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,320
can see that you know florida is just

524
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,200
exploding from a population density

525
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,880
orlando tampa

526
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,000
and

527
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,080
you know from the slide before that you

528
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,960
could see

529
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,480
that in north florida they don't

530
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,840
actually buy

531
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,000
going south into miami they mostly buy

532
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,320
up into atlanta so that would be a good

533
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,720
place to kind of you know cut things out

534
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,840
um

535
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,280
charlotte was you know one of the

536
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,520
largest bubbles there the the size of

537
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,400
the circle was the you know increase of

538
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,480
the percentage

539
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,520
um

540
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,360
you know detroit could make sense a lot

541
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,000
of the fiber coming into the us out of

542
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,559
canada actually goes through detroit so

543
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,000
that could be a better place to break

544
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,320
out certainly better than chicago is

545
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,559
which is where a lot of it goes today

546
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,799
um you know cleveland in the in the tier

547
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,799
two markets

548
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,720
um would be a good place to break it out

549
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,160
too but you know detroit would make

550
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,360
sense

551
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,840
southern california is huge either san

552
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,160
diego maybe riverside

553
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,320
would make sense in the future

554
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,400
um you know breaking up the northwest a

555
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,160
little bit more adding

556
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,120
you know portland vegas boise from an rt

557
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
rtt perspective certainly makes a lot of

558
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,280
sense maybe not as much from a msa

559
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,960
perspective

560
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,799
um but

561
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,440
so this is the the long range planning

562
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,000
that we're just now endeavoring to start

563
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,520
so i promise you at the beginning i'd

564
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,360
show you the punch line from the same

565
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,200
study that we did for europe

566
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,520
uh these are sort of the the seven

567
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,000
tier one interconnectivity markets in uh

568
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,600
in europe

569
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,760
and uh you know we did the same thing

570
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,640
looked at a and z ends population rtt et

571
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,000
cetera

572
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,120
and this is the slate of seven

573
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,039
tier two markets that

574
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,159
we're

575
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,640
gonna start pushing uh from from our

576
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,919
perspective with our peering partners

577
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,760
marseille some people could argue is

578
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,039
already there

579
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,360
it almost is it's pretty close but we

580
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,679
don't quite have everybody there yet but

581
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,799
it's close

582
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,919
but some of these other markets here um

583
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,000
again the the main

584
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,480
goal here there wasn't a triangle of

585
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,400
chicago dallas atlanta

586
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,280
but

587
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,400
um frankfurt here was

588
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,200
the

589
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,440
800 pound gorilla of europe

590
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,520
and so a lot of the

591
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,600
work went into looking at fiber outs and

592
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,919
populations and seeing you know how do

593
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,159
we keep the central and eastern europe

594
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,960
traffic local

595
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,679
so to summarize in the u.s we have

596
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,320
an over-reliance of connectivity in

597
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,159
these nine markets

598
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,600
um there's huge swaths of land that you

599
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,400
know

600
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,320
causes you know over

601
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,640
20 30 milliseconds to switch off net

602
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,039
1000 miles

603
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,760
um you have this idea of social inertia

604
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,159
where people are buying their circuits

605
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,400
remotely instead of locally

606
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,080
because it's sort of this chicken and

607
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,520
egg you know

608
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,120
why buy it local if it's just going to

609
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,600
go remote to switch off anyway so we

610
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
want to be able to reinforce you know

611
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,640
buy local switch local

612
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,720
and you know again as i mentioned on the

613
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,799
first or second slide

614
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,880
you know our internet is not just uh a

615
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,320
project anymore

616
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,159
you know there's billions tens of

617
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,480
billions trillions of dollars

618
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
of business that people are putting on

619
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,280
the internet and we have to adapt and

620
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,159
you know be be responsive to

621
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,640
the future the current the the present

622
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,240
and the future of where the internet

623
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,799
needs to go

624
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,240
so

625
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,000
you know this isn't the first time i've

626
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,200
given

627
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,039
sorry this isn't the first time i've

628
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,960
given this presentation

629
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,760
i've seen sylvie give it before tom

630
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,280
paseka has given it before

631
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,440
so really you know what makes this

632
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,799
different than some of those other

633
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,480
presentations

634
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,320
and that's that

635
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,760
we have just updated our peering policy

636
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,480
to say that not only are we going to

637
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,320
expect interconnection in the tier 1

638
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,880
markets but at least to start off with

639
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,600
two thirds of the tier two market

640
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,400
that we've proposed

641
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,120
so

642
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,960
a little bit of data a little bit of

643
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,320
policy

644
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,120
and uh we'll open the

645
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,520
i guess mike for questions or any

646
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,039
questions that have come in online

647
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,520
oh

648
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,840
but

649
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,959
any questions from the audience

650
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,720
i see john

651
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,280
it's john kristoff have you done

652
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,080
analysis on what the breakdown is of

653
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,640
the the current peers who

654
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,960
may be leaving on the addition of what

655
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,799
you might gain so the percent percentage

656
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,240
add or drop from this change in policy

657
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,720
you mean how much traffic would would

658
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,640
migrate from one of the tier one to the

659
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,679
tier two markets so just if a network

660
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,039
would actually um not satisfy your your

661
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,880
peering policy to be able to appear or

662
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,799
would qualify okay

663
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,120
yeah um that's something that we are

664
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,799
cognizant of that there are some

665
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,200
networks that don't operate in some of

666
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,360
the markets that we're proposing

667
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,960
and so that's why

668
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,720
you know we're not trying to

669
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,480
mandate all nine or all seven

670
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,400
you know we're gonna say we want the

671
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,480
majority we kind of settled on two

672
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,000
thirds to give us about six out of the

673
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,919
nine markets in the u.s and five out of

674
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,080
the seven in europe

675
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,080
we think that's a reasonable

676
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,120
number

677
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,200
because again you know

678
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,799
not to get into the peering policy

679
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,320
philosophy too too much but

680
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,200
you know we kind of want to peer with

681
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,640
other networks of our scale and size so

682
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,240
you know i don't it's not asking too

683
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,880
much but again we make we recognize that

684
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,000
not everyone's going to be able to meet

685
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
us in every one of these markets and so

686
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,520
that's why that little leeway was built

687
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,360
in

688
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,919
we have one online question sure from

689
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,159
matt

690
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,360
will this be accompanied

691
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,679
by relaxing peering requirements to

692
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,679
allow more local peering in those tier

693
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,919
two cities

694
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,880
well

695
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,760
that was the the peering requirements

696
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,400
other than you know adding this one was

697
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,240
were not changed so

698
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,400
it's still again you know kind of

699
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,039
harking back to the my last answer you

700
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,200
know we're looking for you know peers of

701
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,080
similar scale size

702
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,200
scope

703
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,919
so

704
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,880
the the policy is doesn't change just

705
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
because we are expanding the the

706
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,120
geographic reach of the interconnection

707
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,799
hi chris whitfield twitter

708
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,200
are these new peer requirements going to

709
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,400
be

710
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,919
applied to new

711
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,960
peering applicants only or is this going

712
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,880
to result in any deep hearings of

713
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,720
existing peering partners that don't

714
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,400
meet those requirements

715
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,039
so again

716
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,200
we're not

717
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,440
we're not creating this to create any

718
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,360
friction or deep hearing events

719
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,760
we we do expect again that there's going

720
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,240
to be some networks that that don't

721
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,120
operate in every one of these markets so

722
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,600
again we built some leeway in there you

723
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,480
know maybe

724
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,320
maybe we revisit that in the future but

725
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,440
there's there's no plans to do that but

726
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,520
i guess to answer the the basic part of

727
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,440
your question is yes it applies to new

728
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,960
and existing peers

729
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,919
thank you

730
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,840
got another online question from

731
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,159
jonathan how much traffic do you expect

732
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,640
to move from the tier one cities to the

733
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,600
tier two cities

734
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,840
that's a good question

735
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,000
um i don't have

736
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,120
the answer for you i i would say my gut

737
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,520
would tell me that we would probably

738
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,919
see a shift about a quarter

739
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,760
quarter of the traffic at least maybe

740
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,880
more

741
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,039
but that's just again my gut feel

742
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,799
there's no

743
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,799
there's nothing behind that other than

744
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,760
you know what i think will happen

745
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,240
round of applause for guy

746
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,080
thank you very much thank you mike

747
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,320
thanks everyone

748
