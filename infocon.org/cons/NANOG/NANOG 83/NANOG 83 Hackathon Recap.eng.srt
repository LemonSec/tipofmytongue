00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,440
welcome to the nanog 83 hackathon this

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,599
is our first hybrid event that means we

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,480
are finally back in person and online i

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,880
myself am joining the in-person location

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,680
which is taking place in minneapolis so

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,520
jeff what is it like to be back in

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,400
person uh it's been been really great so

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,920
far today um

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,920
this is the the first time i've really

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,800
done any work related travel since the

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,880
pandemic started so

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,120
it's been great to get back together and

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,719
see people i haven't seen in person in a

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,719
long time what's been the atmosphere

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,760
like at the in-person location it's been

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,600
quiet um i mean previous in-person

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,440
hackathons we've had the room filled

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,559
with people

20
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,440
um

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,320
it's still a little sparse we've got

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,480
some people here in person and

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,239
and still a lot of people participating

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,360
remote

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,800
it being like i said before this is our

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,359
first hybrid event what has worked what

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,840
hasn't uh one of the changes we did this

28
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,159
time is we had a

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,560
rather than try to do the introductory

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,439
presentations and tutorials

31
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,760
the morning the hackathon starts they

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,000
were done a week in advance

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,320
to give people time to absorb the

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,439
material and

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,720
more time to form teams

36
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
when we did the the virtual only

37
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,759
hackathons it was a lot to fit in

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,439
and uh

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,799
so this gave

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,040
teams more time to form and get ready

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,280
for the event i mean is that a big deal

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,799
it seems like that would be a big deal

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,280
like a big game changer i i think that's

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,280
it helped out a lot and i think it's

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,200
probably something we make

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,600
consider continuing in the future for uh

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,439
other hackathons is there anything

48
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,119
differently you would do next meeting

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,640
nothing that i can think of right now

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,479
but we'll have to look at the feedback

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,560
we get from this event and

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,479
and see if we have any uh good

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,640
suggestions from the participants and

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,439
this is such a passion sport uh what

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,320
have you been most impressed about this

56
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,440
nanog83 meeting i think just the fact

57
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
that we had teams forming in advance we

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
had uh

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,000
at least one team that came in with a

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,680
very well-formed

61
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,680
idea and they were able to use that to

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,800
recruit team members with and i guess

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,000
i'd like to see more of that in the

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,680
future of

65
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,920
of people coming in with uh good solid

66
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,520
ideas for

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,599
for people to work on how did that help

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,360
the process i think

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,760
in the past at hackathons people came in

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,800
with

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,560
with an idea that they just quickly

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,400
presented in a little minute

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
presentation

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,120
um this time having a uh

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,519
somebody come in with a well-formed idea

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,920
that was uh thought out with some goals

77
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,440
i think

78
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,360
probably helped recruit team members to

79
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,760
their effort so i'm going to interview

80
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,959
those

81
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,920
incredible participants uh

82
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,120
let me start with kendall

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,120
kendall you're joining us virtually

84
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,200
where are you at i'm i'm in seattle

85
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,080
washington it's a beautiful day here so

86
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,239
what was the best part for you

87
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,280
in this hackathon experience

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,840
uh i mean obviously uh the access to the

89
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,760
resources and all the equipment and all

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,720
the work that went into setting

91
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,920
everything up uh but i think the mentors

92
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,640
were really fantastic

93
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,400
they really did a lot of preparation i

94
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
didn't have to do a lot of interaction

95
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
with them i was trying to figure some

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,040
things out on my own

97
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,720
but it was really helpful to know that

98
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,480
they were always available

99
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,400
if i needed some additional assistance

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,599
what did you find most challenging

101
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,879
um i'm fairly new to a lot of the tools

102
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,560
and the applications and the stuff that

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
is available uh

104
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,959
so there's a lot of learning for me but

105
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,400
i was very excited about that i had a

106
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
really great time i worked all night on

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,239
this

108
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,000
but uh you know trying to get used to

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,760
some of the environment and some of the

110
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,080
techniques and how things work uh

111
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
i found the firewall operating system a

112
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,000
little clunky but uh

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,720
you know i i made my way through it um

114
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,720
but it was great and you mentioned that

115
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,680
you were up most the night doing this

116
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,160
yeah yeah yeah and i also appreciated

117
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,160
the fact that uh i was at the meeting

118
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,320
last week uh when they kicked us off and

119
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,800
having extra time to set up my

120
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,440
environment and get prepared and do a

121
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,040
little advanced work i think was really

122
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,280
helpful so i could spend more time

123
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,960
concentrating on this throughout the

124
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,040
weekend so what would you say to someone

125
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,440
who hadn't ever experienced hackathon

126
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
you know if you can do a little bit of

127
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,280
research uh do a little bit of

128
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,280
preparation ahead of time

129
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,240
but either way just just reach out

130
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,639
make an effort and show up

131
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,720
don't be afraid to ask for help people

132
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,320
are great

133
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,479
no matter what level you're coming in at

134
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,520
there's something that you can do to

135
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,800
participate and you will definitely

136
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
learn something

137
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,720
all right awesome kendall thank you so

138
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,280
much we're great words of advice don't

139
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,360
be afraid to ask for help

140
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,440
i would love to talk to somebody who is

141
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,160
in that hackathon room jeff could you

142
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,840
point me to the next person

143
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,120
so leo is an anag83 hackathon

144
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,160
participant leo how did it go for you it

145
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,000
went very well this is the first

146
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,600
hackathon i have ever participated in

147
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,919
and i was well supported by

148
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,639
people at nanog and also

149
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,880
by colleagues at peering db

150
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,039
and

151
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,360
we got a result and uh very happy with

152
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,520
that and how did that support help you

153
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,080
along your journey well

154
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,479
basically i didn't know how hackathons

155
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,360
work

156
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,120
and so

157
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,080
i

158
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,120
came up

159
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,639
uh with

160
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,319
this is what i think might be needed and

161
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,280
i went and asked people and

162
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,240
you know

163
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,880
i was told yes sort of that

164
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,199
and you know maybe refine this and

165
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,520
i came up with some test cases ahead of

166
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,840
time because i thought if if i was a

167
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
developer and i'm not a software

168
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,880
developer but if i was a software

169
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,039
developer i'd probably want to know

170
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,919
whether my code was working or not and

171
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,960
so

172
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,120
i came up with some test cases and um

173
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,919
you know

174
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,199
some of them were a little bit

175
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,039
borderline should we go with this way or

176
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,960
that way and that was

177
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,479
more towards

178
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,120
product feature design i suppose but

179
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,759
that's sort of fine because

180
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,520
um this isn't

181
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,800
a formal

182
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,000
product development environment this is

183
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
an environment to

184
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,440
make things

185
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,400
better and to test

186
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,759
and so it's absolutely fine to go and

187
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,400
say well do we want it to go like this

188
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
or would it be better to go and do

189
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,919
something else

190
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,440
we

191
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,479
you know

192
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,400
definitely solved

193
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,560
at least 90 percent of the problem you

194
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,440
know probably 99 of the problem and

195
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,360
we've got a couple of little tweaks that

196
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,400
we might

197
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,520
um work on for the final

198
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,280
version that gets integrated into the

199
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,800
release but you know we we have uh come

200
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,080
up with

201
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,880
um a genuine improvement that's going to

202
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,199
make the lives of everyone who uses

203
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,479
peering db

204
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,199
better from now on and

205
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,360
uh i think that's great how does that

206
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,319
feel

207
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,319
it feels really good because

208
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,840
you know i didn't come up with the idea

209
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,960
for what the problem was but i helped

210
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,880
put the structure in place to make sure

211
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,120
that the developers could be as

212
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,520
successful as they could possibly be

213
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,080
and they were very successful because

214
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,400
they not only solved

215
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,039
our problem for peering db

216
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,680
they also found a bug and we were able

217
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,120
to get the bug fixed so you know that's

218
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,479
two benefits

219
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,599
and um as i think i mentioned it was the

220
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,160
first time that we had had volunteer

221
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,840
developers use our development

222
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,280
environment and they empirically tested

223
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,479
it and

224
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,840
the code is

225
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,919
good and it's going to be integrated

226
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,039
into release so that means we now know

227
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,280
that volunteer developers can use this

228
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,840
environment successfully doesn't mean

229
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,720
that it's perfect but it's workable and

230
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,800
we know that we've got to make some

231
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,159
improvements to some of the

232
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,479
documentation that goes along with it

233
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,000
and we will go and do that and next time

234
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,120
we go and do a hackathon project we'll

235
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,200
have better documentation to make the

236
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,320
lives of

237
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,040
volunteer developers easier

238
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,680
do you have any words for of wisdom

239
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,399
for what you said about finding workable

240
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,200
solutions rather than perfect solutions

241
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,959
we came with a relatively small

242
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,800
thing to achieve which meant that we

243
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,720
were able to achieve the whole thing

244
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,200
over the weekend and

245
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,120
that meant that there was

246
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,959
room to

247
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,760
go and put a little bit of time into

248
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,760
doing something which could go one way

249
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,880
and could go another way and it was fine

250
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,120
to go and say well we'll go like this

251
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,200
and then in the future we can go and

252
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,240
make changes if we need to make changes

253
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,160
um so

254
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,720
if i was to make a suggestion i would

255
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,160
suggest that relatively small projects

256
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,839
are something that you can do

257
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,440
in a quick amount of time and you can

258
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,320
have a little bit of time to

259
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,170
change your design and

260
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,279
[Music]

261
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,360
still have something that

262
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,399
is going to deliver a result that can go

263
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,240
to production

264
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,279
um if you go for something big

265
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,680
then it's more challenging that doesn't

266
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,839
mean that big projects shouldn't come to

267
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,399
a hackathon um i mean this is my first

268
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,640
hackathon who am i to be an authority

269
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,200
but um you know it's it's more

270
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,160
challenging to do something really

271
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,680
uh big vision this was a tight vision it

272
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,200
meant there was room to

273
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,440
um play around

274
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
my name is charles rumford i'm a network

275
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,079
engineer for an msp out of chicago

276
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,399
called deaf.com so you are joining us in

277
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,079
person what is it like to be an

278
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,240
in-person participant uh being an

279
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,079
in-person participant it's a little

280
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,920
weird the first day

281
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,000
working out of my actual hotel room was

282
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
a little strange but it's been great the

283
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,440
second day as part of the hybrid event

284
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,120
being in a room with people being able

285
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,519
to interact with people

286
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,440
has been really great so what did you

287
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,600
find most challenging

288
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
i think starting with

289
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,959
the end of last week when we had our

290
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,240
introductions

291
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,399
figuring out what to work on

292
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,640
was probably the most challenging

293
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,399
i'm not the most

294
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,279
adept software developer

295
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,560
and so uh i was trying to find something

296
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,360
that was both functional and fairly

297
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,920
simple to very quick to work on

298
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,079
um and that took a little while until uh

299
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,880
a meeting at work uh this week that was

300
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,760
like oh that i should write that why did

301
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,720
you choose the topic that you chose

302
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,600
um we've had a couple of uh events uh

303
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,920
network events in our at our at my job

304
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,240
that there is some information that

305
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,519
would have been great to have that we

306
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,040
didn't have

307
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,480
and so i wanted to write something that

308
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,079
we could collect that information and be

309
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,680
able to query it in a reasonable fashion

310
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,360
and as mentioned before this is the

311
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,800
first time that we've started the

312
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,720
hackathon a week early

313
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,440
how did that work for you it was really

314
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,959
great to know

315
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,079
uh what resources were available to us

316
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,040
for the actual duration of the hackathon

317
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,440
and what the expectations were and being

318
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,280
able to

319
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,680
[Music]

320
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,120
mingle with other people who were doing

321
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,839
the hackathon to

322
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,079
figure out what to work on or what

323
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,560
projects were available

324
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,680
i've done other non-hat nano hackathons

325
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,519
in the past and getting all that

326
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,839
information on the day of and then

327
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,360
having to rush to figure out what to

328
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,560
work on

329
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,040
um is quite annoying

330
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,120
i can imagine i had so what did you

331
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,760
learn about yourself during this process

332
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,120
i think the biggest thing for me is

333
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,639
making sure i'm editing the right file

334
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,880
when i'm figuring out what uh when i'm

335
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,600
trying to configure things um

336
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,240
i think the other thing is is uh and it

337
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,519
was this is an event that's kind of

338
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,760
