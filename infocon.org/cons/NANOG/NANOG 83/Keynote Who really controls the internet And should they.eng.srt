00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,839
hello and welcome to this presentation

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,559
who control he controls the internet

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,320
and if they actually should

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,040
and

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,960
you can see i cover all grounds here all

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,400
kinds of flags are on here all kinds of

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,840
companies

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,279
but don't worry

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,680
none of them comes out well

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,480
so first a little introduction who am i

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,480
my name is bertry bear i'm from the

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,560
netherlands i'm from europe i'm the

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,560
founder of powerdns

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,640
and powerdns is a nameserver an open

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,320
source nameserver company and that does

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,280
around half of all dns in europe

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,960
i no longer work there but that's my

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,360
history since 1999.

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,360
um after that i worked for a while for

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,399
the dutch intelligence agency which gave

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,760
me a whole new

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,239
outlook on the internet and on the world

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,760
but after a while i decided to leave

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,559
that again to focus on paradinas

26
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,600
and after many years of power dns

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,520
i have recently again moved to the dark

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,359
side and then i'm now a

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,760
judge in a sort of the dutch fisa court

30
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,199
which regulates the intelligence

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,560
agencies

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,040
why do i tell you this stuff

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,200
because in this presentation i'm going

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,920
to spread a lot of love or mostly hate

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,759
on various countries and various

36
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,920
companies on how they run the internet

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,159
and i want you to be sure that i am only

38
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,159
speaking on behalf of myself and on

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,400
behalf of no one else

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,880
and i also kindly ask you in the q a

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,479
that follows this presentation to be

42
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,400
aware that there are many things that i

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,560
cannot talk about on countries and

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,479
policies so please do not ask me about

45
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,600
that

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,079
but anyhow during this time as an open

47
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,640
source developer and a government worker

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,840
i have seen

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,079
quite a bit of the internet and who may

50
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,360
be controlling it or not

51
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,079
so

52
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,720
who controls the internet

53
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,600
this presentation will upset everyone we

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,640
all have our dreams our hopes our

55
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,799
heroes on the internet are

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,240
evil people on the internet and

57
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,840
in this presentation i will cover all of

58
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,520
these and talk about who actually

59
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,600
controls the internet if you are not

60
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,199
upset by the end of this presentation

61
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,520
you are not paying attention

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,680
the scope of who controls the internet

63
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,920
is very broad so when i discussed this

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,840
presentation with people beforehand many

65
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,959
people said look

66
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,720
my local internet exchange controls the

67
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,000
internet or bgp controls the internet or

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,480
i control the internet actually

69
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,000
and um

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,959
and

71
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,959
that's not actually the scope of this

72
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,239
presentation the scope of this

73
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,599
presentation is

74
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,800
way bigger

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,920
so

76
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
who makes the internet fast for some

77
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,319
people and slow for others who makes it

78
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,120
easy to access some kind of internet

79
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,800
and makes it hard to access other kinds

80
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,040
of internet who can make it cheap who

81
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,680
can make it expensive so this is a far

82
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,840
broader presentation than just where do

83
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,360
the packets go

84
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,599
um finally important this presentation

85
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,000
is not about as geeks because

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,560
as geeks we are like hey i can no one

87
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,800
controls my internet i will i'm behind

88
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,760
seven proxies um i will always be able

89
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,519
to get myself be out of any kind of

90
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,200
internet control and that's probably

91
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,959
true although i know people that lived

92
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,800
in china that had to give up

93
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
they said look this control is now so

94
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,440
stringent i can no longer bypass it but

95
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,280
this presentation is not so much about

96
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,239
us it is about what how normal people

97
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,000
access the internet and how they go

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,959
online without too much trouble so this

99
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,720
is not about well financed freedom

100
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,120
fighters it is about how regular people

101
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,159
around the world get access to internet

102
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,000
and it turns out there are quite some

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,560
naive ideas behind that

104
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,239
when i discussed this presentation on

105
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,280
twitter

106
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,280
earlier today

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,360
the internet governance project came up

108
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,920
and said no one controls the internet

109
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,080
because large complex distributed

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,959
systems are not controlled by whose

111
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,720
and i would like to tell that to the

112
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,879
people in north korea or iran that

113
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,680
cannot access my content actually people

114
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,480
do

115
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,920
control the internet around the world

116
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,280
and things may be

117
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,599
more complex than you think in other

118
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,599
countries because the world is a big

119
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,720
place

120
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,280
and we know very little strangely enough

121
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,599
about how the internet works in various

122
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,439
countries

123
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,279
for example during the recent big

124
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,759
facebook and whatsapp outage we found

125
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,240
out that many parts of the internet

126
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,080
of many parts of the world the internet

127
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,240
actually means the facebook part of the

128
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,400
internet which is something i was

129
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,960
not actually aware of

130
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,240
so

131
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
who wants to control the internet well

132
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,320
there are democratically elected

133
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,240
governments that say we have interests

134
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,440
to protect

135
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,520
there are authoritarian governments and

136
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,199
regimes that say well we have to protect

137
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,880
ourselves and we want to make sure that

138
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,000
the internet

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,400
only has happy news about us

140
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
we have rights holders that say we don't

141
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,400
want you to use the internet to share

142
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,880
our valuable intellectual property

143
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,560
there are activists that say look we

144
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,240
want you to share this kind of content

145
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,479
and not that kind of content

146
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,120
the big movers and shakers of this world

147
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,440
right now are advertising agencies

148
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,160
like google which influence the internet

149
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,080
greatly so that they can continue their

150
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,680
way of life

151
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,759
corporations would like to exert control

152
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,000
of the internet as do of course schools

153
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,800
and institutions but also do not rule

154
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,639
out yourself because

155
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,639
i'm all for an open and free internet

156
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,479
and i want information to be free but

157
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,680
not spam

158
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,400
i do not want spam on my network

159
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,960
i want an open and free internet without

160
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,680
controls but i also believe in pcp38 so

161
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,120
i don't want you to be using the wrong

162
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,800
ip addresses so

163
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,880
it is not just governments

164
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,960
really everyone wants to control the

165
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,400
internet at least for a little bit

166
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,440
so

167
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,759
let's start with the most controlled bit

168
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,080
of the internet in the world north korea

169
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,919
north korea actually has a few people

170
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,680
that are really on the internet and a

171
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,400
lot of people that are on the guangmion

172
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,639
or bright light north korean intranet

173
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,240
the country is small enough that it all

174
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,639
fits in 10 8

175
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,319
and they have a sort of internet going

176
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,720
on it is their own private internet

177
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,199
which they are sadly not sharing

178
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,960
with the world so we know

179
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,639
very little about what is actually on

180
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,199
this bright light internet

181
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,120
but sometimes things leak so it turns

182
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,880
out they have their own email system

183
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,039
they have their own search engine they

184
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,160
have a sort of highly curated facebook

185
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,000
and they even have video conferencing

186
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,440
solutions that they built themselves

187
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,360
which were used

188
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,240
more during the corona outbreak even and

189
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,639
they have made their own uh specifically

190
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,880
modified android tablets and they have a

191
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,440
linux operating system so these people

192
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,319
really run their own internet and it's

193
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,759
probably not even

194
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,240
correct to call it an internet

195
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,319
um of specific interests are these

196
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,080
modified android tablets that were

197
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,160
rumored to be fully controlled and

198
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,240
tracked and they they keep track of

199
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,759
everything you do and that's just

200
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,199
terrible and then i realized that's

201
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,800
actually what actual android tablets

202
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,960
also do but they do it on behalf of

203
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,720
advertisers and in this case they do it

204
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,680
on behalf of the north korean government

205
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,000
why is this north korea example still

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,599
relevant

207
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,759
it may be that more and more countries

208
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,240
will gravitate towards actually running

209
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,720
their own internet instead of

210
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,199
being part of the big internet

211
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,080
um

212
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,520
furthest along in that is china and

213
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,240
china actually sort of runs a shadow

214
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,680
internet they have their own root

215
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,759
servers they they have their own

216
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,280
everything

217
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
which of course is massively controlled

218
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,039
it's not a free place

219
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,400
it barely is

220
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,720
the internet and it's maybe more fair to

221
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,639
just call it china net

222
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
and

223
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,599
they don't use block information they

224
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,759
don't like they also impose slowdowns or

225
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,080
reset packets on content that they don't

226
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,840
like so they have ways of signaling that

227
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,360
look uh the information you are looking

228
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,680
for um you shouldn't you should not be

229
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,919
looking for that chinese people know to

230
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,560
interpret bad internet connections as oh

231
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,160
maybe i shouldn't be going there and

232
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,680
actually sort of more

233
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,680
effective than simply blocking

234
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,680
everything

235
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,919
interestingly china is one of the very

236
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,160
few places in the world that could

237
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,759
actually disconnect itself from the

238
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,000
internet so they have enough parallel

239
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,919
stuff going on they have their own

240
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,520
payment systems they have their own

241
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,919
cloud infrastructure they have their own

242
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,080
storage solutions

243
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,840
if the internet and china were to be

244
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,839
disconnected from the world china would

245
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,080
keep on functioning

246
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,039
and

247
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,399
the other interesting thing is is that

248
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,320
they apparently have some kind of board

249
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,640
or whatever because there are many

250
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,480
chinese companies that are actually on

251
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,120
facebook and are on twitter and there

252
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,000
are also individual scientists and space

253
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,200
flight people and that are somehow able

254
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,040
to publicly go

255
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,640
online and it appears there is some kind

256
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,040
of board there that can grant you access

257
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,760
to

258
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,080
the real internet and interestingly

259
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,240
enough we don't really know how the

260
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,920
chinese internet works and we should

261
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,959
know

262
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,120
far more about that because many

263
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,959
countries in the west are selling stuff

264
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,519
in china and it would be good if we all

265
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,680
knew how how that worked there but there

266
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,839
is some sort of cone of silence around

267
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,920
the internet in china that no one is

268
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,560
keeping track of just how that works and

269
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,800
which means that periodically people in

270
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
the west suddenly discover that there is

271
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,360
a whole different chinese internet

272
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,959
ecosystem out there that we know very

273
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,360
little about

274
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,600
does china run the internet

275
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,440
well these they very much run their own

276
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,480
internet

277
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,640
but periodically they they come out and

278
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,360
try to get the ietf or the itu or other

279
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,800
people to pass

280
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,720
standards that make the internet well

281
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
maybe more to china's

282
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,640
liking and um

283
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,240
their their current efforts are a bit

284
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,120
ham-fisted in that respect um i was

285
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
personally involved with an attempt from

286
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,959
them or at least they sent their attempt

287
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,600
to me for sort of multi-route internet

288
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,160
which would sort of codify that there is

289
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,079
a chinese internet and a real internet

290
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,079
and that you can switch between these

291
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,120
two

292
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,360
um but so far we're yeah we're not

293
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,839
really interested in running their new

294
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,560
ip system

295
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,320
wow there are lots of other countries of

296
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
course that want to mess with the

297
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,880
internet for for their own reasons and

298
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,399
um it turns out that it's quite

299
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,040
difficult to block parts of the internet

300
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,360
uh china can do it but they

301
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,680
invested quite a bit in their the great

302
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,839
chinese firewall and other countries

303
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,360
also want to do it but they're just not

304
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,959
as good at it or they don't have enough

305
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,560
good people for it or they don't spend

306
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,000
enough money on it

307
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,880
so

308
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,920
turkey

309
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,720
indonesia iran

310
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,160
all run dns based blocks or bgp high jx

311
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
for content that they don't like

312
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,800
um they may also try to block third

313
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,760
party

314
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,399
dns they might try to block dns over

315
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,519
https they are iran for example is

316
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,240
running some not so very effective

317
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,040
server name indication based blocking by

318
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,640
which they can also block

319
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,040
select tls traffic and but they're just

320
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,680
not very good at it and

321
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,959
turkey for example blocked

322
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,519
the wikipedia for around three years and

323
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,600
which is tremendously sad of course and

324
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,200
they didn't do a very good job blocking

325
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,040
it because over the three years that

326
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,959
they blocked it the turkish wikipedia

327
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,480
grew by 30 000 articles so

328
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,079
apparently people

329
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,399
could actually access it or 40 000

330
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,079
articles

331
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,160
a fun thing is that i came up with i

332
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,079
know a lot of people in iran i have some

333
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,040
remote family members there and distant

334
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,120
family members and they told me yeah we

335
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
all use a vpn and i was very impressed i

336
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,120
thought these people are so privacy

337
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
conscious and i said no no it's the only

338
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,440
way to get somewhat performant internet

339
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,920
here because if you don't use a vpn you

340
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,040
go through the interception

341
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,399
infrastructure and it's like super

342
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,880
overloaded so we use vpn to get fast

343
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,079
internet and

344
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,519
crucially and i was very impressed by

345
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,240
that we also have no hopes that the vpn

346
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,560
actually gives us privacy

347
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,160
because they were aware that many of the

348
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,639
vpn providers out there are not actually

349
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,480
that good in terms of providing privacy

350
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,880
but at least they're good at providing

351
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,120
faster internet access in iran so these

352
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,560
are the countries that sort of want to

353
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,240
block the internet control the internet

354
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,839
but they're not quite succeeding at it

355
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,720
ah russia

356
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,839
russia has a a telecommunications agency

357
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,920
called orozcom nadzor

358
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,839
and i have a personal beef with them

359
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,440
because they blocked my own domain

360
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,320
powerdns.com for years and years and

361
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,600
years and

362
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,839
we tried to find out how and why and

363
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,160
what have we done wrong and sometimes

364
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,839
powerdean has got blocked because there

365
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,279
are people that block anything that has

366
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,200
to do with alternative dns but that

367
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,399
wasn't it

368
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,120
and we found out that previously roscom

369
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,920
nazar had been waging war on various

370
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,079
internet services and and they were not

371
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,079
winning that war so they were simply

372
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,800
blocking huge amounts of ip space from

373
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,959
amazon and

374
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,399
digitalocean

375
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,639
and and they blocked like millions of ip

376
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,800
addresses including by accident power

377
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,440
dns so and i felt doubly bad because i

378
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,360
was censored in russia and i was sort of

379
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,880
proud about that and then i found out it

380
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,200
was by accident

381
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,760
over time russia learned that this this

382
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,720
white blocking hurt the economy too much

383
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,880
because they don't unlike china they

384
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
don't yet have a homegrown payment

385
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,839
system

386
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,760
and homegrown clouds that are good

387
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,000
enough so if russia decides to block too

388
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,839
much of the internet

389
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,079
their own country suffers too much but

390
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,040
they're trying to get more homegrown

391
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,279
payment infrastructure

392
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,360
which would allow them to do more of the

393
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,800
internet themselves

394
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,399
and and would allow them to block other

395
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,600
people's internet more easily

396
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,839
that brings us to

397
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,880
yeah the united kingdom um the united

398
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,519
kingdom is a an outlier in the sense

399
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,040
that it's a big country it's an

400
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,480
important country

401
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,800
uh they have lots of people there

402
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,040
and strangely enough

403
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,920
they have an active internet censorship

404
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,440
program going on

405
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,959
which is not quite legally enforced so

406
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,399
the uk government told all the

407
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,079
large-scale internet access providers

408
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,480
they said look you must provide internet

409
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,279
child safe internet by default

410
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,120
and there's no legislation that forces

411
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,639
them to do it but the government said

412
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,560
look if you don't do it voluntarily we

413
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,959
were going to make some legislation for

414
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,000
you

415
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,399
and these isps had to build

416
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,000
this this child safe internet

417
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,920
infrastructure which meant that they had

418
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,600
to instrument their backbone so that

419
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,639
they could block all kinds of content

420
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,880
and they bought big lists of data of

421
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,800
sites that were not safe for children

422
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,240
and while they were at it they bought

423
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,079
these big lists that also categorized

424
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,519
all other sites

425
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,680
and strangely enough at least in one

426
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,320
place that enabled an isp to filter so

427
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,560
granularly that they could filter out

428
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,399
shoe stores

429
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,720
and i'm not sure why why any engineer

430
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,360
would build a block for shoe stores but

431
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,199
apparently it happened

432
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,040
and

433
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,720
the weird thing is if you want to turn

434
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
off this child safe internet in the uk

435
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,160
you get a letter

436
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,600
and they send you this letter that tells

437
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,440
you look you opted out of the filtering

438
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,959
apparently you want to look at adult

439
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,079
material and you can find webfora

440
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,199
in the uk

441
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,760
where uh people ask well what does this

442
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,680
letter look like and when does it arrive

443
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,839
and what is on the envelope all in hopes

444
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,000
that they can intercept that letter and

445
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,519
these might be husbands these might be

446
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,680
children's i don't know but it's a

447
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,040
strange system

448
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,120
the other strange thing about the uk

449
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,360
well strange notable thing

450
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,519
is that they they are mad for football

451
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,199
over there and everyone is mad for for

452
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,560
english football

453
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,680
and

454
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,680
but there's so much streaming going on

455
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,079
and so much lawsuits that uk isps now

456
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,920
routinely get court orders that say you

457
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,399
must block these illegal streaming sites

458
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,560
and has gone so far that that internet

459
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,040
providers actually preemptively hunt

460
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,519
for these streamers so that before big

461
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,680
matches they they look where the

462
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,440
websites suddenly get a little more

463
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,680
traffic and then they visit those sites

464
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,120
and they're all they're streamers then

465
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,199
because they it's not a lucky accident

466
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,880
that just before the arsenal match

467
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,720
starts that suddenly you have 500

468
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,800
megabits of internet going somewhere and

469
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,440
then they blocked them so this is quite

470
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,160
preemptive and i i don't know the scale

471
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,480
of this but even this week five service

472
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,040
providers were asked to block a ton of

473
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,639
streamers

474
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,399
um the final one is that the uk is

475
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,920
working on

476
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,320
the online safety bill which means that

477
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,000
they've created a new category of

478
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,720
content called lawful but harmful

479
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,800
and access to that content must somehow

480
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,399
be regulated

481
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,000
and and they're having a lot of soul

482
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,680
searching going on right now what that

483
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,920
means but importantly they have already

484
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,880
said that

485
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,959
any foreign content provider that that

486
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,800
has business in the uk will have to

487
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,360
adhere to this lawful but harmful

488
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,160
content regulation so the uk is making a

489
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,680
strong effort

490
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,520
to control the internet

491
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,799
ah the european union

492
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,919
they love regulation so the gdpr that

493
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,119
worked for them

494
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,359
and everyone now has to deal with that

495
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,959
unless you have a billion euro budget

496
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,559
for litigation and you don't have to

497
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,679
deal with that

498
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,119
and they have now come up with a new

499
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,640
directive the

500
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,799
network information security directive

501
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,559
version 2 because the first one didn't

502
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,839
work

503
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,440
where they want to say look these are

504
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,760
vital bits of the internet or vital bits

505
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,400
of the society and we want to regulate

506
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,360
you on how you deal with getting hacked

507
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
or how you deal with going down or

508
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,720
whatever so that you report that and in

509
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,799
theory it all it's all full of nice

510
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,799
ideas and it's of course good to to

511
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,559
report and responsible disclosure and

512
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,039
that kind of stuff but they have also

513
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,720
attempted to regulate the entire

514
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,400
internet with that because they said the

515
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,080
root servers of the internet are so

516
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,200
important

517
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,720
that uh yeah they fall under this

518
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,400
legislation and you must report any

519
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,320
downtime and incidents

520
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,880
to your local eu representative and if

521
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,720
you are not in the eu you must pick a

522
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,559
representative in the eu and report it

523
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,440
there

524
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
and this is not a very good idea and

525
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,520
together with the ripe ncc and isc

526
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,200
i and other people have been working on

527
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,960
trying to talk sense in the european

528
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,120
union and the european parliament has

529
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,520
now decided to put the root servers out

530
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,600
of scope which is really nice

531
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,120
but it's not a done deal we're still

532
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,200
working on it

533
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,760
what else is going on

534
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,000
in your various european countries at

535
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,320
times domain names or ip addresses get

536
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,280
blocked

537
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,200
and this is usually after a very long

538
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,880
court battle because courts are not in

539
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,799
the habit of just blocking stuff because

540
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,799
you don't like it and so you have to

541
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,960
have exhausted all your other remedies

542
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,360
and then after several years of lawsuits

543
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,799
you often

544
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,960
succeed in getting a european court to

545
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,600
order isps to block access to certain

546
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,640
content

547
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,160
and this has typically not been very

548
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
successful because they block domain

549
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,240
names they sometimes block ip addresses

550
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
and the people that want to get access

551
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,760
to torrents they also can use a

552
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,919
different name server so they they

553
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,919
typically find a way around it one of

554
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,919
the more scarier things that is going on

555
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,080
that in germany the rights industry

556
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,919
scans the internet for people doing

557
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,000
torrenting or other file sharing then

558
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,919
they get a court order and then the isp

559
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,559
has to cough up the details of the ip

560
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,080
addresses they were found to be sharing

561
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,640
data and then you get a scary cease and

562
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,400
desist letter and it's a really scary

563
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,679
one in german

564
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,240
uh many things are scarier in german and

565
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,080
um and then you have to pay a thousand

566
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,400
euros or appeal whatever and it's quite

567
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,039
a scary thing and then it's uh yeah we

568
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,559
don't we don't have that in other

569
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,640
countries in europe but it's uh it's if

570
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,120
you're in germany this is apparently a

571
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
nasty letter to receive

572
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,440
so in general the european union loves

573
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,919
to regulate the internet

574
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,400
countries do come up with blocks from

575
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,919
time to time these are not very

576
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,280
effective but they do actually happen

577
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,480
now the united states of america

578
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,919
and i'm happy that i'm presenting this

579
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,520
to you

580
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,679
of course the us has a very powerful

581
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,320
first amendment so very often americans

582
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,640
will get really upset when they hear

583
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,640
that courts can order certain kinds of

584
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,240
content to be blocked in other countries

585
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,720
or in europe because the first amendment

586
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,559
and indeed the first amendment is an

587
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,919
exceptionally powerful piece of

588
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,280
legislation

589
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,440
and it has to be

590
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,720
because it's so important in

591
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,600
safeguarding your rights and freedoms

592
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,440
but is it all good

593
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,240
and

594
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,080
it turns out that there are quite a few

595
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,679
ways in which you can block content

596
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,919
without actually blocking content

597
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:38,799
so

598
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,480
all of the world has to deal with the

599
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,280
usdmca so everyone in the world gets

600
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,200
these dmca notifications and we have her

601
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,039
act on them because if we don't the

602
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,799
results are really bad

603
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,400
um the us has quite a big uh pull on the

604
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,919
world so

605
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,440
if the us doesn't like what you are

606
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,280
doing you get kicked out of payment

607
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,919
systems so you can you have freedom to

608
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,200
say what you want you just don't have

609
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
freedom to get paid for it

610
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,480
and then there is the

611
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,320
national security legislation from the

612
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,840
u.s which is

613
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,280
frighteningly

614
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,360
scary and powerful

615
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,200
and let me explain a little bit how it

616
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,080
works

617
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,480
i am not from the us i have i have not

618
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,720
been to the us for 10 years

619
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,480
still i have to sign these pieces of

620
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,120
paper with my bank periodically to prove

621
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,760
to them that i have no u.s interests

622
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,760
because they are so afraid that they

623
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,120
will ever get

624
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,520
some kind of u.s sanctions issue with me

625
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,840
or with everyone that runs a big company

626
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,360
that they want to have a piece of paper

627
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,600
on file that proves that i am not

628
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
substantially an american or a u.s

629
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,159
person or am there a lot so the whole

630
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,480
world is sort of afraid of the us

631
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,240
national security legislation which is

632
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,520
can be good or bad but

633
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,400
it is in any case fair to say that this

634
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,240
has a big influence on how people use

635
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,080
the internet um

636
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,600
the other thing that's interesting is

637
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,200
that even though the first amendment

638
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
rights are really good in the us and i'm

639
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
jealous of them i have to admit i wish i

640
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,600
had a first amendment

641
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,440
but it turns out it's surprisingly easy

642
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,760
in the u.s to impound a domain name so

643
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,360
that means that i have a domain name the

644
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,679
us doesn't like it and suddenly my

645
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,840
website is replaced by this and this

646
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,120
happened to a

647
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,080
vpn provider that somehow got the law

648
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,600
enforcement upset

649
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,480
and there was a dot-com name and

650
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,240
apparently the us department of justice

651
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,280
can show up at fairysign or registrar or

652
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,960
dot-com operator and

653
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,679
impound a domain name and replace it

654
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,760
with this this police artwork that

655
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,520
proudly says that your domain has been

656
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,880
taken down

657
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,559
and of course

658
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,159
such things are nice

659
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,520
when you are

660
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,280
happy with such decisions when you think

661
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,679
hey it's nice they took down this this

662
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,280
site full of

663
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,440
drug trades or arms trades and that's of

664
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,400
course pretty good stuff

665
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,039
is sort of frightening from the world's

666
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,480
perspective

667
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,280
that uh the us can impound dot-com

668
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,520
domain names and they recently did that

669
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,840
for presstv.com which is an iranian

670
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,440
propaganda site

671
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,799
and um

672
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,679
yeah it is i mean it's of course i i i'm

673
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,000
also not in favor of iranian propaganda

674
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,480
but it's for the world at large it's a

675
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,440
bit worrying that dot-com domains can

676
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,159
simply be um impounded

677
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,440
so

678
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,840
even though i i much respect the u.s

679
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,440
first amendment

680
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,919
it is not fair to say that the internet

681
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,760
in america is completely free because

682
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,240
there are many ways in which you can

683
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,720
still be taken offline even though you

684
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,720
have still a lot of right of free speech

685
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,159
now

686
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,880
this has been a sort of an array of

687
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,200
what governments are up to and how they

688
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,360
are blocking the internet

689
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,200
on the other side we have of course the

690
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,080
big technology companies and uh they are

691
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,320
sort of yeah literally on the other side

692
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,960
they want to share information and

693
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,880
and they typically also make big noises

694
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,679
about keeping your information safe from

695
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,600
governments with by using strong

696
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,360
encryption for example

697
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,480
and that's good by the way

698
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,559
but

699
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,039
these companies have become so big and i

700
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,640
know there's a lot of debate about that

701
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,559
and i don't want to enter into

702
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,279
section 230 stories which are so

703
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,200
important in the us that we even even

704
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,799
hear them here in europe

705
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,360
um so i just want to diagnose what is

706
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,640
going on

707
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,159
um

708
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,240
if you have ever been on the naughty

709
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,120
list of google youtube facebook or

710
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,520
microsoft so they have decided that your

711
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,480
content is bad for some reason maybe

712
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,320
they found malware on your site maybe

713
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,240
there was a complaint about your site or

714
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,520
whatever

715
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,440
all these companies you run private

716
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,039
tribunals

717
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:51,840
and

718
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,679
in these tribunals

719
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,320
they decide that your site is no longer

720
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,799
safe and no one should be visiting it or

721
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,080
your site should disappear from view

722
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,880
or

723
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,559
your site is no longer allowed to make

724
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,880
money or in the case of microsoft

725
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,960
specifically your site is no longer

726
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,039
allowed to send email

727
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,960
these are decisions that are

728
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,279
taken much like

729
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,159
authority authoritarian governments

730
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,960
these decisions are very arbitrary

731
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,679
and you cannot appeal them so if if one

732
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,360
of these companies decides that your

733
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,039
content is somehow illegal or whatever

734
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,520
you get maybe you get noticed maybe you

735
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,039
get a notification that's not even

736
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,400
always the case

737
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,360
um

738
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,880
but if you're unhappy with the decision

739
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,200
that your content was illegal uh you

740
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
cannot go you cannot appeal you cannot

741
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,039
go to a higher court

742
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,520
and and go to the google supreme court

743
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,080
or whatever and argue your case again

744
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,600
quite often there is only a button that

745
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,440
says i am not happy with this decision

746
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,559
and can you review it and but sometimes

747
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,120
they even use words like like appeal and

748
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,039
verdict so it even sounds a bit like a

749
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,080
chord

750
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,400
but these tribunals are very arbitrary

751
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,559
so we don't know how they work

752
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,480
uh we don't know what procedures they

753
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,679
run by is there a chord is there a court

754
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,440
of first instance

755
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,400
can i yeah is there even an appeal

756
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,720
and also quite often the first thing you

757
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,480
notice that that someone has an issue

758
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,679
with your content is the fact that you

759
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,360
can no longer log in

760
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,919
so suddenly everything is gone and there

761
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,000
have been cases where people for example

762
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,400
got their google account blocked so they

763
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,480
couldn't log into their email anymore

764
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,159
and they were no longer able to

765
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,720
communicate about their case

766
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,600
and these consequences are very dire so

767
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,159
a friend of mine con colifas he's a

768
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,000
linux kernel developer an

769
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,600
anesthesiologist

770
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,360
and he also developed a tool called

771
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,080
llrzip long range zip which is used in

772
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,559
biology and it's sadly also used by

773
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,960
malware authors for some reason

774
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,720
and at some point google safe browsing

775
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,440
decided that long range zip was a scary

776
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,720
piece of technology and it should be

777
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,240
delisted

778
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,679
and it was gone

779
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,919
the page no one with any browser could

780
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,000
visit his page anymore because even

781
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,919
non-google browsers run checks with

782
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,080
google safe browsing and google safe

783
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,919
browsing had decided that his page was

784
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,080
no longer safe so no one could visit it

785
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,120
anymore

786
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,200
and i got involved with that and we

787
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
tried to get an appeal going on we try

788
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,440
to get someone to review and it turns

789
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,600
out that these processes on what gets

790
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,679
delisted are so arbitrary that even if

791
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,080
you know lots of people over at google

792
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,520
it just happens

793
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,080
and it took years to resolve this

794
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,279
situation

795
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,200
so this is actually sort of quite

796
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,320
authoritarian government behavior

797
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,760
and there's a term for this it's called

798
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,679
the kangaroo court and has been around

799
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,240
for a while where companies or sports

800
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,640
clips or whatever ruin their own sort of

801
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,559
legal systems and make their own ad hoc

802
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,960
decisions without actually being formal

803
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,320
courts and this has

804
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,600
historically been a very bad thing

805
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,799
um

806
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,480
then you of course have to realize that

807
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,799
the world is bigger than europe and the

808
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,360
us and other places it's

809
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,039
even if there is a way to appeal um

810
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,120
that way may not be as open in all

811
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,600
countries around the world so for

812
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,240
example the news from from last week was

813
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,720
that facebook had apparently struck a

814
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,640
deal with the vietnamese government

815
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,320
where they said look this content this

816
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,840
this opposition content it's

817
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,000
anti-government and uh we're gonna

818
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,440
assist the vietnamese government in

819
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,000
blocking that and it's interesting i

820
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,919
mean facebook is a private company they

821
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,399
can do as much as they want apparently

822
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,279
but the access to appeal or to be

823
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,679
unhappy with that is of course a lot

824
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,679
better from the us or even from europe

825
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,600
than it is from vietnam

826
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,520
and the people in vietnam really did not

827
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,440
have a lot of choice in this so

828
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,000
this is again a case where such a

829
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,159
internal decision made by a big company

830
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,799
on what is good and what is not good um

831
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,840
can be have a very big consequences

832
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,440
um this is another one that's

833
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,600
interesting it's a sort of nearly secret

834
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,159
facebook project facebook basics

835
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,520
and

836
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,440
this is a project to get one billion

837
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,399
people online on facebook's terms

838
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,640
and they've invested in this in a big

839
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,440
way

840
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,919
and they have not spoken a lot about

841
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,760
this but they have sort of exported a

842
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,679
free version of the internet to all the

843
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,399
blue countries on this map in africa

844
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,559
and if you try to find out how that

845
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,440
works then you only find

846
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,440
information for developers how you can

847
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,600
become part of the facebook basics

848
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,279
program which means that people in

849
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,600
africa can access your content for free

850
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,000
but no one knows who gets on this

851
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,159
internet who gets not on this internet

852
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,080
who picks who gets to be on it can the

853
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,279
opposition

854
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,240
and the party also be on it no one knows

855
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,039
so

856
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,960
these are again sort of government-like

857
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,880
decisions government-like activities and

858
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,360
we have no idea what's going on

859
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,320
so

860
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,799
um so we we now know that these big

861
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,039
companies run their own tribunals so it

862
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,640
would be nice if we could see what they

863
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,919
were doing

864
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,399
and uh i have a lot of beef uh with this

865
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,919
one um

866
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,760
if you try to find out what a modern

867
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,799
phone

868
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,279
or a modern browser is doing

869
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,440
it will not tell you

870
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,399
so

871
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,559
we may know or remember from the past

872
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,840
that you can

873
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,559
insert certificates and run a proxy

874
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,320
server and inspect what comes out of a

875
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,600
browser this is no longer true

876
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,399
if you have a modern phone you can not

877
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,039
run a proxy service through it to figure

878
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,679
out what your phone is sharing with the

879
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,039
world about you it is impossible

880
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,279
and there was a paper from a university

881
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,080
in dublin two weeks ago where they made

882
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,559
valiant attempts to figure out what

883
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,960
android apps are actually sending to

884
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,240
their mother ship

885
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,320
and they had to root their phone reverse

886
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,720
engineer it replace certificates and

887
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,799
they were able to partially figure out

888
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,880
what the apps were doing but they even

889
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,480
found out that once they had stripped

890
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,440
the tls layer that the data that was

891
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,880
being sort of snitched on the users was

892
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,840
super encrypted using an obfuscated aes

893
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,799
key

894
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,200
and these dublin researchers were unable

895
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,279
to figure out what the phone was

896
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,440
actually sending to the mothership about

897
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,519
you the owner

898
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,039
and

899
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,120
this is being sold as zero trust and as

900
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,440
better for everyone because the the

901
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,480
story here is is that privacy is means

902
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,559
that the data is a well-kept secret

903
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,760
between you

904
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,559
and google or you and apple and no one

905
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,399
else should be able to see it

906
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,559
not even you apparently

907
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,279
so the phone has its own enclave where

908
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,679
it sends information about you to the

909
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,360
cloud and it's not

910
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,519
going to tell you what it is sending for

911
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,360
your own good

912
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,320
and

913
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,960
this leads to the harsh choice that if

914
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,640
you have a device on your network a

915
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,679
modern

916
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,159
phone or a modern browser or a modern

917
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,000
chromebook even

918
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,840
you have to give it an

919
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,159
access to the internet uninspectable

920
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,159
access to the internet because the

921
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,480
moment you try to figure out what is my

922
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,440
phone uh telling about me 2d it's yeah

923
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,919
it's it's creator then the phone shuts

924
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:12,720
down

925
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,120
it will not allow you to do that

926
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,399
and

927
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,880
that means that all control

928
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,039
is now with the operators of phones or

929
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,200
the creators of phones and browsers

930
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,600
which is pretty sad news for network

931
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,679
operators and potentially evil

932
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,279
governments and i mean it's not all bad

933
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,159
but

934
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,440
it is a combination that is worrying

935
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,480
behind this is an idea that if we make

936
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,799
information so well encrypted that no

937
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,960
one can decrypt it that this will allow

938
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,840
for perfect freedom around the world

939
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,799
and it might just be as explained in

940
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,640
this xkcd comic that things do not quite

941
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,679
work out

942
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,440
like that

943
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,960
um

944
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,279
so let's say you are russia

945
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,880
or you are

946
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,480
indonesia or turkey and i mean it's nice

947
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,600
that it's getting far harder to censor

948
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,559
modern funds it is nice i mean it's good

949
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,880
it's a raising the bar exercise i'm very

950
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,960
informed very fond of end-to-end

951
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,200
encryption and i love privacy

952
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,399
but the idea that we will then

953
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,120
be giving safety to people

954
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,039
accessing content that their government

955
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,320
doesn't like

956
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,399
i'm not sure how that works because

957
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,039
every webpage i visit is full of

958
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,320
trackers that that store exactly where i

959
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,919
go and what sites i visit and what my uh

960
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,000
latitude and longitude is and my my

961
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,399
location and what apps i have installed

962
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,279
on my phone i'm not entirely sure if

963
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,600
encrypting all the data is actually

964
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,120
going to protect

965
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,360
people because there's so much data

966
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,799
being collected

967
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,240
i am not sure that all parties

968
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,240
collecting that data will actually keep

969
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,760
it secret from these these evil

970
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,559
governments and we have now also seen

971
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,799
that for example in russia

972
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:05,120
phones must now be sold with mandatory

973
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,559
government apps

974
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,079
and

975
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,159
the famous phone manufacturers

976
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,399
apparently put these apps now on these

977
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,839
funds and

978
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,000
and and i'm sure they're it's very

979
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,679
difficult for them to

980
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,000
balance what they do and they probably

981
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,839
try to keep a real good eye on these

982
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,079
apps if they're not snitching or

983
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,280
endangering their users but um

984
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,879
it is nice that there is now end-to-end

985
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,800
encryption but i'm not sure

986
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,960
if this will actually deliver

987
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,639
a super secure

988
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,560
experience for everyone

989
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,599
and the end result may be that

990
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,960
governments say look you made it

991
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,280
impossible for us to intercept traffic

992
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,119
on the network fine we're going to

993
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,719
intercept traffic straight in the

994
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,560
browser so if you want to use the

995
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,639
internet we'll have this hosted browser

996
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,239
for you and you can use this hosted

997
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,320
browser as much as you want

998
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,159
because we've modified this browser that

999
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,839
it keeps exact track of what you're

1000
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,359
doing like they're doing in north korea

1001
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,400
right now

1002
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,359
and

1003
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,680
and this brings a whole new set of

1004
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,280
choices eventually

1005
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,359
so i i have not spoken a lot about apple

1006
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,960
and microsoft and i've promised i would

1007
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,800
upset everyone in this presentation so i

1008
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,640
still have a little bit of work to do

1009
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,960
and um i personally have been doing

1010
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,359
battle with microsoft for for many years

1011
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,200
because and whenever i try to send email

1012
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,160
to them

1013
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,000
i would end up in the spam folder so i

1014
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,079
could not effectively for myself hosted

1015
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,640
email communicate with people using

1016
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,440
live.com or hotmail.com and this went on

1017
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,200
for years and this became sort of my

1018
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,000
personal quest to see what can i do

1019
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,480
to solve this so i did everything i did

1020
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,040
the dmarc i did the spf

1021
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,440
i logged on to the microsoft ip

1022
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,680
reputation program i signed contracts

1023
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,079
with them and nothing worked and for

1024
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,880
many years i could not send email

1025
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,200
to live.com users or hotmail.com users

1026
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,400
but i could send email to office 365

1027
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,079
users because they apparently get better

1028
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:58,320
spam filters but again there was no way

1029
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,720
to appeal i could not talk to microsoft

1030
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,480
informally i could talk to microsoft

1031
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,880
because i know a lot of people

1032
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,480
and i have a lot of contacts but even

1033
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,800
then i could not move the needle there i

1034
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,960
could not talk to microsoft because

1035
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,359
microsoft had decided that i am no

1036
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,839
longer not worthy to send email to their

1037
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:16,960
customers

1038
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,599
um apple meanwhile

1039
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,440
and they they dress it up very well and

1040
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,000
it's very pretty but if you want to

1041
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,560
operate in the apple ecosystem they

1042
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,960
control how you breathe and everything

1043
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,839
has to be exactly like how they do it

1044
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,280
and they have this big fight for our

1045
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,960
privacy going on which is i mean i

1046
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,520
appreciate it i love it but the end

1047
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,560
result somehow is that they tripled

1048
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,400
their advertising revenue over the past

1049
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,760
quarter or something like that because

1050
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,839
they they sort of outlawed lots of other

1051
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,400
people's uh advertising programs and now

1052
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,760
suddenly everyone has to use their

1053
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,480
advertising program so this is again

1054
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,119
someone trying to control the internet

1055
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,599
and similarly we all know the epic story

1056
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,119
basically if you want to sell something

1057
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,800
on an apple device

1058
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,880
apple would really like to get their cut

1059
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,599
if you use their technology or not

1060
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,440
so also no love for the apple and

1061
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,720
microsoft

1062
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,640
so summarizing

1063
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,880
who actually controls the internet well

1064
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,200
we have a bunch of governments and

1065
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,599
they make pretty ham-fisted attempts to

1066
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,280
control the internet

1067
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,359
and it's not not very effective in many

1068
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,839
countries

1069
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,599
but at least it goes through appeals at

1070
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,280
least there are courts there are

1071
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,760
lawsuits there is due process it's not

1072
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,880
easy

1073
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,000
for a

1074
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,119
non-authoritarian government to block

1075
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,640
content online they have to go through

1076
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,320
all kinds of motions and it's a very

1077
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,839
visible thing

1078
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,400
um maybe some good news all these

1079
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,119
efforts to encrypt even more ever more

1080
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,560
of the internet

1081
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,040
do mean that less sophisticated or less

1082
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,640
independent governments have an ever

1083
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,040
harder time controlling the internet so

1084
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,760
let us count that as a win

1085
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,440
meanwhile we have these big technology

1086
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,359
firms that control the hardware the

1087
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,440
software and they run their own kangaroo

1088
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,920
cords that decide who wins and who loses

1089
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,640
and there's no way to appeal that or to

1090
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,280
have any insights in what they are doing

1091
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,960
because they are encrypting what they

1092
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,880
are doing and hiding it from the end

1093
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,280
users and moving more and more stuff to

1094
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,200
their control points which means that

1095
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,359
they won they have these kangaroo courts

1096
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,200
and two they are moving more and more

1097
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,240
control

1098
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,520
to these kangaroo courts

1099
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,599
much as we love to hate on incompetent

1100
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:33,520
governments that just don't get it and

1101
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
and i work for one so i'm well aware of

1102
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,760
how they don't get it

1103
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,000
stuff like due process is actually

1104
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,079
rather nice it is pretty good that if

1105
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:43,280
someone wants to kick you off the

1106
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,520
internet that there has to be some kind

1107
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,760
of process for that and that you can

1108
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,680
appeal and that there are standards of

1109
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,359
evidence that actually

1110
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,880
it was a nice thing people fought

1111
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,200
centuries to get that and then we moved

1112
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,480
to the internet and we said well we no

1113
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,000
longer need that we can just kick people

1114
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,680
off the internet using an

1115
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,000
i mean an invisible mechanism that no

1116
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,680
one knows how it works

1117
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,760
because and this is worrying because as

1118
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,760
it stands more and more control of the

1119
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,800
internet

1120
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
is shifting to these unaccountable mega

1121
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,680
firms

1122
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,720
and personally that worries me and i

1123
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,880
think with that we can say that who

1124
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,520
controls the internet well ever more of

1125
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,400
it is controlled by big opaque in

1126
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,480
transparent companies

1127
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,359
so is there any hope

1128
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,280
there are no easy solutions

1129
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,760
privacy is good encryption is good

1130
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,599
end-to-end encryption is good making

1131
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,079
information freely available is good

1132
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,240
but neither governments or companies are

1133
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,720
protecting these interests well enough

1134
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,599
right now and maybe the one thing we

1135
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,160
could concretely demand is that players

1136
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,800
with such significant market power

1137
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,720
do better than the current kangaroo

1138
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,200
courts that they are running right now

1139
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,240
because due process really is a lovely

1140
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,280
thing

1141
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,960
especially if there are decisions that

1142
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,520
can just lock you out of your life

1143
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,920
or ruin your company

1144
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,160
with that we have reached the end of my

1145
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,839
presentation

1146
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,560
but i will be around afterwards for a q

1147
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,280
a

1148
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,040
um so i'm happy to answer any of your

1149
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,599
questions there and if not then please

1150
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,000
feel free to send me an email or find me

1151
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,200
on twitter

1152
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,560
because i'd love to hear your thoughts

1153
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,720
and to make sure that i really upset

1154
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,839
everyone thank you

1155
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,000
all right um start with uh front

1156
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
microphone

1157
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,200
hi patrick gilmore d page realty

1158
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,040
thank you bert that was much scarier

1159
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,400
than anything i saw on halloween

1160
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,240
question

1161
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,200
i'm not

1162
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,960
going to argue whether

1163
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,880
any of these companies have control of

1164
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,240
the entire internet or something like

1165
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,040
that

1166
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,960
but you seem to be suggesting that they

1167
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
should not have unilateral decision

1168
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,359
making especially opaque decision making

1169
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,880
authority to kick somebody quote unquote

1170
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,480
off the internet the question now

1171
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,440
becomes

1172
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,720
when is somebody big enough to require i

1173
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,000
don't know government intervention or

1174
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,040
whatever you propose is the fix to this

1175
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
so for instance mr trump is creating

1176
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,040
truth social i'm sure it'll have dozens

1177
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,119
of users in a year now

1178
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,960
and at that point

1179
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,839
should they have to go through a

1180
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,119
government agency if they want to kick

1181
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,720
somebody off or do they have to wait

1182
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,400
till they have as many as twitter or as

1183
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,880
facebook

1184
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,720
it's a very good question and you see

1185
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,800
that in the european union

1186
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,240
they also struggle with that with the

1187
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,119
network information security directive

1188
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,400
where at first they said yeah it only

1189
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,560
applies to like a super systemic

1190
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,319
suppliers of services and then everyone

1191
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,400
said yeah but i'm definitely not a super

1192
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,079
systemic supplier so

1193
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,200
that it's not me and uh so they're also

1194
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,720
struggling with that and i would love to

1195
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,640
give a decent answer for it and i think

1196
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,640
we obviously know a few parties that

1197
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,319
would definitely fall under this

1198
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,119
umbrella so if if facebook kicks you out

1199
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:57,040
of whatsapp or meta kicks you out of

1200
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,359
whatsapp then then you are in deep deep

1201
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:00,880
prone

1202
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,560
so sadly i do not have a clear-cut

1203
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,640
answer but i i do have the diagnosis

1204
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,560
that what we have is not good

1205
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,760
and that the solution is not obvious um

1206
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,560
is

1207
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,640
completely true but i i should not stop

1208
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,800
us from

1209
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,200
seeing the problem and then maybe

1210
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,960
finding solutions for it

1211
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,920
uh

1212
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,760
again i'm not going to argue whether

1213
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,800
um

1214
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,400
whether there should be a solution here

1215
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,680
but i would like to point out that you

1216
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,040
say if you're kicked off whatsapp then

1217
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,839
you're in deep

1218
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,079
whatever there are literally

1219
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:33,520
billions of people who don't use

1220
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,040
whatsapp

1221
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,359
probably don't know it exists

1222
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,160
um

1223
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,760
if you are a whatsapp user and all your

1224
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,040
friends are whatsapp and you get kicked

1225
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,200
off whatsapp it's bad for you

1226
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,720
if you went to whatsapp to talk to one

1227
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,400
person and all your friends are on

1228
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,720
wechat or on messenger then i guess

1229
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,160
messenger is a bad example but you know

1230
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,880
what i mean it may or may not be bad so

1231
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,400
is

1232
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,720
i just worry about us putting in some

1233
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,200
type especially multinational

1234
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,560
type

1235
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,720
regulation over something that may or

1236
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,040
may not matter to certain people

1237
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,359
yeah so so maybe let me clarify that a

1238
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,960
bit in large parts of the world

1239
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,400
significant fractions of the whole

1240
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,640
economy run through whatsapp so it's not

1241
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,079
just people sending funny pictures to

1242
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,200
each other

1243
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,640
it's them coordinating their whole

1244
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,079
company so

1245
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,920
i i do understand it's a difficult thing

1246
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,599
but it's not the with the case with

1247
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,160
networks as you're probably well aware

1248
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,319
is that the power or the value of

1249
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:27,760
networks go up with the square of the

1250
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,920
number of people on there and there

1251
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,440
comes a point where you say look this

1252
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,880
this stuff is like so important you

1253
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,680
could just just execute a company if you

1254
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,119
kick them out of this

1255
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,960
and and you cannot say well i'll just

1256
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,440
shift everyone to this other network and

1257
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,200
this is not a i mean if this were easy

1258
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,680
we would not be in this situation

1259
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,640
okay thank you

1260
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,800
all right thank you

1261
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,880
we have one question from the remote q a

1262
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,760
uh this is from anita m

1263
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,560
bert how do we get average users to care

1264
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,440
about these issues and press for change

1265
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,440
yeah no one cares about this until it

1266
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,720
happens to them

1267
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,280
so many of you in the room in in and

1268
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,960
around the world will now be well this

1269
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,319
never happened to me

1270
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,319
and the thing is you have to experience

1271
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,319
this to know what it feels like so you

1272
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,000
turn on the website and you cannot log

1273
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,720
in

1274
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,400
or your customers just say well your

1275
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,560
website disappeared or

1276
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,079
like happened with me

1277
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,800
i could no longer email my customers and

1278
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,640
then you do care

1279
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,359
deeply and um i think that the the

1280
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,200
operators of many of these filtering

1281
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,440
networks are sort of well aware of this

1282
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,960
so for example i mentioned the example

1283
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,520
of google safe browsing and i think

1284
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,520
almost no one is aware that all your

1285
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,680
website accesses are being

1286
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,440
protected through google safe browsing

1287
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,520
because they usually do a really good

1288
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,680
job in only filtering out the nasty

1289
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,880
stuff and

1290
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,960
uh and only very rarely do they

1291
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,000
inadvertently uh kill a computer program

1292
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,680
like what happened with my friend con

1293
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,800
colifos

1294
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,599
um

1295
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,680
so in general the only way that people

1296
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,520
really care is once it has happened to

1297
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,280
them and i think there are now large

1298
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,800
groups of the population that have seen

1299
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,760
it happen

1300
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,160
uh they have seen their their facebook

1301
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,800
group disappear arbitrarily and other

1302
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,079
groups not disappear arbitrarily and

1303
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,000
that might give people an inkling that

1304
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,400
this is going on but uh but in general

1305
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,839
these things are very you can talk about

1306
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,240
this a lot and you will only feel it uh

1307
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,800
once your own once your own company or

1308
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,880
content or group has just disappeared on

1309
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,079
you

1310
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,040
okay

1311
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,440
thank you uh one more question from

1312
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,599
remote uh unfortunately we have this

1313
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,720
this is going to have to be our last

1314
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,040
question for time reasons uh this is

1315
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,800
from matthew pitak

1316
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,680
uh would treaty based organizations like

1317
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,160
the itu be an appropriate place for

1318
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,119
governance and control of the internet

1319
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,319
to ultimately reside rather than the big

1320
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,319
tech companies

1321
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,480
no that would of course be terrible

1322
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,880
terrible terrible to do it that way

1323
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,040
and uh because as lots of people know

1324
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,400
there are all kinds of governments that

1325
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,400
are trying to control the itu

1326
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,640
and use the itu as some kind of place to

1327
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:07,359
to

1328
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,319
yeah

1329
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,560
create conditions that are favorable for

1330
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,760
them

1331
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,160
i think this will very much

1332
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,319
intrinsically be a

1333
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,920
national affair

1334
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,319
uh where many countries will have to

1335
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,920
impose their own kind of regulation

1336
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,160
because it does not do me a lot of good

1337
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,880
if i'm in vietnam and and there is a

1338
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,800
tribunal somewhere in geneva that can

1339
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,000
help me

1340
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,839
and that's not likely going to be a real

1341
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,079
good solution

1342
