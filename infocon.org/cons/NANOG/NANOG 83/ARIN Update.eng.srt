going to talk about a few things fee

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,320
harmonization premier support plan

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,879
template irr decommissioning

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,399
our rir and rpki updates and some new

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,039
functionality in aaron online go next

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,559
slide

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,840
so this is the big change

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,760
basically address blocks for address

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,520
blocks and we're using them

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,799
everyone's using them the same way

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,080
regardless of how they got issued

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,840
whether you're issued as an end user

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,040
directly from aaron or whether you're

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,640
issued as an isp

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,799
people are using them routing them

37
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,040
transferring them and we provide

38
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,439
basically the same services for the same

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,520
blocks some people may use them some

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,040
people may not but we do provide the

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,640
same services we don't want to tell

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,240
someone your block doesn't you know

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,920
we're not going to provide you the

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,360
ability to use a service because you're

45
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,640
an end user

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,200
so we decided to make the fees the same

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,000
so starting in january everyone pays the

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,200
same fee

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,799
it's a schedule based on the total

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,600
holdings your total ipv4 or your total

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,399
ipv6 whatever the high water mark is

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,320
that your fee category and this is the

53
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,720
fee schedule that the isps have been

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,159
paying for years okay it starts at 250

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,840
and every time your address space goes

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,200
up by four

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,920
if it's ipv4 your your feed doubles so

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,680
it's 250 500 1 000 248 all the way up to

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,239
the privileged people who get to pay 128

60
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,400
or 256 000 a year but it starts low so

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,760
that's not you

62
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,879
so we have 8 000 members who are isps

63
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,440
they're all paying this fee schedule

64
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,480
we have about 7 000 organizations that

65
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,800
are end users who are moving to this fee

66
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,720
schedule so everyone's going to pay the

67
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,599
same get the same services

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,360
we're also changing the transfer fee

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,800
because you'd be amazed how much work

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,680
there is handling some of the transfers

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,319
we did a community consultation

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,319
because of that we did make some changes

73
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,800
we lowered fees for org create and org

74
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,319
recovery

75
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,000
and this is

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,760
basically to get everyone on parity

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,000
that's why we're doing it starts january

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,640
1st if you have a couple of objects in

79
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,879
the database in the iron registry you're

80
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,879
paying 150 an object and a couple of

81
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,720
them you're not going to notice uh you

82
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,640
know if you have a couple of large

83
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,680
objects like a slash 16 or a slash 8

84
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,400
this definitely affects you so for most

85
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
people though who have address blocks in

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,480
the 20 to 24 range your fees are going

87
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,599
to be

88
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,360
comparable you might be

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,440
600 instead of 250

90
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,720
some people it's the other way around a

91
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,840
lot of people are 300 going down to 250.

92
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,360
some people are paying more depends on

93
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,440
your address block but instead of number

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,280
of objects if you're an end user

95
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,599
organization the end user is now paying

96
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,840
on total size just like everyone else

97
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,440
next slide

98
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,280
period support plan

99
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
for the people who are paying

100
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,760
people have very large uh address space

101
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,680
with aaron we have a premier support

102
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,120
plan if your 2x or larger fee category

103
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,640
have a dedicated analyst who knows all

104
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,560
your tickets you have priority support

105
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,799
queue you have direct technical services

106
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,560
liaison who can work with engineering to

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,360
work out your issues um you have on-call

108
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,599
support if you're working on something

109
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,959
and you can't get it to work and it's

110
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,120
the weekend yes you can call us we

111
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,360
monitor and keep the systems up 24x7

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,720
365. but this is if you need help with

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,799
us using our services or need help with

114
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,560
a ticket status you actually have a way

115
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,480
to reach someone on the weekend so this

116
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,239
is for the very large customers if

117
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,920
you're paying us thirty two thousand

118
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,238
dollars a year or more you get a little

119
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,798
more but uh i don't feel bad about that

120
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,759
given the uh fees involved uh we're

121
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,199
thinking of making this optional for

122
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,400
people who want it there are some

123
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,080
companies who have smaller address

124
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
holdings who could benefit but still

125
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,440
working on that

126
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,759
we'll have ideas on that next quarter

127
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,479
next next slide

128
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,520
i'm not going to talk about this at

129
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,880
length because brad's going to cover it

130
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,440
right after me but suffice to say that

131
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,680
we're getting rid of template irrs the

132
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,639
non-authenticated non-authenticated

133
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,360
irr database it's going away

134
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
you folks said give most more time so we

135
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,600
pushed it out to 31 march but we are

136
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,120
getting rid of this

137
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,000
years and years of unauthenticated croft

138
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,720
go away next

139
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,800
um we have a bunch of features if you

140
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,080
want to actually do good irr and

141
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,639
rpki we've created restful interfaces so

142
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,560
you can go in and directly interface

143
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
your systems the aaron ones

144
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,360
we've added our psl display to the aaron

145
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
online interface

146
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,680
we created some training programs

147
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,000
next

148
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,000
we change our password practices some of

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,880
you were getting locked out of your

150
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,720
accounts whether you didn't know how to

151
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,320
get in or other people were knocking at

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,479
your door we had a lockout that's not

153
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,080
nist recommended

154
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,520
we asked you what you wanted you said

155
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,039
nist 863 so you have nist 863 both in

156
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,880
password selection and dealing with uh

157
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,919
attacks on it back off and captures

158
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,400
uh training next

159
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,960
we have a bunch of on-demand webinars if

160
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,720
you're asking how to use something at

161
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,680
aaron and you want to get a real quick

162
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,400

163
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,720
getting to know the irr online our

164
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,039
restful apis for irr

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,639
enhancing your routing security using

166
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,800
hosted rpki and of course if you're

167
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,400
