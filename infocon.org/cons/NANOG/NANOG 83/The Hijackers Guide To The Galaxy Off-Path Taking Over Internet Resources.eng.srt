00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,680
hello everyone welcome to the

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,840
presentation my name is chen chiang bae

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,679
i'm a researcher from german national

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,120
research center for applied cyber

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,360
security athena and the founder

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,199
institute for secure information

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,000
technology sit in dumpster germany here

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,680
i am going to present our work at the

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,400
hijackers guide to the galaxy of us

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,960
talking over internet resources in this

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,800
talk i will briefly introduce what

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
digital resources are how they are

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,880
managed by providers and which providers

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,520
and customers are considered in our work

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,600
then we will have a look at how to take

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,520
over those customer cards to hijack

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,040
their resources

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,960
i will show how many customers and other

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,039
resources are vulnerable

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,039
as an example i will also present some

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,360
potential resource manipulations wasn't

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,239
called get helped in the end i will

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,800
propose a few cut measures and conclude

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,879
what are digital resources by saying

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,960
digital resources we mean the resources

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,440
you can only own digitally for example

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,640
domain name ip addresses cloud computing

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,240
server certificates

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,320
normally these resources cannot be

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,920
created on your own

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,000
to get these resources you need to go to

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,640
certain providers and purchase from them

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,640
typically you will have a contact

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,720
provider so that you can conveniently

36
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,400
manage your resources there

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
in our work we consider four types of

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,680
providers

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,479
regional internet registries iir for

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,520
short from whom you can buy ip addresses

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,280
for example irene and arrive

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,439
the main gestures for whom you can buy

43
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,520
domain names for example godaddy alibaba

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,159
cloud providers such as amazon aws and

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,079
microsoft azure

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,799
certificate authorities ca for short

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,560
where you can buy server certificate

48
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,360
such as tactical digi search we also

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,000
perform customer side measurements we

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,640
include the 75 percent of customers of

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,640
ios and alexa top 100 000 domains as our

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,079
customer database

53
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,560
how do you attack providers

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,399
we design the attacker by taking over

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,560
customer clouds from off paths via

56
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,160
password recovery

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,480
firstly the attacker does skin poisoning

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,920
to target the provider's thing as

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,840
resolver and tries to point the

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,160
customer's mail server to attack the

61
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,080
server then he triggers the password

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,480
recovery email for the customer account

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,720
as the provider stings reserver is

64
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,040
already present the provider will send

65
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,520
the email to attacker server thus the

66
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,599
attacker can reset the password and get

67
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,239
access to the account afterwards you can

68
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,640
log in and manipulate the resources we

69
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,879
evaluated three different types of past

70
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,800
tense category methods

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,440
one use uses bgp subpressed high

72
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,560
checking another one uses side channel

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,440
this method is also called certainness

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,160
last one uses ip fragmentation

75
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,319
we found that for bgp sub prefix

76
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,800
hijacking and ip fragmentation attacks

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,879
majority of the providers we tested are

78
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,239
vulnerable

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,800
while for the side channel attacks only

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,879
few providers are vulnerable on the

81
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,640
other side how many customers are

82
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,480
vulnerable to the attack for customers

83
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,560
to be vulnerable it has to

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,040
fulfill two properties first

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,879
the customer's logging information or

86
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,879
card details needs to be known by the

87
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,519
attacker there's a prerequisite to

88
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,680
trigger password recovery we find out

89
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,760
that for most providers you only need

90
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,159
the email address luckily or maybe

91
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,959
unlikely we have whois database it is

92
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,280
publicly available and contains conduct

93
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,840
information of many of the resources for

94
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,519
our customer data set

95
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,239
we can get contact emails for 75 percent

96
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,400
of the iss and 11 of the alexa domains

97
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,480
even if we can't find the information

98
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,159
who is we can still guess the cloud

99
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,360
sometimes

100
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,680
for example some use classical emails

101
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,879
such as admin ad company or webmaster

102
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,040
company the other property of a

103
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,879
vulnerable customer needs to prefer is

104
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,799
that the name server configuration of

105
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,640
the email domain meets the requirement

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,400
of specificating as cash poisoning

107
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,519
methods

108
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,080
we find that around fifty percent of the

109
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,840
customers are vulnerable to be

110
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,599
suppressed high checking

111
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,599
around ten percent are vulnerable to

112
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,680
side channel and around twenty 20 are

113
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,000
vulnerable to ip fragmentation

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,680
since so many customer accounts are

115
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,238
vulnerable so are their resources

116
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,079
by mapping those customer cards to

117
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,560
digital resources especially ipv4

118
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,639
addresses and domains

119
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,320
we get to know how many resources are

120
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,720
vulnerable even though earlier around 50

121
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,120
of the tested customers are vulnerable

122
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,560
they already put majority of the

123
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,080
resources in danger we find that 93 of

124
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,880
ipv4 addresses and the 65 percent of

125
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,280
domains are vulnerable it indicates that

126
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,720
larger customers are even more

127
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,639
vulnerable than smaller ones

128
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,280
regardless of the query numbers let's

129
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,680
see how an attacker can manipulate the

130
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,120
resources

131
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,960
we've taken out of air on the right as

132
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,400
an example

133
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,039
firstly the attacker can manipulate rpk

134
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,280
status he can modify route origin

135
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,039
announcements so that he can either

136
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,039
disrupt the propagation of bgp

137
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,240
announcements or expose an rpki

138
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,600
protected network to bgb hijacking

139
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,680
the attacker can also manipulate a rap

140
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,000
database or with database

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
this would allow him to impersonating ui

142
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,880
representatives or even affect network

143
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,840
connectivity as some bgp routers use

144
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,800
whois data for filtering another obvious

145
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
manipulation is account management

146
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
the attacker can create some new users

147
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,919
with admin rights so that he can still

148
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,479
have access even the account is claimed

149
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,680
back

150
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,600
you can modify contact data or

151
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,479
organization details these would block

152
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,240
physical contacts between the provider

153
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,600
and the customer

154
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,759
you can even terminate the membership

155
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,000
which will delete all the resources

156
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,240
lastly the attacker can possibly

157
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,639
transfer or resell the resources to a

158
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,919
third party

159
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,240
and make profit out of it as for other

160
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,560
types of providers the attacker can do

161
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,360
some resource specific manipulations too

162
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,479
for example

163
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,840
if you get access to your customer's

164
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,319
account over at ca you can easily revoke

165
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,000
current certificates and then reissue

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,080
some new ones

167
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,639
if he logs into a domain register you

168
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,319
can delegate the whole domain to

169
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,080
malicious enabling servers or resell the

170
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,039
domains for for profit how can we count

171
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,520
measure these tags we propose cut

172
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,960
measures into two categories first to

173
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,919
make it harder to take over accounts

174
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,800
account details should be better hidden

175
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
the system should be separated for high

176
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,720
probability accounts

177
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,319
captures and the dinner cycle will also

178
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,440
help

179
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,520
the other category is to make it harder

180
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,360
for manipulation

181
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,560
resources

182
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,960
two factor authentications and culture

183
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,440
notifications should always be activated

184
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,599
stricter cloud access restrictions can

185
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,720
help

186
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,080
besides

187
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,880
more manual reviews or longer waiting

188
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,840
time should also prevent some malicious

189
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,919
transactions as in conclusion

190
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,560
we find that resource databases are

191
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,960
poorly protected adversaries can take

192
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,599
over the accounts and manipulate them

193
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,280
we also show that attacks against the

194
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,199
chaos are

195
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,840
large practical

196
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,440
of the providers and customers are

197
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,840
vulnerable to certain office attacks

198
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
that's even much easier for on-pass

199
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,440
attackers

200
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,520
there are already card measures

201
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,440
but most of them are not enforced

202
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,880
obviously

203
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,400
higher security or stricter

204
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,639
authentication lowers usability which

205
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,720
may drive customers away if you are

206
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,639
interested in more details you may check

207
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,160
our paper published as a username

208
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,280
security 2021 this is a joint work with

209
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,599
philippe yetner dr hayashuman and the

210
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,840
professor michael wagner thank you so

211
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,080
much for attending questions are welcome

212
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,840
with the population that you studied you

213
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,000
had a number of countermeasures uh do

214
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,720
you have any sense of what a percentage

215
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,800
of the population employs counter

216
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,080
measures today like two-factor

217
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,080
authentication

218
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,240
not exactly but as we checked all the

219
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,400
providers so most most of them have the

220
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,840
option to

221
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,400
enable two to factor authentication but

222
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,720
most of them are not enabled by default

223
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,879
if i remember correctly only one or two

224
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,879
to enforce it involves everyone to use

225
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,960
it but most of others like

226
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,599
it's disabled by default so it's quality

227
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,800
make it more vulnerable

228
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,199
thank you

229
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,600
do we have any other questions

230
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,120
oh excellent so from uh blake willis

231
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,519
we have what vector are you suggesting

232
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,000
an attacker would use to gain access to

233
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,480
a ripe ncc lirs

234
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,040
access account

235
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,440
excuse me i missed the

236
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,800
beginning part

237
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,600
uh uh what attack vector would you

238
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,560
suggest uh someone would use to gain

239
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,959
access to a specific resource and the

240
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,720
specific resource is the ripe ncc lars

241
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,120
access account

242
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,440
okay i see the attack vector we

243
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,360
suggested in this paper

244
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,440
in this work is you're using a sketch

245
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,880
button to

246
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,519
to hijack the account

247
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,880
so

248
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,279
the way we we use we

249
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,000
we we measured is to using all of us in

250
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,920
exchange poisoning so

251
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
there are recently like three different

252
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,399
works about our busting sketch poisoning

253
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,560
so we measured them against the

254
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,320
representation

255
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,040
and the

256
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,640
one challenging part is to get the

257
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,120
customer card so if you if you can do

258
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,800
something like social engineering so

259
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,560
that makes it much easier if you can't

260
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,600
we can do like a more educated guess so

261
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,040
for example you can get the account

262
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,599
information from who is by who is the

263
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,480
by who is the ip address so you can

264
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,839
directly get the content technic technic

265
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,000
content so most

266
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,560
most of the time that is the account

267
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,720
used for the registration and you can

268
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,800
try try to do password recovery and

269
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,880
after the things get poisoning your you

270
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,120
can the attacker can receive the email

271
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,600
and access a success account

272
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,600
so that's what we try to try to do in

273
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,000
this work

274
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,440
thank you we have a question at the

275
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,480
microphone

276
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,880
hi my name's leo vergoda and polo sllc

277
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,240
um

278
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,519
you mentioned that if someone takes over

279
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,279
a rypncc

280
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,279
uh single sign-on account they can

281
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,519
transfer ip addresses or is numbers away

282
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,600
it was my understanding and i've never

283
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,160
used the transfer process myself

284
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,120
that they actually do out of band

285
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,279
validation of identity

286
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,040
is that not the case

287
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,200
or is this uh

288
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,760
yes that's true for to transfer the to

289
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,839
transfer the ip address you need to

290
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,600
provide some

291
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
documents some legal document to prove

292
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,519
like you actually own that and also

293
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,320
prove you are like

294
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,519
you can represent that

295
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,680
legal person

296
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,240
so but

297
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,399
does that mean the scale of the risk is

298
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,959
disruption to the use of the resources

299
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,040
rather than the theft of the resources

300
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,680
permanently

301
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,880
yes it depends it depends on how

302
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,000
serious the check is is conducted

303
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,920
so because for example some sometimes

304
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,399
they only check the scanned version so

305
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,639
that can be

306
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,440
that can be easily manipulated

307
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,760
but if they really do the

308
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,000
do the check in person that would be

309
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
hard

310
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,399
thank you very much

311
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,440
thank you and we have a similar question

312
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,519
in the chat uh this is from andrew

313
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,880
william smith

314
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,000
uh and he's asking to create or modify

315
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,120
roas uh at least within aaron's using

316
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,200
hosted rpki

317
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,040
wouldn't the attacker also need to

318
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,760
access uh to the organization's private

319
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,839
key in order to sign the roas

320
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,000
uh yes you want if you want to recite

321
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,480
besides you can do it you need to but if

322
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,399
you want to just to revoke the things or

323
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,200
just just deleted the stuff it doesn't

324
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,720
you don't need to access the private

325
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,720
keywords

326
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,800
okay thank you

327
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,600
um

328
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,279
do we have any other questions

329
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,439
okay well thank you very much tian

330
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,160
yeah thank you

331
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,659
