[Music]

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,960
um i just like to say thanks to nena

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,800
committee for giving me this the

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,120
opportunity to speak about ipods at this

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,719
event

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,600
so today i will talk about ipod system

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,039
overview particularly focused on

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,760
ipods open then i will talk about state

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,720
local adoption and usage of ipod

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,199
finally i will talk about future alert

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,840
and warning

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,920
just to give you a quick

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,760
history about ipos

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,920
it actually evolved from an emergency

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,559
alert program that was started in the

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,280
50s during the cold war under

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,440
presidential executive order

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,559
in the event of enemy attack it was

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,320
intended to broadcast civil defense

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,000
information to public

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
using radio station

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,480
nowadays you're still able to hear from

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,160
tv and radio sometimes like

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,359
this is a test of an emergency alert

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,280
system so that is uh yeas

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,600
which is now is one of the pathway of

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,840
ipod

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,920
so after 50s uh the emergency alert

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,560
system has continued evolved as times

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,600
goes

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,159
in early 2000s

32
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,720
fcc federal communication commission and

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,600
congress pass a regulation and law that

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,079
require wireless carrier network that

35
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,320
provides alert and warning to cellular

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,600
handsets

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,759
that's also known as wireless emergency

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,280
alert

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,079
since then ipos has become this unique

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,680
critical multi-hazard multi-user alert

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,600
and warning nationwide infrastructure

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,320
so ipod actually stands for integrated

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,000
public alert

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,799
and warning system which is measured by

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,600
federal emergency management ac agency

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,200
fema

47
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,840
it was a nationwide alert and warning

48
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,520
infrastructure that provided public

49
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,439
safety officials

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,239
an integrated gateway to send alert

51
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,160
warning message to public music

52
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,120
emergency alert system eas

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,760
wireless emergency alert wga the noaa

54
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,239
weather radios and other public

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,120
alerting system all from a single

56
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,080
interface to let you understand

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,000
uh ipod's open

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,080
system a little more here's the ipod

59
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,200
system

60
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,920
architecture diagram so ipod program

61
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,560
management office is managing two major

62
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,680
system

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,840
on the top is called the national public

64
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,720
warning system that was only can be used

65
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,200
by the president we will focus in on the

66
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,360
bottom part which is ipos open stands

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,920
for open platform for emergency network

68
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,840
that's highlighted in the blue area of

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,519
the diagram

70
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,080
ipos open is actually as a systema

71
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,040
system

72
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,519
it used technology and information

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,680
standard to join multiple private sector

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,959
communication

75
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,879
technology infrastructure

76
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,879
it provides a ability to deliver a

77
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,800
single emergency message

78
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,840
simultaneously propagate to multiple

79
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,560
public dissemination pathways

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,239
bypass open is available for use for

81
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,000
federal state

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,879
local

83
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,519
tribal territorial government entities

84
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,360
across the country

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,599
on the left of the diagram is a learning

86
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,159
authority they were using ipos compliant

87
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,879
alert origination tool to send a

88
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,080
emergency

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,879
alert message to ipos open

90
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,840
those messages will be crafted uh in a

91
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,159
cab standard which also known as common

92
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,480
alerting protocol version 1.2

93
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,000
with a supplement a specification of usa

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,040
ipos open profile version one

95
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,120
the problem i mean the common alerting

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,599
protocol actually is an international

97
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,720
standard that has been adopted over 300

98
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,040
countries and also recognized by the

99
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,439
itu-t recommendation x.1303

100
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,920
you can find out more information

101
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,000
about that in

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,080
oasis cap

103
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,480
ipos open is sitting in the middle

104
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,478
it will aggregate authenticate

105
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,358
disseminate message simultaneously to

106
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,880
multiple uh public dissemination pathway

107
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,240
ipods open act as a cap message broker

108
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,479
dissemination gateway for emergency

109
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,720
information going over the public

110
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,600
alerting system or from one ipod user to

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
another

112
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,080
uh there's a list of alert dissemination

113
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,680
disseminator that's showing on the right

114
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,520
that's connected to the ipod

115
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,360
the first one is an emergency alert

116
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,320
system yeah that's connecting to the

117
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,040
cable satellite radio tv broadcaster all

118
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,400
over the country

119
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
then the second one is the call wireless

120
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
emergency alert that most of people also

121
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,880
have bbc is connecting to the

122
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,280
commercial mobile service provider

123
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,639
gateway via vpn

124
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,759
the emergency message will broadcast by

125
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,360
cellular network to any wea enable

126
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,120
mobile device in a targeted area

127
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,520
wea has a unique feature

128
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,919
unique ringtones and vibration

129
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,320
no subscription based network congestion

avoidance support up to 360 character

131
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,880
for both english and spanish language he

132
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,479
also supporting url and phone number

133
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,199
we also is also providing the geo-target

134
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,440
sensing alert capability with

135
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,039
less than 1 10 of the mile of overseas

136
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,919
we broadcast of a wea alert of duration

137
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,479
and ability to update or cancel active

138
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,400
wea alert

139
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,160
the third one is also called the

140
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,680
non-water emergency message deception

141
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,400
fee

142
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,880
that connecting note to the noaa weather

143
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,400
radio

144
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,000
last but not least

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,720
ipads also providing a public feed for

146
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
other public alerting systems such as

147
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,960
internet applications like facebook

148
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,520
twitter and other websites a state local

149
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,240
unique alerting system such as sirens

150
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,880
roadside and also future technology

151
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,840
device

152
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,440
this is the area we would like to

153
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,280
elaborate more and we'll talk more in

154
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,120
the later slides

155
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,240
after each alert disseminator receives

156
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,199
the emergency alert message the led

157
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,160
message will broadcast based on polygon

158
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,039
circle or geo code

159
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,639
ipos actually is a trusted source

160
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,440
over

161
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,280
1582 public alerting

162
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,360
authority has been signed a memorandum

163
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,400
agreement

164
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,800
and agreed to using ipos to disseminate

165
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,680
the public emergency message

166
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,520
you can see that usage has been

167
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,599
constantly increased over time because

168
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,400
they see the effectiveness of ipod even

169
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,360
though the original purpose of ipos was

170
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,680
to provide president a means of warning

171
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,039
public of impending disaster and attack

172
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,360
but currently ipods play a daily role

173
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,240
that protecting the public by providing

174
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,639

could

297
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,519
directly

344
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,839
blue alert our system goes statewide now

345
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,000
the federal government has approved use

346
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,399
when a police officer is missing

347
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,399
seriously injured or killed in the line

348
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,279
of duty and the suspect is on the run an

349
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,279
alert that arvada investigators say

350
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,279
helped lead to the quick capture of

351
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,600
samuel mcconnell wednesday's alert was

352
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,920
also longer than normal a change that

353
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,079
was made so more information could be

354
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,560
shared at once

355
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,000
you've got to get into this to figure

356
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,600
out how to use it

357
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,880
and i think that's the most important

358
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,639
thing that i would tell people is that

359
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,480
if you don't use it you will get burnt

360
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,800
and i mean that pun intended

361
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,480
you have to use every tool at your

362
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,079
disposal and when hell comes knocking on

363
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,079
doors in your community if you don't

364
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,519
raise the alarm and tell people they

365
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,160
need to get the hell out

366
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,440
you will be in a world to hurt

367
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,560
afterwards

368
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,680
the more

369
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,600
intense the emergency the more pressure

370
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,000
it puts on your systems it puts so much

371
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
pressure on it that the cracks actually

372
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,839
turn into breaks and one of the most

373
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,160
significant ones that we had with the

374
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,560
community was the outrage that we had

375
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,040
not used the wireless emergency alert

376
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,600
system as a county as our emergency

377
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,160
operations center and

378
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,760
it was a black eye in our community

379
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,560
because people died and uh and a lot of

380
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,639
people who left left

381
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,480
running away from flames and they felt

382
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,279
that

383
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,440
we should have alerted them to give them

384
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,490
more time

[Music]

386
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,079
well when an earthquake hits seconds

387
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,680
matter and the county tested its

388
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,519
emergency alert system for earthquakes

389
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,040
today

390
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,800
you're probably one of three and a half

391
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,720
million people in san diego county who

392
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,800
got this alert today the first test of

393
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,639
an earthquake early warning system

394
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,800
called shake alert here's how it works

395
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,480
scientists detect the first wave of

396
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,160
energy from an earthquake they then

397
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,079
estimate magnitude and location of the

398
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,079
next region that'll be affected the

399
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,079
alert goes out before the secondary wave

400
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,000
hits which brings the strongest shaking

401
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,079
and causes the most damage we did an

402
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,240
experiment to see how well it worked we

403
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,079
set up about a dozen phones with both

404
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,480
local and out of state numbers all of

405
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,600
them went off but won

406
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,320
when disaster strikes ipaws allows

407
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
emergency managers and alerting

408
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,040
authorities at all levels to send one

409
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,360
message to more people through multiple

410
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,079
pathways to save lives and protect

411
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,360

415
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,720
as you see

416
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,040
wea is really effective

417
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,120
it's uh not only helping people to

418
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,600
prepare for a natural disaster but you

419
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,320
also play a critical role in community

420
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,880
and helping local emergency authority to

421
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,480
send public alert

422
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,800
and warning message to save lives and

423
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,160
protect property

424
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,399
even though ipods currently has a

425
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,959
comprehensive dissemination

including eas wea noir radio internet

connecting system but the technology

429
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,759
keeps evolving

430
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,759
therefore the alert and warning system

431
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,519
need to continue evolve to prepare for

432
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,119
the future

433
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,160
i

434
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,640
anticipate the internet based technology

435
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,880
will continue dominating communication

436
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,880
and people will continue moving their

437
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,520
daily activity away from traditional tv

438
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,760
and radio to internet connecting service

439
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,039
and products

440
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,039
more internet

441
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:21,919
based

442
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,839
device and application will develop in

443
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,359
the future

444
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,079
for example computer streaming device

445
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,120
smart tv app ai personal assistant

446
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,440
service gaming device and smart kia

447
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,440
so we need more future technology

448
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,480
products

449
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,400
and internet connect service to become a

450
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,840
public alert on one with your

451
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,039
distributor

452
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,679
for example smart home smart building

453
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,000
smart application smart kiosk and any

454
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,760
internet of things device that has an

455
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,280
internet connection that can display

packs play audio or audi

457
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,840
video and they are the great

458
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,600
candidates so how does that work in this

459
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,440
slide it will show you how internet

460
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,600
connecting service and product vendor

461
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,840
will work with ipos open which is

462
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,880
highlighted in the green box

463
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,120
the service or product will first

464
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,280
incorporate cap standard

465
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,240
vendors set up a server and sign a

466
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,360
memorandum agreement with ipos office

467
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,679
vendor then we will receive a unique pin

468
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,720
to access ipad's open public key

469
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,240
here is the company complete a message

470
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,520
process for

471
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,080
that alerting authority will

472
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,400
digitally sign and send a cat message to

473
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,080
ipos open

474
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,039
then ipods will authenticate validate

475
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,520
disseminate the desired dissemination

476
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,960
pathway

477
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,760
every public alert senator ipod will be

478
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,160
posted to ipos public fee which will be

479
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,039
kept for 20 minutes

480
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,520
vendor server will periodically pull

481
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,600
alert from a public fee

482
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,320
then will redistribute it or publish the

483
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,280
same alert message to app website email

484
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,520
list a test message

485
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,480
group

486
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,640
social media road sign sirens etc

487
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,120
so by the way i know many audience here

488
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,600
will be curious about like what we do to

489
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,240
safeguard against the being hacked from

490
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,039
the outside so all internet traffic will

491
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,120
be traversed to department of homeland

492
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,919
security the trusted internet connector

493
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,080
for packet inspection before you wish

494
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,400
out reach to ipos open

495
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,120
so we also following dhs the cyber

496
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,360
security guideline to protecting ipos

497
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,760
open system

498
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,240
so here is a few key items for vendors

499
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,039
who want to consume ipos public feed

500
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,160
first is able to monitor over internet

501
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,440
connection

502
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,640
second

503
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,559
incorporate common alerting protocol the

504
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,640
international standard

505
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,440
there

506
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,160
you will complete a memorandum agreement

507
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,840
or and then you will receive ipos

508
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,360
program office

509
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,440
approval and a unique pin

510
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,440
then you can actually access a monitor

511
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,640
retrieve public alert from ipos public

512
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,520
fee

513
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,960
and finally of course you have to

514
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,600
retraditional the public alert to the

515
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,880
end your end customer

516
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,120
so i hope today's presentation will let

517
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,280
you understand more about public

518
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,640
alert warning

519
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,880
and the internet has a huge potential

520
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,039
and could play an important role in this

521
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,159
sector

522
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,159
when you put on a headphone enjoying

523
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,640
streaming service or keep or

524
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,880
giving command to alexa or playing a

525
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,559
video game in the basement or up in the

526
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,600
mountain

527
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,919
think about do you want those service to

528
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,799
warn you in the event when wildfire

529
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,880
tornado earthquake that is coming to

530
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,440
your area if your answer is yes please

531
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,000
ask those product vendor to be alert

532
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,120
public alert and warning redistributor

533
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,240
besides the internet is huge the area is

534
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,360
so green many apps developing

535
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,200
opportunities available

536
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,840
currently there's only a 110 plus

537
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,880
internet app vendor has access to ipod's

538
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,000
topic fee

539
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,600
as long as you agree and following

540
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,640
ipod's turn you can view apps alert from

541
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,039
us and redistribute to the people

542
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,559
remember receive alert and safe life

543
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,440
and thank you for your time

544
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,799
well thank you may and welcome justin

545
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,439
john kristoff um

546
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,280
you seem to just maybe you were going to

547
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,640
do this in the future but maybe just to

548
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,440
clarify and ask ask for sure the

549
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,559
streaming

550
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,320
media services like the streaming video

551
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,799
like netflix who amazon would that

552
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,039
potentially be included as an ambler and

553
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,600
maybe to anticipate perhaps

554
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,960
the challenge with that so maybe

555
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,640
partially a question a comment to follow

556
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,039
up is how you might reconcile

557
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,559
ascertaining

558
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,960
where the viewer or listener of those

559
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,840
services might actually be

560
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,960
to actually deliver those alerts

561
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,159
such that they're they're useful

562
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,280
so um yeah i think

563
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,159
i was just going to say because the

564
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,320
genes

565
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,600
that's correct so all the alert will be

566
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,080
based on geolocation and uh

567
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,480
and because when they crafted from the

568
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,320
alerting authority they already

569
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,600
identified the polygon a circle where

570
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,159
the targeted area should be happened and

571
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,799
so will be when the message delivers

572
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,799
should be only disseminated to the

573
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,879
selected uh target area

574
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,480
and just to follow up with is is this

575
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
plan to be coming to the stream services

576
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,840
like netflix and

577
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,400
so we want

578
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,480
so that's what we try to do here is that

579
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,799
we try to partner with all the different

580
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,000
streaming services right now we try to

581
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,320
work with them and

582
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,720
right maybe justin you can say like

583
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,080
maybe right now we can't get a

584
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,159
hesitation with those streaming services

585
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,600
because of other

586
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,640
um

587
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,960
legal term and privacy prone that they

588
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,520
haven't really fully on board

589
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,360
and that's why we try to educate this

590
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,880
international community internet

591
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,480
community to have more people

592
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,480
understanding the importance of um the

593
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,559
next like other live streaming service

594
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,159
they should carry that

595
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,200
function to their audience and

596
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,440
that's why we need your your voice to

597
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,799
like let the

598
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,440
vendor let the networks people like hey

599
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,520
i like to have that service i like to

600
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,000
receive that alert if anything happens

601
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,240
in my area wildfire earthquake let me

602
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,039
know

603
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,120
uh even like that i think that's what

604
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,360
we're trying to doing here is by

605
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,320
educating um more people to understand

606
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,960
the importance of the future technology

607
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,480
she embraced

608
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,440
and

609
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,919
continue to carry on this uh really

610
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,080
important message

611
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,320
um that's what we try to do and

612
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,440
we try besides um netflix the streaming

613
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,080
spotify any of the live streams even

614
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,799
like

615
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,320
alexa

616
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,000
or uh siri any of those like daily

617
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,520
activity that we have been interacting

618
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,480
with

619
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,679
those servers

620
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,919
should be carry those message to

621
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,320
individual user

622
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,559
right and just to add to that we

623
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,200
all of all the 110 redistribution

624
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,279
vendors that we mentioned have partnered

625
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,200
with us on a voluntary basis

626
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,480
so um netflix hulu amazon prime no

627
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,320
they're not regulated and they don't

628
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,200
want to be regulated um so it's kind of

629
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,120
an uphill battle for us

630
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,679
um as we try and you know expand public

631
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,120
alert and warning

632
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,039
so that's that's one of the major issues

633
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,120
that we're running into uh and also

634
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,320
they're they're concerned about their

635
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,960
user experience

636
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,200
so we've tried to

637
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,120
say hey why don't you make it a an

638
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,440
opt-in feature of some sort

639
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,039
but between a user experience and

640
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,400
regulation

641
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,310
that's that's our roadblock

642
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:32,159
[Music]

643
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,240
you
