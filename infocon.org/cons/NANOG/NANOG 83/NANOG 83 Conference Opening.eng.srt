done a wonderful job and our volunteers

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,040
are bringing a virtual meeting and we're

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,520
hoping that this experience

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,920
today our first hybrid meeting

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,840
is a fantastic experience for those of

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,000
you that are joining us online and those

22

in person

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,480
we have 307 people here in person that

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,160
have registered

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,600
hopefully growing a little bit today

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,559
with last minute and 198

27
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,680
online for virtual

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,040
to keep everybody safe we went with

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,799
protections we asked everybody that

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,200
could come today to be vaccinated

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,600
it's the best we could do to try to

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,280
safely bring everybody together and have

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,040
that in person experience and start it

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,360

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,920
sponsors um i will comment that sponsors

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,400
are the reason this meeting happened

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,239
we'll go over the financial details at

67
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,400
the members meeting but this will not be

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,239
a profitable meeting we don't have the

69
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,000
attendance for that um

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,560
but because sponsors came forward and

71
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,599
did this we can meet in person they are

72
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,480
critical to nano survival as always but

73
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,000
even more so in years like this

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,400
i will hand it over to our host sponsor

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,380
now abby

76
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,960
[Applause]

77
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,519
thank you very much in some ways

78
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,040
it actually looks a little bit more like

79
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,400
1996 than some of the recent

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,319
nanogs except that some of my friends

81
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,599
magically got older i don't know how

82
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,720
that happened

83
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
um

84
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,879
no not me i don't feel old

85
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,280
and actually i was privileged

86
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,000
while we won't see kat garinsky here i

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,840
saw her a couple days ago

88
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,120
in austin

89
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,239
both

90
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,000
at her side project and for dinner and

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,760
that was awesome

92
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,879
so forward

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,319
so welcome again um i'm excited about

94
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,720
things uh getting back to seeing people

95
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,879
seeing friends having a hallway track

96
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,760
it's also been great to have nanag have

97
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,000
kept up the pace in a virtual way as

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
we've all been adapting there's been a

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,840
lot of cool material

100
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,879
shared

101
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,560
cool presentations and i'm looking

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,480
forward to

103
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,159
this hybrid and

104
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,560
to us all getting back uh hopefully to a

105
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,799
post world at some point and having even

106
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,640
more attendance and more information

107
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,160
sharing nanag has really always been for

108
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
me and for a lot of people about

109
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,160
community um education sharing um

110
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,320
both the formal and informal um and uh

111
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,840
it's really something that as i've

112
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,120
talked with people

113
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,600
um it's been very helpful to continue to

114
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,199
have and also

115
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,000
something that people are excited to

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
evolve

117
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,320
so a little bit background about kentic

118
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,400
we are a network observability company

119
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,199
so

120
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,440
uh the people that run infrastructure

121
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,040
the people that build infrastructure are

122
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,360
typically using us to send telemetry

123
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,919
from their network infrastructure

124
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,320
we gobble all that up process it show

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,160
people things that we think

126
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,320
are important and then are used by

127
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,800
engineers to understand more deeply

128
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
what should be done and then

129
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,600
also

130
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,199
to be part of their automation

131
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,240
infrastructure and to give visibility to

132
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,720
customers whether they're internal

133
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,440
or external

134
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,039
the world is becoming increasingly

135
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,720
diverse especially in networking there's

136
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,560
the stuff that we control there's the

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,199
stuff that we think we control like

138
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,880
other people's paths to us which

139
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,120
sometimes we don't um and the stuff that

140
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,039
we know is out of our control which is

141
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,720
you know our customers use of sas

142
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,800
providers and cloud

143
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,960
and really from a

144
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,639
end user perspective it's all network

145
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,080
and it's ultimately the network people's

146
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,880
responsibility so our view is

147
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,039
getting telemetry from all those areas

148
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,680
is important

149
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,120
ultimately people need to ask questions

150
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,400
end to end uh where are the problems are

151
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,479
we under attack is there a performance

152
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,240
issue and then go to be able to do

153
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,600
things about them

154
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
our view has been

155
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,280
really since we started seven years ago

156
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,600
that it's it's a big data problem

157
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,280
bringing all this data in in real time

158
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,360
keeping it around being able to ask

159
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
questions being able to integrate it's

160
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,960
been great to see the industry evolve

161
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,600
towards observability based approaches

162
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,080
uh even outside the network

163
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,199
realm

164
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,759
um what's new for those um who either

165
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,199
didn't see me do a version of this

166
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,199
presentation at the virtual nanog that

167
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,120
we sponsored last time

168
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
is we've gotten into performance testing

169
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,280
so synthetic testing

170
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,360
we've done a lot with cloud and even

171
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,520
ebpf in the cloud native world

172
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,280
white label portals for service

173
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,880
providers to be able to offer visibility

174
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,360
down to their customers a lot with bgp

175
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,639
monitoring so both your own and

176
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,840
even some

177
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,800
market

178
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,639
observation what's going on on the

179
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,960
internet as a whole and then of course

180
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,720
programmatic

181
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,880
interfaces so apis sdks to use those

182
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,440
and a lot of work to work with other

183
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,440
observability providers

184
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,680
and then a lot of that was enabled by

185
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,319
kintik labs which has been open sourcing

186
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,440

things like

189
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,759

stand up in front of the microphone this

231
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,480
is a great way to submit questions

232
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,000
without having to get up in front of

233
