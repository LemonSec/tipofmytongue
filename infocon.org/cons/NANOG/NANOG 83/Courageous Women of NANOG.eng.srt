my friends

parts of this great community helping me

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,920
handing out

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,040
some

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,640
balloons so

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,759
please

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,360
i'm going to ask you to do something

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,280
while i'm talking

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,000
and so and hopefully this will make it

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,479
interactive fun and

43
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,400
um and then we'll learn something from

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,640
this as well

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,439
so

46
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,079
um what i am going to ask you to do is

47
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,399
as you are receiving these red balloons

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,560
first of all i want to say that

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,759
they are

50
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,200
red because

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,520
it is the favorite color of a dear

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,360
friend and a dear member of this

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,880
community who

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,640
is no longer with us

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,520
susan forney and so

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,719
and

57
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,439
i hope that she's pleased to see that

58
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,520
we're doing this and hopefully this will

59
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,399
bring

60
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,879
all of us together

61
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,720
as a community as well

62
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,319
but

63
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,720
what i'd like you to do is to put your

64
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,680
name with a pen on the balloon

65
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,280
and while i'm talking

66
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,800
blow it up and tie it off and hold on to

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,680
it until we come to the slide that asks

68
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,239
you to participate in the experiment

69
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,480
with me

70
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,879
so you guys probably all know nanog

71
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,800
fairly well you've been if you've been

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,760
here a few times and if you haven't

73
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
then

74
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,879
welcome

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,120
what is nanog and

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,519
you know in a simple way to say it it's

77
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,239
an operator's collective that

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,480
trying to make the internet a better

79
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,040
place for everyone

80
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,680
and it's a great community but what

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,440
makes nanog a great community also makes

82
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,159
it extremely intimidating

83
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,760
and

84
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,360
so what makes it intimidating is because

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,599
the people who have been here who's

86
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,800
working so hard to make the community a

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,720
great place

88
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,519
our tight-knit group of friends

89
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,319
and we work together we may argue with

90
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,440
each other

91
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,920
very strong opinionated people

92
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,799
and

93
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,400
it seems like

94
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,440
we are

95
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,760
very much fighting against each other

96
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,799
and

97
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,280
makes it hard for anybody who is

98
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,599
remotely shy

99
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,239
to want to

100
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,120
participate and talk and feel like they

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,360
can get a word in edgewise

102
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,519
there are also

103
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,560
incredible women in this community who

104
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,760
are exceedingly intelligent

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,560
and what makes them courageous

106
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,840
is that they are not afraid

107
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,519
to speak up

108
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:06,560
to

109
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,280
put themselves in a situation where they

110
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,159
may

111
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,319
feel embarrassed

112
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,560
and or not knowing

113
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,279
exactly what it is that

114
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,600
they are they feel like they may not be

115
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,959
knowing what they're trying to talk

116
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,479
about

117
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,000
and what how they do things

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,040
together

119
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,720
is that they help

120
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,440
others to not feel small

121
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,440
in this large and incredible community

122
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
and

123
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,320
so

124
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,199
if you know how that feels and i can

125
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,960
tell you that that's how i feel

126
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,440
sometimes and even though that i've been

127
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,479
in this community a long time

128
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,919
i still

129
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,320
question oh should i go to the mic and

130
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,919
ask that question

131
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,880
maybe somebody else who's been here

132
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,880
longer who knows more who's more

133
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,240
technical

134
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
could be the one

135
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,000
to ask that question that i want to know

136
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,960
the answer about

137
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,039
because

138
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,720
what if people think less of me

139
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,720
if i went and asked that question

140
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,840
similarly

141
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,919
instead of

142
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,880
presenting coming up here

143
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,440
to say i have something valid to say

144
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
that may help others

145
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,120
you may think well

146
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,520
you know this helped me but i don't know

147
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,560
if anybody else cares or if other people

148
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,400
already know about it

149
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,280
that

150
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,360
why is it important to anyone else

151
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,800
so take a look at these faces

152
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,320
these are women

153
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
who put themselves

154
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,520
in front

155
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,479
of the microphone

156
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,800
in the nanak community

157
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,479
to talk about

158
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,919
the triumphs that they went through

159
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,520
at pocket fabric

160
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,759
in the internet community

161
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,520
to put their fear aside so that they can

162
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,680
share their experience their learnings

163
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,240
with you which is

164
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,600
absolutely

165
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,080
what the community

166
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,960
needs and that's what the internet needs

167
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,560
for all of us to share

168
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,440
what we thought is important

169
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,919
i'm going to highlight a few women that

170
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,280
you may or may not know about

171
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,600
the first one i want to talk about

172
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,120
is

173
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,199
miss sylvie lapelier

174
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,680
and she was

175
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,520
the chairwoman of nanak board

176
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,840
and

177
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,479
one of the first women to be on the nano

178
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,759
board

179
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,240
and i am going to say she helped create

180
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,759
nanog

181
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,319
in today's format

182
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,360
was it an easy feat absolutely not i

183
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
heard stories about

184
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,479
uh having

185
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,960
such heated discussions where a talking

186
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,639
stick had to be utilized

187
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,560
in conversations

188
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,520
so

189
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,680
but at no point she ever gave up on

190
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
working

191
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
for the community for the greater good

192
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,560
of nanog

193
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,080
and

194
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,720
we want to i want to be thankful for her

195
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,240
courage

196
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,759
and determination to create to help us

197
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,960
build this community as is today

198
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,319
and next

199
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,280
i want to talk about miss betty burke

200
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,199
miss betty was the executive director

201
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,960
of nanog

202
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,240
and she had been with nanag

203
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,520
well

204
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,879
forever

205
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,879
right the very beginning

206
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,039
and

207
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,319
not only she had a hand in shaping nanog

208
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,400
as an organization

209
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,440
today

210
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,160
but she had a hand in shaping the

211
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,360
community as it is today

212
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,000
and what i want to say is that she gave

213
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,360
her life

214
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
her energy

215
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,080
to

216
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,360
all of us to this great community

217
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,879
i don't know if many of you know betty's

218
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,800
birthday

219
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,159
often overlaps with nanog

220
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,919
and we have three of them a year and

221
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,880
she

222
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,719
spends

223
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,799
she spent

224
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,200
her birthdays with us

225
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,560
every year

226
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,000
for many many years away from her family

227
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
to give us

228
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,120
this conference

229
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,800
that

230
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,760
benefited all of our lives

231
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,279
and so again i think i would like to

232
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,399
thank

233
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,560
betty just to say betty

234
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,279
thank you for being here for fighting

235
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,560
with us

236
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,200
to create and fighting with the rest of

237
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,160
the world to create this conference to

238
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,720
make this forum available

239
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,440
for all of us

240
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,640
and then

241
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,760
lastly i want to talk about susan forney

242
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,600
susan

243
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,120
was on the current board of nanag

244
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,279
she spoke at lots of different

245
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,839
conferences

246
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,880
and she

247
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,160
and i are good friends

248
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,560
like me

249
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,680
she

250
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,160
is not

251
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,160
really comfortable about public speaking

252
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,080
if you have a stethoscope on my chest my

253
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,080
heart is beating really fast

254
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,440
so

255
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,839
you guys may have similar feelings about

256
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,560
public speaking if you do then you know

257
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,120
what that feels like you feel like

258
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,480
you have a hard time catching your

259
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,320
breath

260
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,279
but

261
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,600
what i want to say is

262
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,880
she put her fear aside because she felt

263
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,120
the community needed to see

264
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,560
that someone like her is able

265
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,760
to lead

266
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,560
and

267
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,800
that means paving the way

268
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,720
for the rest of

269
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,800
the women and others everyone to know

270
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,920
that

271
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,760
if she can do it

272
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
so can you

273
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,680
and

274
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,760
unfortunately she passed earlier this

275
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,880
year

276
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,160
and

277
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,880
i want to make sure that her legacy

278
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,560
stays

279
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,680
fresh

280
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,920
and present with all of us

281
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,360
that

282
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,079
we as a community continue to work

283
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,200
together

284
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,160
to help the next generation to feel that

285
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,399
they have the ability to do anything

286
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,320
that they set out to achieve

287
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,640
so

288
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,480
what do these three women have in common

289
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,880
and what do the rest of us have in

290
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,920
common

291
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,399
we are courageous

292
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,279
there's a lot things that you can do

293
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,600
if you put your mind to it

294
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,920
we're driven

295
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,680
at no point

296
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,160
when we see a problem we shy away from

297
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,519
it

298
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,880
and

299
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,440
the most important thing is that we're

300
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,320
passionate about our community

301
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,000
in what

302
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,920
is the reason why the we're passionate

303
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,360
about our community

304
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,760
is because we believe in

305
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,480
the greater good the internet is doing

306
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,720
for the world

307
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,000
and that

308
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,240
means that we want to share knowledge

309
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,240
we want to build friendship and

310
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,639
mentorship

311
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,600
and then lastly just showing up

312
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,120
being here

313
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,839
is the most important thing

314
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,040
being here whether you are virtually

315
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,360
here with us where you're physically

316
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,000
here with us

317
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,519
showing up

318
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,120
whether just to be attending the

319
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,639
conference

320
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,839
volunteering on one of the committees

321
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,040
or

322
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,399
on the board

323
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,760
contributing

324
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,000
to the community

325
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,720
is the most important

326
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,600
and

327
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,240
i do yoga i don't know that you know any

328
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,079
of you guys do it when i'm in yoga class

329
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,279
the instructor always tells me

330
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,240
you did 80 of the work already just by

331
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,760
showing up

332
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,720
showing

333
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,839
up on your mat is the most important

334
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,920
so give yourself a pat on the back for

335
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,959
being here and that is the first step

336
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,720
towards building an incredible community

337
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,079
so

338
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,279
now

339
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,720
part of

340
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,040
the excitement now you guys all have the

341
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,519
red balloon you have your name on it

342
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,279
you see it

343
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,240
so

344
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,560
think of this as

345
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,680
your success and your happiness

346
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,279
and

347
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,279
toss it in the air as far away as you

348
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,880
can from yourself please

349
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,040
all right

350
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,680
so

351
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,440
now

352
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,680
i hope that you're not paying attention

353
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,480
where it went right

354
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,240
so

355
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,600
now

356
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,440
let's see if you can go

357
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,000
and

358
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,320
find your balloon

359
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,600
and

360
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,360
i know that the room is big and you

361
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,600
probably didn't throw it very far

362
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,839
but

363
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:00,839
the

364
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,079
reason that we're doing this experiment

365
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,760
is because

366
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,639
that it's unlikely for you to easily

367
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,800
find the balloon that's mixed in with

368
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,600
somebody else's balloon

369
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,480
and

370
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,880
this is

371
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,360
the point that i'm trying to make so if

372
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,880
you see you pick up a balloon that's

373
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,120
near you that's got somebody else's name

374
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,240
on it

375
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,600
what i really want you to do is to

376
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,360
help each other find their balloon

377
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,680
right the point that i'm trying to make

378
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,800
here

379
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,160
is that

380
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,199
we all rely on each other

381
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,720
for our success and our happiness

382
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,000
and the women of pocket fabric has been

383
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,199
doing that

384
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,480
and so are the other great volunteers of

385
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,800
 fabric that really have been doing

386
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,959
this

387
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,320
that helping

388
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,000
you find your success and happiness

389
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,519
in this community

390
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,720
and if you could help each other

391
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,000
as well

392
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,839
to help yourselves

393
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,800
i was at dinner last night with someone

394
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,720
that's new to nanog

395
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,959
and

396
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,880
she

397
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,760
i was asking you know what

398
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,519
is the best what what can i do

399
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,639
to gain

400
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,560
the utmost out of

401
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,199
the conference and the community

402
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,279
and a good friend of mine aaron hughes

403
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,320
had said you know the one point that i'm

404
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,600
going to make

405
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,360
is that you give as much as you take to

406
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,800
the community

407
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,040
and you'd be surprised

408
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,639
at what incredible return that you get

409
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,360
from the people that are here

410
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,920
because the community itself

411
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,959
is

412
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,600
so giving

413
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,120
that

414
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,079
you

415
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,880

is

450
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,919
don't

451
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,880
let

452
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,679
your fear get in the way

453
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,919
of doing

454
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,240
doing anything because

455
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,160
i would rather have tried and failed

456
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
now i've learned

457
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,039
then

458
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,799
not tried at all

459
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,600
and i know that so many people and again

460
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,480
it's

461
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,600
it's a revelation for me is that so many

462
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,840
people

463
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,559
don't try because they're afraid of

464
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,160
failure

465
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,960
and

466
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,520

are you trying to learn something

500
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,039

a network

502
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,559

how

505
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,320
the internet actually works because

506
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,559
trust me what you learn in school and

507
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,799
what you read in the books is not how

508
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,240
the internet actually works

509
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,640
the internet is run by people there was

510
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
a keynote earlier

511
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,160
and it's run by people in this community

512
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,440
so

513
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,280
if you want to know how it actually

514
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,080
works the global network which fuels the

515
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,039
global economy today

516
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,679
gives you immense power in knowing how

517
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,880
it works

518
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,679
and

519
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,840
you can affect changes

520
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,720
in the world by understanding how you

521
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,320
can make a change

522
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,799
how you can affect changes

523

526
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,919
lead by example

527
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,679
come and do

528
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,960
and lead

529
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,799
being a leader means that you're going

530
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,559
to be doing something

531
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,760
that resonates with others so that they

532
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,640
follow you being a leader isn't

533
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,880
you coercing other people doing what you

534
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,679
want because that's not leading

535
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,200
and

536
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,080
there are i'm going to highlight this

537
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,919
several committees

538
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,120
that

539
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,360
at nanog that could use

540
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,720
support always and volunteers

541
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,640
and

542
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,880
there's one that is

543
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,360
really important because

544
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,480
susan forney was the chair

545
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,679
for

546
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,679
the mentorship committee

547
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,320
and as she is no longer with us

548
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,120
mentoring is extremely important because

549
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,200
that helps us bringing

550
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,080
young

551
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,200
and new individuals into the committee

552
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,320
into the

553
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,440
community

554
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,880
and we can use

555
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
anyone who's driving the

556
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,320
mentorship program we can use mentors

557
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,559
and we can certainly use

558
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,120
additional mentees so

559
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,960
come and participate

560
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,799

561
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,080

566
