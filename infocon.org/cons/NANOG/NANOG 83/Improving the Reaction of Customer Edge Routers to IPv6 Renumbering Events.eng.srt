[Music]

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,759
okay uh good morning good afternoon or

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,160
good evening depending on where you are

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,320
my name is fernando gondt i am director

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,880
of information security at the juno

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,279
and i will be doing a presentation on

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,760
improving the reaction of customer edge

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,320
routers to ipv6 renumbering events okay

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,080
so um let's introduce a typical you know

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,560
ipv6 deployment scenario

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,880
uh such as for example um you know an

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,680
ipv6 home deployment in the this kind of

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,760
scenario you typically have a

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,120
a customer edge router that connects the

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,680
home network to the isp network and

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,600
typically when it comes to protocols

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,200
that are involved

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,520
the cpu router communicates with the isp

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,600
network usda version 6 graphically

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,160
and it typically also employs slack to

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,360
communicate

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,920
information on the land side the idea

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,120
here is that with dhcp version 6 prefix

24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,119
delegation the customer edge router can

25
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,200
get a perfect list from the isp and then

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,600
on the lan side it can announce a sub

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,240
prefix of the prefix that got list okay

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,520
now uh let's think about a problem

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,159
scenario that unfortunately it's quite

30
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,119
common these problem scenario that um i

31
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,520
will be describing will be focused on

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,079
the ipv6 home deployment scenario for

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,240
you know simplicity say from for

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,200
simplicity's sake but uh there are

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,680
actually other um you know network

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,479
scenarios where the exactly the same

37
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,640
problem may arise

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,600
so let's consider for a second that the

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,960
customer edge router is hard reboot

40
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,360
and and what am i meaning by hard wood

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,000
well somebody just unplugged the

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,159
customer edge router and then plug the

43
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,680
router again

44
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,799
um what will happen or what would happen

45
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,520
with this customer edge router comes

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,639
back to life well quite frequently or in

47
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,959
most cases the router will have no

48
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,280
knowledge about what was the prefix that

49
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,760
was being uh that had been leased before

50
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,560
okay so what this device will do it will

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,319
request a new prefix to the isp via the

52
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,280
hcp version 6 prefix delegation

53
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,480
and from the prefix that gets uh list it

54
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,800
will announce a sub prefix on the lan

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,480
site okay

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,200
now depending on the number of factors

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,319
the customer edge water might get at

58
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,879
least the same prefix as before

59
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,680
or a completely new prefix there are

60
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,120
cases where

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,319
isps intentionally you know lease a new

62
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,400
prefix in these scenarios

63
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,560
now what happens if the customer adds

64
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,120
water got at least a new prefix

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,280
well these new prefix will be announced

66
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,360
on the land side but what happens with

67
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
prefix the brief the prefix that was

68
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,159
being used before well if there were any

69
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,000
systems that had already configured

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,200
addresses for that old or state prefix

71
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,599
that prefix will still be there and the

72
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,120
old addresses will still be there

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,519
now this is obviously this obviously you

74
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,239
know uh introduces you know connectivity

75
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,920
problems because at the end of the day

76
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,400
what happens is that after for example

77
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,040
these uh reboots events that sometimes

78
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,440
are called flash renumbering events

79
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,319
you end up with systems on your network

80
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,640
using uh you know all prefixes all

81
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
addresses and this results in

82
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,080
connectivity problems

83
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,920
so what i will do during this

84
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,840
presentation is try to um

85
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,799
describe part of the work that we did at

86
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,440
the idf on this area

87
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,360
when we look at all the work that has

88
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,840
been done at the ietf when it comes to

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,799
these

90
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,120
so-called flash remembering events we

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,280
have a you know a few documents that

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,959
were uh produced

93
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,040
uh the first document was rfc 8978

94
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,120
which is a document that essentially uh

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,680
discusses the you know the the problem

96
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,159
itself like all the different scenarios

97
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,400
where you might end up in situations

98
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,000
where you know a router gets at least a

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,720
different prefix than before so you end

100
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,520
up with local nodes using you know all

101
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,080
the information all prefixes and all all

102
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,600
addresses

103
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,160
then there is ongoing work in the you

104
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,240
know six-month working group on this

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,720
document draft idf six-month slack

106
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,840
renown where what we are trying to do is

107
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,880
introduce changes to the slack protocol

108
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,240
such that slack can let's say deal more

109
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,160
gracefully with these kind of

110
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,240
renumbering events

111
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,520
and finally there was a another rfc rfc

112
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,919
in 1996 we

113
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,000
recommend the recommendations for

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,479
customer edge writers

115
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,880
uh and this is essentially the topic of

116
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,479
this presentation

117
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,720
what uh this document rsc 1996

118
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,520
contains is essentially two things on

119
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,560
one hand it contains uh recommendations

120
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,960
for uh let's say vendors uh you know

121
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,759
producing customer edge routers because

122
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,000
in a number of areas you know there is

123
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
uh

124
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,039
you know some some some room for the

125
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,960
vendor you know to do things one way or

126
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
another so this document provides

127
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,199
recommendations on how to get things

128
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,360
right such that to the extent that is

129
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,600
possible this problem is you know is

130
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,840
mitigated or minimized

131
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,080
on the other hand one of the things that

132
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,240
the other thing that this document rfc

133
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,520
19 19 1996 does

134
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,320
is

135
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,960
provide advice to network operators when

136
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,440
it comes to how to set or how to

137
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,759
configure different protocol values

138
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,600
timers in particular

139
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,360
such that this problem that we are

140
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,280
describing here you know can be

141
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,440
mitigated

142
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,560
so let's look essentially at each of the

143
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,000
requirements

144
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,560
that uh rfc 1996 introduces okay

145
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,240
as i mentioned before

146
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,479
some of the requirements could be uh

147
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,560
let's say applied or complied with

148
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,639
operationally so that means you could

149
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,000
have a you know a customer in water that

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,280
you know predates this rfc but still you

151
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,759
know via the configuration interface you

152
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,080
might be able to tweak some you know

153
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,400
protocol parameters which uh you know

154
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
might be of a lot of help to try to

155
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,639
reduce the impact of uh you know the

156
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,280
problem that we are describing here on

157
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,520
the other hand uh i think that this

158
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,000
document is a lot of value uh in cases

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,440
where um you know you have rfps

160
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
and uh you know you want to purchase

161
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,919
devices you uh you are you know aware

162
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,599
and concerned about this problem so you

163
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,080
can you know point your vendor you know

164
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,240
to this document and you know ask them

165
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,319
to implement these requirements that the

166
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,639
idea has produced

167
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,599
so let's jump to the requirements

168
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,199
themselves

169
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,400
so the first requirement is about or

170
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,639
it's about

171
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,000
customer edge routers not doing dhcp

172
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,039
version 6 releases and what is it all

173
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,319
about well you have devices that uh when

174
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,280
uh for example the user or the operator

175
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,080
does

176
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,919
a graceful uh

177
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,840
device reboot and this would be

178
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,800
obviously be a for example a web

179
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,960
interface to the device where you you

180
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,680
know you select the reboot

181
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,840
and the device shuts down and then you

182
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,720
know reboots as opposed to like uh let's

183
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,039
say a more abrupt reboot where you just

184
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,720
unplug the device and you know you plug

185
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,840
it again

186
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,160
some devices in those scenarios where

187
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,800
you when where you do a graceful reboot

188
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,440
they send a dhcp version 6 release

189
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,800
message to the isp okay prior to the

190
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,680
reboot event now what this means in

191
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,759
practice is that the device is

192
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,039
essentially telling the isp look i'm not

193
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,360
going to use this prefix that you had

194
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,639
list before okay so it's free for you to

195
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,560
use with any other client

196
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,800
now the problem with sending dhcp

197
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,080
version 6 release messages is that in

198
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,680
most cases

199
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,400
if you do a dhcp version 6 release if

200
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,240
you send a dhcp version 6 release

201
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,120
message and afterwards you know you ask

202
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,759
the isp for a new prefix most likely

203
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,840
you're going to get a different prefix

204
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,399
so by sending a dhcp version 6 release

205
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,279
message essentially you are introducing

206
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,760
uh you know a renumbering event that

207
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,279
could have possibly been avoided so

208
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,480
uh in in you know in in summary the

209
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,360
requirement here that devices should

210
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,880
send vhc release messages when rebooting

211
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,800
the user might have the option to you

212
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,680
know

213
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,160
change the prefix which could cause one

214
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,240
of these messages to be sent but the

215
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,720
idea is that the reboot event should uh

216
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,040
you know uh should not uh you know

217
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,279
elicit one of these dhcp release

218
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,839
messages

219
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,839
the second requirement has to do with

220
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,320
the interface between the one side and

221
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,600
the lan side okay

222
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,360
there are some devices that for example

223
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,399
they

224
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,800
request the prefix on the one side they

225
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,279
get a prefix list let's say for five

226
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,360
hours but then when they have to

227
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,959
announce some prefixes on the plant side

228
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,160
they use lifetimes that span past the

229
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,600
lifetime of the original prefix okay

230
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,839
obviously this means that your isp is

231
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,000
leasing you a prefix and it's

232
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,680
guaranteeing that you know you will be

233
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,160
able to use that prefix for say five

234
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,040
hours but if you're announcing the sub

235
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,920
prefixes with a longer lifetime then you

236
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,959
know in between the isp might you know

237
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,959
change your prefix and then you know the

238
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,880
lifetime that you are announcing on the

239
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,000
land side might be might become embedded

240
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,720
so um the requirement here is you know

241
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,079
quite simple

242
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,240
the lifetimes that you use for the you

243
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,480
know for the prefixes on the

244
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,680
land side both for slack or dhcp if your

245
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,480
member employs dhcp version 6 on the on

246
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,760
the left side

247
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,880
must never

248
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,360
spam past the received lifetimes on the

249
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,240
one side okay so if you get a you know

250
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,959
if you get a prefix list for you know

251
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,079
say five hours then the lifetimes on the

252
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,560
outside should be five hours or less

253
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,880
than that

254
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,240
third requirement

255
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,680
is the landside options uh lifetimes

256
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,640
okay

257
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,519
uh

258
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,880
normally when it comes to ipv6 you have

259
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,600
customer edge routers and using a

260
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,839
variety of uh you know network

261
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,399
configuration parameters on the lan side

262
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,600
via clock okay and many if not

263
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,839
most of these options have an associated

264
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,440
lifetime

265
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,360
many implementations use like you know

266
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,839
the full values or have hardcoded values

267
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,839
for the you know for the lifetime values

268
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,640
but when you really think about it you

269
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,880
know for many if not most or all of the

270
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,720
parameters that you might possibly

271
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,079
announce they are somehow tied you know

272
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,040
to the uh to the lifetime of the prefix

273
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
that you have been list let's think of

274
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,760
let's consider for example the case of

275
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,680
of the address of a recursive dns server

276
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,120
okay

277
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
there is some relationship with the you

278
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,519
know dna recursive dns server that you

279
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,839
might want to use depending on what's

280
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,360
the prefix that you're using for your

281
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,959
addresses okay

282
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,399
um so

283
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,279
if the addresses that you are you know

284
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,360
um employing for your network

285
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,920
essentially change well then you should

286
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,480
probably consider also changing other

287
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,720
network configuration information that

288
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,560
you might be using so the associated uh

289
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,519
your requirement here says that you know

290
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,600
the options that you use on the land

291
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,399
side whether with slack or whether with

292
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,600
dhcp version 6 should never

293
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,959
passed the uh receive the ac version six

294
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,600
lifestyles on the one side

295
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,240
or as an example if for example you got

296
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,600
a prefix list for let's say five hours

297
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,399
any options that you advertise

298
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,720
on the land side for example with slack

299
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,440
should have lifetimes smaller than five

300
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
hours okay

301
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,760
in this way you make sure that you know

302
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,720
if eventually the prefixes become stale

303
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,800
well then also the other information

304
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,040
becomes stale and you have a chance to

305
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,639
you know renew that information

306
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,160
uh the next requirement is about

307
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,720
signaling stale information so if you

308
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,480
think about the the problem we are

309
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,720
dealing with essentially the problem is

310
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,959
that you know you have your customer

311
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,720
edge router you know announcing

312
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,120
information on the land side now

313
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,200
eventually the information somehow it

314
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,760
becomes stale for example you know the

315
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,399
the device was reboot and now the the

316
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,040
the your isp has leased you a different

317
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,720
prefix

318
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,360
and the problem is that you know in many

319
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,079
scenarios there's you know no device in

320
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,200
the network telling the local nodes look

321
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,040
information has changed you have to

322
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,200
remove the old information and you have

323
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,880
to use this new information that i'm

324
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,360
providing that i'm providing here

325
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,079
now one of the key challenges associated

326
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,760
with you know signaling scale

327
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,320
information is that for for example when

328
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,120
it comes to uh customer edge routers

329
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,240
in many cases they don't really store

330
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,079
the information that they receive from

331
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,199
the isp on stable storage

332
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,959
to put things you know in a different

333
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,880
way you know you have a device it

334
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,600
requests the prefix to the isp it gets a

335
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,320
perfect list from the isp now the device

336
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,959
gets rebooted and once the device has

337
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,519
reboot it has no way of knowing what was

338
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,839
the prefix that was being used before so

339
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,240
it receives the prefix from the isp and

340
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,000
it's impossible for the device to tell

341
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,839
whether this is the same prefix as

342
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,440
before or not

343
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,000
so what this requirement suggests is

344
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,720
that to the extent that is possible you

345
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,519
know the customer edge water or whatever

346
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,519
router that you are using

347
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,839
stores information that is received from

348
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,959
the upstream unstable storage

349
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,120
and if it's possible you know for the

350
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,880
device to store the information on

351
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,920
stable storage if the device you know

352
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,920
gets reboot for example or the device

353
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,320
somehow detects that the information has

354
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,920
changed okay the device should announce

355
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,040
the

356
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,560
new information

357
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,480
you know with the your normal you know

358
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,800
lifetime values but it should also

359
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,680
announce or advertise the old

360
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,320
information with a very small lifetime

361
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,959
values for example possibly zero the

362
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,120
effect of this will be of course that on

363
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,519
one hand you will be announcing

364
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,600
the new information with normal lifetime

365
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,839
so that information will propagate in

366
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,920
the network but on the other hand you

367
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,399
are announcing the old information with

368
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,360
a lower for example zero lifetime which

369
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,839
will cause any systems on the local

370
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,399
network to essentially deprecate or

371
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,560
eliminate that information okay

372
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,839
uh and

373
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,279
finally um

374
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,839
the final requirement that this document

375
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,600
has

376
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,480
is that the bottom line is that besides

377
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,639
all of the you know other considerations

378
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,399
that we have made during this

379
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,279
presentation if you look at the lifetime

380
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,360
values that are you know currently

381
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,120
employed by slack it's very easy to tell

382
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,680
that they are inappropriate okay

383
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,759
for example when it comes to lifetime

384
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,160
values that are employed for network

385
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,839
prefixes that are employed for you know

386
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,839
address configuration there are

387
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,160
essentially two lifetime values involved

388
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,839
the preferred lifetime and the valid

389
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,199
lifetime okay

390
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,920
they prefer lifetime essentially uh

391
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,720
specifies the uh the period of time

392
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,600
during which you can use these addresses

393
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,000
addresses configured for this prefix for

394
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,639
issuing for example new uh connection

395
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,120
request okay for um you know

396
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,600
establishing new communications whereas

397
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,079
on the other hand the valid lifetime uh

398
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,880
specifies for how long you can use the

399
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,839
addresses meaning uh and others might be

400
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,079
preferred and valid meaning you can use

401
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,399
you can issue new connections for that

402
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,800
address or it could be for example not

403
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,199
prefer but valid meaning you cannot

404
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,880
issue new connections with that address

405
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,480
but you can you know continue

406
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,639
communicating with you know any existing

407
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,480
connection that you might have

408
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,600
now the default values as specified in

409
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,680
the slack specification

410
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,560
are

411
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,800
seven days for the preferred lifetime

412
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,160
and 30 days for the valid lifetime

413
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,560
now if you think about this for a second

414
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,199
the implications of you know these uh

415
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,079
life stance values are as follows

416
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,079
the valid lifetime essentially means

417
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,559
that you know if a water announces a

418
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,559
prefix sensor packet like a voter

419
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,880
advertisement okay with a valid lifetime

420
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,480
of 30 days

421
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,119
then even if the router doesn't announce

422
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,119
that prefix anymore for the next 30 days

423
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,679
notes on the local network will be able

424
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,520
to continue

425
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
using the addresses that they configure

426
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,760
for this prefix okay so there's

427
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,720
obviously a trade-off here okay on one

428
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,960
hand you want to use you know short

429
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,600
lifetime values so that you know if

430
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,640
information

431
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,480
from network configuration information

432
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,039
somehow becomes stale well you don't

433
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,240
really have to wait for say 30 days for

434
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,960
the information to get discarded okay

435
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,440
now on the other hand you want lifetime

436
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,760
values that are long enough so that if

437
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,000
there's any transient you know um

438
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,320
problem then you know communications can

439
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,640
still survive for example if somehow you

440
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,200
know by mistake you unplug a switch so

441
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,760
now the network became partitioned you

442
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,000
don't want you know the prefixes and the

443
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,240
addresses to you know just time out and

444
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,679
you know become deprecated and

445
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,679
eliminated but you want to be able to um

446
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,919
essentially survive those kinds of you

447
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,919
know transition network failures

448
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,080
okay so what are the values that we

449
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,640
recommend in the rfc so we recommend

450
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,360
these two values which as you might see

451
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,280
are very conservative still very

452
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,840
conservative so for the preferred

453
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,120
lifetime we recommend a default value of

454
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,559
45 minutes

455
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,799
for 45 minutes this is compared to the

456
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,000
seven days value uh that uh we have in

457
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,039
this like specification nowadays and for

458
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,480
the valid lifetime we recommend a valid

459
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,280
lifetime a default value lifetime of 90

460
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,480
minutes as opposed to the 30 days that

461
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,360
you have in the slack specification so

462
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,840
you might see it's easy to see that

463
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,039
though we

464
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,559
are proposing a very big reduction in

465
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,559
you know in the in the lifetimes that

466
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,280
are employed the bottom line here is

467
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,679
that for example for the valid lifetime

468
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,080
even if information changes and you know

469
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,640
there's no way to signal the uh you know

470
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,799
the stale information or the of the

471
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,600
change of information to the local nodes

472
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,120
in the worst case scenario if you uh

473
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,039
your network will not operate with

474
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,240
stealing for

475
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,799
with still information for longer than

476
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,760
90 minutes okay

477
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,559
so um some conclusions uh you know uh

478
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,559
regarding you know the materials that we

479
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,840
have covered uh in this

480
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,799
presentation first of all uh we analyzed

481
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,679
uh mitigations to a problem

482
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,280
that uh you know has been uh documented

483
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,520
in rfc

484
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,640
8978 there was you know a lot of uh work

485
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,280
or a lot of you know uh

486
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,520
a lot of energy that you know took that

487
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,799
project uh because there were like the

488
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,799
people that were arguing that you know

489
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,600
the case of uh flash remembering events

490
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,200
uh wasn't the case that should be

491
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,520
supported by the by the protocol so if

492
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,000
somehow your network was renumbered okay

493
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,840
that's uh you know that's a problem that

494
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,360
you have to live with but you know

495
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,559
eventually we we were able to uh publish

496
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,880
rsc 1889 78 discussing the problem the

497
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,480
different scenarios where this problem

498
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,799
might arise etc

499
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,080
um

500
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,679
we also have nowadays you know a new rfc

501
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,760
published earlier this year rfc 1996

502
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,559
which contains two things essentially

503
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,120
requirements for customer customer

504
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,400
educators

505
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,440
and

506
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,240
operational best practices if you wish

507
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
with recommendations on how you could

508
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,280
possibly tweak some network parameters

509
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,480
uh to mitigate uh you know the effects

510
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,760
of uh flash remembering events

511
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,120
so i would say or i would argue that uh

512
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,679
you know this document is useful uh you

513
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,280
know it's

514
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,120
that the the usefulness of this document

515
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,760
is is twofold on one hand if you are a

516
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,000
network operator please take a look at

517
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,240
the recommendations on how to you know

518
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,080
to set these um network parameters uh

519
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,039
which might allow you to uh deal more

520
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,360
gracefully with these kind of scenarios

521
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,080
even if you are using uh network devices

522
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,360
that predate this rfc on the other hand

523
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,360
uh if you have any upcoming rf rfps uh

524
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,480
you know this document rfc 1996 might be

525
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,720
a good document uh you know to point

526
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,280
your vendors to uh so that they they

527
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,480
implement these recommendations

528
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,080
so so far uh this has been the

529
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,840
presentation

530
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,600
and now we have times for q as

531
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,600
um we maybe have time for just one or

532
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,080
two questions i'll take them online uh

533
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,679
very briefly um

534
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,840
we have uh one question from blake

535
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,720
willis who asks uh if you're aware of

536
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,280
the ietf work that's been synced up with

537
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,720
the efforts of hopefully pronouncing

538
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,480
last night uh last name

539
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,320
zorus to produce our uh ripe uh 554

540
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,200
bis for a device specification document

541
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,840
said something in comment on

542
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,159
yes actually uh young source is one of

543
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,919
the co-authors of all the work that we

544
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,159
have been doing of the program statement

545
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,720
the operational recommendations and the

546
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,039
uh you know update to the slack protocol

547
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,600
um essentially the right document what

548
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,120
was recommended was to um use stable

549
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,520
prefixes but there are you know multiple

550
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,679
reasons like that for you know edge uh

551
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,360
routers um

552
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,039
but there are reasons for which in some

553
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,600
cases that's not applicable and uh so

554
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,919
what we are trying to do is uh you know

555
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,159
from uh you know from

556
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,400
different angles to try to improve the

557
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,240
the situation but yeah the right

558
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,080
document is aligned with this work that

559
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,640
we are pursuing at the idea

560
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,400
thank you and one question from the mic

561
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,159
and i'm sorry for the people online i

562
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,280
know you have a couple other questions

563
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,760
but we're going to have to move on

564
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,360
blame it on your crummy moderator so go

565
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,320
ahead please thomas florin from data

566
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,760
so in your presentation you focused on

567
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,280
slack on the

568
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,320
land side does it apply the same way for

569
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,039
dhcp v6 on the land side

570
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,600
does it face the same problems

571
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,960
yes exactly the same problem

572
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,880
okay well let's give you a round of

573
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,720
applause for both talks thank you very

574
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,120
much for for presenting here bernando

575
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,279
thank you

576
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,619
