2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,040
hello my name is melchior i'm a

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,360
consulting engineer with juniper

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,000
and i'll be presenting today about a

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,920
quantum key distribution and a little

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,280
bit more in general about quantum

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,800
networking

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
during the presentation we'll also have

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,840
a small demo

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,199
on how qkd works and ashwin will talk

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,519
you through the demo and show you how we

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,840
can leverage qkd in

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,640
ipsec in this case so in this

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,079
presentation we'll

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,239
start with a small introduction to

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,040
quantum networking and what is it and

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,719
what language are we using so some

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,640
terminology

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,719
then we'll look at what quantum key

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,719
distribution actually is so how we can

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,600
use

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,120
quantums

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,920
or

24
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,960
polarized photons to distribute a key

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,640
material

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,160
and then we'll pull that together and

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,800
see how we can use qkd in

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,520
ipsec and mexican and other

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,280
security protocols and algorithms and

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,239
we'll go into the demo

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,360
so

32
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,920
to start with

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,240
touching on a few potential fields of

34
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,080
interest of where

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,040
we could use quantum technology in

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,799
in networking

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,040
the first is

38
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,640
using a

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,119
chip a so-called quantum random number

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,680
generator which could be integrated into

41
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,280
a firewall or router or server

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,600
and that basically

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
uses

44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,400
a quantum technology to generate

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
entropy

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,240
and with that and you can

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,479
or you can use that to generate a key

48
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,600
material

49
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,560
um why would you want to use such a chip

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,079
because

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,399
the randomness

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,320
is much higher than uh using um

53
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,880
random or you random on linux for

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,920
example

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,799
um so you and the rate um

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,040
it can generate a randomness is also

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,639
much higher

58
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,360
the second field is using

59
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,760
properties of quantum mechanics to

60
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,480
share the key material and that could be

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,480
keys that are

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,000
generated from a qrng or could be

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,959
simply

64
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,239
keys

65
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,959
that are generated on a router or switch

66
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,160
etc

67
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,120
and you

68
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,879
want a safe way to communicate those

69
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,560
keys to the other side

70
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,800
the third is

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,560
a field of interest is post quantum

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,560
cryptography or in other words

73
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,080
uh quantum

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,640
sorry security protocols and mechanisms

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,879
that are quantum resistant

76
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,000
um because one of the

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,080
things we'll see in this presentation as

78
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,599
well is that

79
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,120
some of the

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,760
algorithms we're using are not resistant

81
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,599
against attacks from quantum computers

82
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,120
and that leads me to the problem

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,599
statement

84
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,400
mechsec which or

85
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,159
aes256 which is used in for example

86
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,920
mexican and other

87
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,400
security protocols on itself is quantum

88
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,519
resistant

89
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,280
especially if you

90
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,360
because you're able to simply double the

91
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,400
key size if at one point a quantum

92
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,640
computer might be so powerful that it

93
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,959
could crack the key

94
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,599
however the issue is how do you

95
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,200
share that key

96
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,440
right so you need to have a mechanism to

97
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,799
share

98
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,879
a

99
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,720
key between two parties

100
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,879
and

101
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,159
many of the

102
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,000
security protocols we're currently using

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,599
are based on

104
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,120
prime numbers

105
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,920
and

106
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,239
if the prime number if you

107
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,840
want to factor that

108
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,920
that is really hard especially if the

109
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
prime number is very large that is

110
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,959
really hard for a classical computer but

111
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,959
it is especially a

112
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,439
task a quantum computer is really good

113
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,120
at especially

114
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,239
when using the schwarz algorithm

115
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,799
that describes how a quantum computer

116
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,560
could factor a

117
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
prime number so at one point it is

118
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,079
expected that a quantum computer becomes

119
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,600
powerful enough

120
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,560
to run this algorithm and then it's able

121
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,320
to factor those

122
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,199
pre-shared keys

123
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,240
let's also see what we're not talking

124
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
about um

125
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,479
we're not um

126
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,360
we're not using quantum computers um so

127
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,560
we're using

128
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,479
some of the quantum properties

129
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
but a

130
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,400
quantum key distribution doesn't require

131
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,240
any quantum computers so

132
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,000
everything we're talking about in this

133
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,360
presentation

134
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
can be done at room temperature right

135
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,680
for a quantum computer you need

136
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,000
specialized rooms with extreme cooling

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,360
etc

138
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,919
but in this case it's equipment that

139
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,560
can be used as i said on in at room

140
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,320
temperature

141
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,840
we're also not

142
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,400
securing the network with quantums right

143
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
the way we

144
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,560
transmit data from

145
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,880
one side to the other from alice to bob

146
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,479
is still using

147
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,600
classical mechsec or ipsec it's just the

148
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
way we are

149
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
distributing keys between

150
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,960
both parties that are using

151
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,680
properties of quantum

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,000
to do so

153
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,880
um so let's see what it does and how it

154
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,039
works so some of the language and

155
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,400
terminology

156
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
um the biggest difference probably

157
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,199
between as the physicists call classical

158
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,280
networking what we're doing today and

159
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,360
quantum networking is that in classical

160
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,080
networking a classical bit is always a

161
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,000
zero or one

162
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,479
whereas in a quantum

163
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,280
a qubit can be zero one or anything in

164
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,960
between

165
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,039
and you only know

166
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,680
if it's a zero or one once you observe

167
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,319
it or measure it as they say

168
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,319
and that phenomenon is called a

169
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,479
superposition

170
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,479
and one of the most interesting

171
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,039
properties of a qubit especially in the

172
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,520
context of security is that you cannot

173
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,039
copy it

174
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,120
that is also the biggest

175
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,199
downside of a qubit

176
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,199
as you cannot transport

177
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,680
qubits over

178
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,919
cwd or dwdm

179
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,440
equipment especially if it's amplified

180
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,400
because then the quantum state the qubit

181
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,039
gets lost

182
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,400
so it is an advantage and that is where

183
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,600
qkd

184
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,840
is based

185
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,479
on but again it's also something the

186
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,160
physicists will need to solve going

187
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,680
forward in order for me to make this

188
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,560
better scalable

189
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,919
as i mentioned the qubit can be zero or

190
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,560
one and that is called a superposition

191
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,680
and

192
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,919
in very simple

193
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,080
words by the way i'm not a physicist and

194
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,000
this is by far not a physics class

195
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,880
but

196
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,240
in really basic terms superposition of

197
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,319
in this case a photon is

198
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,599
basically

199
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,160
a laser um that puts

200
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,919
the photon into

201
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,039
a certain polarization and

202
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,360
once it's polarized or in superposition

203
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,199
you send it to the other side

204
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,520
and the other side can measure that

205
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,240
photon and read or measure the

206
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,120
superposition

207
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,840
as i

208
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,360
mentioned um

209
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,000
you cannot copy that the the the state

210
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
you bring it in so the superposition

211
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,160
is really

212
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,479
let's say sensitive right so

213
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,280
you need a high quality fiber you cannot

214
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,879
amplify it

215
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,800
the distance is limited

216
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,440
if you use it in a

217
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,800
passive cwdm or dwm system

218
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,240
it could work

219
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,039
but

220
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,199
you need to be aware of interference of

221
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,400
other

222
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,000
sources of light as well so there's

223
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,800
still lots of work to do there

224
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240
by the way on many of the slides you

225
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,680
will see links

226
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,280
so if you're interested in reading

227
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,520
further i would suggest to visit the

228
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,840
links

229
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,560
um

230
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,479
quantum teleportation um

231
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,760
probably you've seen it in in movies um

232
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,559
that

233
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,919
we cannot

234
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,120
teleport

235
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,360
physical objects the only thing we can

236
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,958
teleport is

237
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,760
a state or a superposition

238
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,560
um basically a photon that is brought

239
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,440
into

240
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,240
or has a certain polarization

241
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,080
and that polarization describes the

242
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,839
quantum state so that is the only thing

243
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,519
unfortunately we can

244
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,000
transfer

245
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,240
there are several ways

246
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,800
to do that

247
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,880
in qkd and we basically have one side

248
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,959
that is always sending the photons to

249
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,560
the other side

250
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,880
so alice will always be the one

251
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,160
polarizing photons and send those to bob

252
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,480
bob has a special filter where it put

253
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,720
the photons through and so it can

254
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,959
measure the

255
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,959
the superposition of the photon and that

256
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,279
is then called teleportation so you

257
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,640
teleport

258
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,600
a state from one side to the other

259
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,560
there's also entanglement

260
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,519
which

261
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,839
basically means you bring a polarized

262
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,920
photon really close to

263
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,360
another photon and that photon then will

264
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,519
take over the the

265
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,320
superposition state of the first photon

266
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
and then if you bring them apart they

267
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,720
will still have the same state so if you

268
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,399
measure one side the other side will

269
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,680
collapse into the same state

270
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,240
again really short description of how

271
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,399
this works please visit the links if you

272
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,519
want to

273
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,360
read further

274
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,000
so as i mentioned some of the advantages

275
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,720
obviously the biggest advantage of using

276
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,920
a quantum to distribute

277
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,440
in this case key material is that you

278
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,399
cannot

279
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,480
copy the photons um so you are

280
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,200
uh

281
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
guaranteed as far as you can guarantee

282
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,760
obviously um you're guaranteed that that

283
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,560
a

284
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,519
uh the only one who will know uh the

285
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,480
state of the photon is the the intended

286
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,920
receiver

287
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,360
um

288
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,320
the superposition also collapses if

289
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,160
there's an eavesdropper and that is why

290
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,720
it's called uh that you get the word

291
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,600
it's

292
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,680
um yeah it's called that you cannot

293
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,680
clone it

294
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,120
so if

295
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,000
eve interferes in the conversation and

296
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,760
tries to

297
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,200
eavesdrop

298
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,079
and measure the photon

299
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,800
the superposition collapses so if then a

300
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,760
bob will measure the same photon

301
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,600
it won't be in a superposition so bob

302
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
will know that someone else already

303
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,920
measured the photon

304
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,839
and probably the most interesting thing

305
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,399
is that it's using physics over math

306
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,760
as i mentioned

307
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,160
one at one point a quantum computer will

308
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,240
become so powerful that

309
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,560
it can easily factor

310
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,160
prime numbers as you currently use it

311
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,040
but you can obviously not factor

312
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,680
physics you cannot factor the state of a

313
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,040
photon

314
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,800
so that makes it much more

315
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,640
secure

316
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,720
as i mentioned there's also

317
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,279
a couple of challenges for example

318
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,120
decoherence

319
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,079
and the coherence describes

320
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,600
the ability

321
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,760
for a photon to maintain superposition

322
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,160
over time

323
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,519
so

324
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,320
that is also an issue the physicists

325
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,519
will need to

326
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,440
solve going forward

327
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,200
you cannot really store qubits for a

328
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,120
longer time

329
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,880
so this is only

330
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
really usable currently

331
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,839
for real-time

332
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,440
applications another challenge is the

333
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,079
fidelity fidelity describes basically

334
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:14,959
the

335
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,360
quality of the qubit

336
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,200
as i mentioned it

337
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,320
there are challenges when using a

338
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,959
quantum key distribution in

339
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,760
setups or networks where you use

340
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,880
dwm or cwm equipment

341
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,680
and so the quality drops dramatically if

342
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
you have other light sources for example

343
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,399
on the same fiber as well

344
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,639
and scaling is an issue scaling in

345
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,519
distance as i mentioned you cannot

346
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,000
amplify the signal so

347
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,240
currently

348
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,399
our current commercial available

349
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,040
qkd solutions are only

350
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,200
usable up to a

351
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,920
distance of around 120 140 kilometers

352
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,399
depending on the quality of the fiber

353
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,639
but also as you might have figured by

354
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,920
now it's

355
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,760
always a point-to-point system

356
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,320
so how do you scale this for example in

357
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,120
a

358
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,600
multi-point vpn

359
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,079
setup

360
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,120
so a term you might have

361
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,800
heard by now or

362
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,880
might have seen around this quantum

363
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,000
internet

364
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,959
or is it quantum networking so

365
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,720
let's see

366
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,480
about that as i

367
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,639
just mentioned already

368
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,040
basically a quan

369
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,120
there is no quantum internet currently

370
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,880
right a quantum

371
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,240
network

372
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,800
at max but that's basically a point

373
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,399
point connection uh using a dark fiber

374
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,199
um so it's it's in this case still

375
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,639
two end nodes um using an optical uh

376
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,480
connection or free space could be as

377
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
well using a satellite

378
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,839
um

379
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,480
but that is the state where we are so we

380
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,120
are still far away from a quantum

381
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,839
internet um in order to reach the state

382
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,279
where we could

383
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,760
talk about the quantum internet um we

384
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,480
need repeaters for example or

385
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,120
we need we need to be able to amplify

386
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,600
the signal so there's still quite a lot

387
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,320
of

388
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,560
challenges

389
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,000
one of the

390
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,079
things the physicists are currently

391
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,440
working on is what is called an

392
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,760
entanglement swap

393
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,760
basically

394
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,880
as to simply describe that is alice and

395
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,120
bob entangled to photons

396
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,040
as i just mentioned if you

397
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
bring those photons really close

398
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,199
together and you take them apart they

399
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,920
will have the same quantum state now if

400
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,800
bob and charlie do the same and then bob

401
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,880
does a so-called entanglement swap

402
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,839
action

403
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,399
then alice and charlie have entangled

404
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,839
photons

405
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,680
so that is a potential way to overcome

406
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,639
distance limitation

407
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,360
but this only currently works in

408
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,160
in the

409
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,560
labs of universities and

410
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,000
some commercial parties as well

411
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,519
so

412
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,199
we are still quite far from a quantum

413
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,519
internet and there's work going on in

414
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,360
itf in in etsy itu and another standard

415
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,800
organizations

416
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,040
and as you can see there's also already

417
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,000
sort of an oc model

418
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,040
but lots of it is still a theory

419
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,800
and so there's still lots of work to do

420
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,240
before

421
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,759
we'll see a quantum internet

422
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,880
and if at one point we'll see a quantum

423
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,040
internet um will probably look like

424
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,759
or

425
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,440
looks like a little bit as you can see

426
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,639
on the

427
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,720
on the drawing where a

428
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,800
endnote will have

429
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,639
two connections that could be over

430
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,959
shared fiber if we're at the point where

431
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,000
we can actually use cwd or dwdm

432
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,880
um

433
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,759
but um there will probably always or at

434
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,839
least in the near future you'll always

435
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,560
have a classical link and a

436
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,480
quantum link

437
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,160
as

438
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,800
as i mentioned we're currently in qkd

439
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,759
only

440
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,000
teleporting or transporting

441
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,839
quantum states

442
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,800
and

443
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,199
if you compare that to the evolution of

444
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,480
the internet

445
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,440
um this is at a point where once the

446
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,839
internet started we could send or we

447
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,399
tried to send login to the other site

448
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,639
and we were able to send the ldo and

449
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,440
when

450
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,199
they sent the g

451
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,519
the whole system crashed so this is

452
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,839
still much slower than

453
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,360
your old dial up modem for example

454
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,600
so for the short term

455
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,639
classical link will still carry the data

456
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,519
and quantum will only be used

457
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,600
for synchronization for

458
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,160
key distribution etc

459
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,759
obviously

460
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,120
there will be a point where

461
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,439
routers will also be able to

462
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,919
next to classical data also route uh

463
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,559
quant or have a quantum data plane

464
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,640
um but currently that is that is not

465
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,360
possible yet

466
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,959
um so some possible applications for

467
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,319
quantum in networking um

468
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,720
some of them i've mentioned already

469
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,599
um a a really good use case would be a

470
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,840
clock synchronization for example

471
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,960
um secure access to resources using

472
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,320
based on on key distribution for example

473
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,280
um obviously also communication between

474
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,880
quantum computers to

475
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,679
either transmit data or share a memory

476
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,760
for example

477
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,840
but the the

478
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,039
most

479
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,880
used and actually

480
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,480
most

481
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,960
or available solution currently is

482
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,200
quantum key distribution

483
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,880
there's a couple of vendors

484
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,000
we have commercial solutions um

485
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,799
you could you can actually buy ready and

486
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,600
integrate in in your networks

487
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,440
so let's see how

488
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,559
quantum key distribution works

489
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,000
how we use it

490
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,559
in in symmetric key cryptography how qkd

491
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,720
works and and how we can make it

492
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,480
applicable in

493
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,559
security mechanisms as we currently know

494
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,640
it

495
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,720
the biggest issue as i already mentioned

496
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,600
with

497
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,600
public key cryptography

498
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,120
is

499
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,160
how alice and bob are going to agree

500
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,360
and share

501
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,039
their pre-shared key

502
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,440
and as i mentioned

503
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,400
the

504
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,240
encryption and decryption of the data

505
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,840
itself is

506
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,200
already

507
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,400
a

508
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
quantum

509
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,360
resistant

510
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,160
because it's using aes 256 and you can

511
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,320
scale that up easily

512
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,400
but

513
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,559
the the sharing of the key itself is the

514
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,360
biggest issue

515
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,720
in public key cryptography

516
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,720
in symmetric key cryptography

517
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,760
you are unto insecure if alice and bob

518
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,600
have a way to

519
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,000
communicate the key between

520
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,200
each other in a safe way

521
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,400
and that is where the weakest link

522
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,120
of

523
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,160
symmetric

524
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,559
key cryptography is

525
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,240
so

526
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,440
as i mentioned um

527
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,840
current mechanisms to share that key

528
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,400
rsa diffie-hellman etc

529
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,120
are based on mathematics so at one point

530
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,960
as it is currently expected a quantum

531
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,240
computer

532
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,400
is powerful enough to factor

533
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,320
that key and so

534
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,640
our eavesdropper is able to

535
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,799
eavesdrop on the communication

536
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,679
um on the other hand the

537
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,160
symmetric cryptography mechanisms and

538
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,760
aes

539
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
which is being used in max second ipsec

540
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,440
is quantum safe

541
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,240
so now if we combine

542
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,880
quantum physics

543
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,120
so combining physics with

544
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,480
aes

545
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,720
we have a in theory

546
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,600
a secure way of communicating

547
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,799
so

548
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,799
let's use uh

549
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,240
maxeq or ipsec and use qkd to distribute

550
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,720
the keys

551
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,520
and in order to do so uh bennett and

552
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,640
bressard

553
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,440
came up with a protocol

554
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,240
or a mechanism to distribute those keys

555
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,480
leveraging

556
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,360
the

557
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,200
properties of quantum

558
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,159
and they came up with it in 1984

559
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,240
hence the protocol is called bb84

560
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,919
and how it

561
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,120
works is

562
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,799
on one side you have ellis and on the

563
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,480
other side you have bob

564
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,280
and they are using these polarized

565
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,559
photons

566
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,799
to communicate uh with each other

567
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,360
um then if you look at how it works um

568
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,320
alice

569
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
polarizes photons and

570
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,039
as you can see she does that in

571
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,559
sort of a random

572
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,480
way

573
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,000
and

574
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
the photon she's sending as a have a

575
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,880
polarization of 0 degrees 45 degrees

576
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,360
135 degrees then 45 degrees again

577
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,240
degrees etc

578
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,200
she does that over a dark fiber in this

579
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,960
case quantum channel

580
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,640
bob has a so-called photon detector

581
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,720
and reads

582
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,240
the state of the polarized photons

583
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,919
and then the next step is that

584
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,120
bob applies a random filter sequence to

585
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,919
measure the photons

586
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,360
and because he doesn't know

587
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,919
if alice has sent uh polaris photons in

588
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:02,720
uh

589
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,799
or in which polarization she sent the

590
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,919
photons he's applying random filters to

591
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,000
the photons he receives

592
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,640
um and as you can see

593
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,880
the first filter will pass

594
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,679
zero and 45 degree polarization

595
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,440
and the second filter will

596
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,240
will allow 45 and 135 degree

597
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,840
polarization etc

598
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,760
so they measure these photons

599
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,840
bob receives from alice

600
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,039
and

601
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,000
he

602
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,520
stores the result

603
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,320
then the next step is the allison bob

604
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,200
exchange the filters they've used

605
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,679
and now as you can see

606
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,080
in some cases there is a match if

607
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,480
they've used the same filter

608
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,200
and

609
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,480
the photon has passed the filter so for

610
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,679
example in

611
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,760
in the first photon

612
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,919
that has a zero degree polarization they

613
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,120
both use the filter that allows or

614
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,080
passes

615
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,440
zero degree or 90 degree polarization

616
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,159
so there's a match

617
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,880
they use a public data channel to

618
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,159
synchro or to share those filters

619
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,960
and basically if someone would eavesdrop

620
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,880
on that conversation you only have the

621
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,520
filters but you don't know which photons

622
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,200
have been sent the other way around if

623
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,799
you eavesdrop on the

624
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:28,320
quantum channel and you don't know the

625
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,559
filters that have been applied

626
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,640
it's useless that you might have

627
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,120
measured some of the photons

628
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,400
and the reason

629
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,840
why this

630
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,919
is so secure is because if there would

631
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,360
be an eavesdropper on the quantum

632
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,400
channel

633
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,880
um reading the photon stage the as i

634
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,480
mentioned the

635
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,320
quantum state

636
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,760
collapses so bob won't have any photons

637
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,360
to measure or at least he receives

638
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,559
photons

639
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,080
with a false quantum state

640
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,600
and as the filter is only applied after

641
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,880
bob

642
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,960
receives the photons and

643
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,600
he applies random filters

644
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,520
a potential eavesdropper doesn't know

645
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,200
which filters bob

646
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,840
have used so

647
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,919
that is why this is

648
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,159
inherent secure

649
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,480
now the next step is for

650
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,840
alice and bob to sift through the

651
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,880
results and as you can see

652
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,360
a key starts to appear

653
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,760
on the photons where they have applied

654
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,679
the same filter and that have passed the

655
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,039
filter

656
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,520
so in this case the key

657
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,600
both alice and bob

658
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,720
can use is zero one zero one

659
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,600
again this is a really short explanation

660
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
and there's a really good video on

661
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,919
youtube that describes this as well

662
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,000
and which is definitely worth watching

663
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,240
so

664
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,960
the next step obviously is that there's

665
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,880
two devices on lsite and bobsite that

666
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,240
actually have generated a key

667
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,440
and

668
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,080
the next step then is for our routers or

669
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
firewalls or servers to actually start

670
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,159
using that key

671
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,320
and that is um described in um

672
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,360
what is referred to as the etsy protocol

673
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,240
um etsy came up with or the etsy api i

674
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,559
should say she came up with a standard

675
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,080
for an api

676
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,039
um that can be used by

677
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,559
qkd

678
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,360
defenders and router vendors to

679
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,840
exchange that key material and fetch the

680
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,279
keys from

681
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,400
the qkd devices and use that in

682
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,279
security mechanisms

683
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,320
so if we walk through how that works

684
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,279
we have

685
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,960
alice on the left side bob on the right

686
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,320
side

687
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,360
and they want to use a quantum

688
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,080
key distribution to exchange a key and

689
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,360
use that in

690
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,679
a security mechanism

691
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,240
so both alice and bob have a qkd device

692
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,200
as i mentioned alice will generate and

693
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,600
send polarized photons over

694
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,840
a quantum channel to bob has a photon

695
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,600
detector and can read the states of the

696
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,480
of these photons both will also have a

697
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,559
router

698
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,600
that has a connection between them has a

699
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,720
connection

700
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,159
that could either be mexico or ipsec or

701
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,679
any other

702
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,200
security protocol

703
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,440
that obviously would allow for hitler

704
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,080
ski rollover as that is

705
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,240
one of the interesting things that

706
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,600
this qkd setup can generate

707
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,000
keys at a certain rate could be a couple

708
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,080
per second or um

709
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,000
or even more

710
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,640
um and so if you roll over the key

711
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,279
obviously fast enough for

712
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,960
the security protocol you're using it's

713
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,400
much harder to

714
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,520
intercept that communication

715
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,840
alice and bob also have between the qkd

716
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,240
devices a quantum channel that's used to

717
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,720
send the polarized photons and they have

718
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,600
a data communication channel that is

719
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,639
used to exchange

720
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,240
the filters

721
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,799
applied to the polarized photons

722
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,400
now if

723
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,960
alice and bob's routers want to start

724
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,000
using these quantum keys in

725
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,200
mexic

726
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,440
they start with doing a key request to

727
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,360
the qkd device

728
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,600
and the way that works is as i mentioned

729
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,200
the etsy

730
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,440
api so they send a call to um lsqd

731
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,600
device for key request

732
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,840
ellis receives a

733
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,480
key material and a key id

734
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,760
um

735
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,520
she sends she

736
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,559
she sends that key id to

737
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,480
the router on bob's side

738
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,880
bob can use the key id to request that

739
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,600
key from the qkd device

740
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,919
obviously he then receives hopefully the

741
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,600
same key

742
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,360
now both

743
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,039
start using that key

744
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,000
for their mech sec connection and

745
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,720
their traffic is secured using

746
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,360
qkd

747
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,440
there are some implementations of this

748
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:15,760
there already

749
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,559
some router vendors who have

750
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,440
built

751
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,159
scripts and etc to use this as far as i

752
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,200
know

753
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,279
there is no production code

754
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,240
yet

755
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,600
on a router fender side but

756
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,440
there's quite a few

757
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,880
vendors

758
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,039
of routing equipment but also optical

759
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,159
equipment

760
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,600
that are

761
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,360
testing with this and integrating this

762
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,279
now we'll hand it over to ashwin who

763
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,760
will walk you through

764
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,679
how this could work how some of the

765
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,360
configuration looks like and how this

766
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,559
looks on

767
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,760
cli to configure it

768
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,399
this is a demo on a quantum safe ip6

769
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,120
solution which is implemented as part of

770
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,440
a proof of concept

771
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,159
so this is the setup topology here we

772
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,000
use two srx 5k devices at both alice and

773
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,600
bob's side

774
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,279
we have a qkd out of band a network

775
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,640
so there is a

776
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,720
quantum key transmitter quantum key

777
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,960
receiver and there would be a channel

778
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,840
with which it generates a

779
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,600
a shared secret

780
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,919
so at alice side we request for a key

781
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,760
with the help of an https request

782
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,039
and we

783
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,520
then receive a key and key id from the

784
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,159
qkd device or quantum key distribution

785
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,679
device

786
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,799
alice keeps the key and shares only the

787
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,760
key id towards bob with the help of

788
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,240
some modifications in the existing i

789
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,840
feed to protocol

790
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,080
so as part of the ike negotiation we

791
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,399
also share the key id information

792
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,000
to its bob

793
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,200
so once bob receives the key id he can

794
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,279
use the key id to fetch the

795
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,440
corresponding key from the qkd device

796
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,480
so

797
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,640
key id is something which is uniquely

798
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,440
identifying each key since the qkd out

799
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,279
of band network can generate multiple

800
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,039
keys

801
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,559
so uh

802
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,799
now we have a symmetric key at both

803
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,399
alice and bob site and this key

804
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,640
can be mixed with the existing ipsec

805
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,120
sticky materials that is generated as

806
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,440
part of phi v2 protocol

807
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,080
and we have a final key material which

808
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,240
is meant to be quantum secure

809
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,919
and uh it is this new ip6 key material

810
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,120
that is used to establish ip6 tunnels so

811
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,960
that the tunnel is meant to be quantum

812
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,399
secure

813
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,200
so as part of this demo we would be

814
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,480
establishing ipsec a quantum safe ip6

815
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,440
tunnel

816
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,520
and we would pump bi-directional traffic

817
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,799
with the help of axia traffic generator

818
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,760
so it has two end points so from the

819
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,840
first end point

820
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:06,000
of exia we sent a traffic towards saa

821
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,760
which is then encrypted and uh send uh

822
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,919
the traffic towards a bo

823
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,519
via the tunnel

824
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,919
and once it is received at bob's side it

825
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,080
would be decrypted and sent back towards

826
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,399
the other end point of fixia

827
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,480
so we have another traffic item which

828
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,640
sends the traffic in the other direction

829
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,840
in the similar

830
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,039
in the similar fashion

831
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,480
so we also ensure that the traffic is

832
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,120
not impacted upon expiry of

833
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,960
the essays

834
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,320
so upon lifetime expiry we would request

835
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,360
for new keys from the qkd device

836
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,320
and it uh then offload the traffic from

837
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,399
all the tunnels towards the new tunnel

838
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,600
so here there are two windows open the

839
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,840
left side black windows for alice and

840
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,439
right side blue windows for bow

841
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,200
so we have ike and ip6 specific

842
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,600
configurations already done

843
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,760
and there is an additional knob added to

844
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,799
configure qkd specific information

845
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,240
so as part of the qkd profile we specify

846
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,919
the prsa id local sa id and the uri of

847
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:24,240
the corresponding query device

848
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,640
so it is this profile that is then

849
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,880
mentioned in the gateway configuration

850
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,640
which is the ike gateway configuration

851
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,840
so once we have such a profile mentioned

852
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,000
as part of the gateway configuration

853
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
this gateway is

854
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,919
considered to be a quantum enable

855
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,480
similarly uh this

856
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,320
a configuration a query specific

857
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,480
configuration is done at uh

858
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,080
bob site

859
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,799
where we have the qqd specific profile

860
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,640
and the profile

861
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,039
name is then mentioned as part of the

862
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,519
gateway configuration

863
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,159
so we already have the icon ipsec essays

864
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,799
established

865
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,519
so in order to

866
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,720
get a new i can ipsec essays and in

867
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,760
order to

868
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,640
get a new key from the qkd device we can

869
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,919
clear the existing essay

870
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,360
it takes some time to come up

871
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,360
yeah

872
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,440
now you can see the index has been

873
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,640
incremented from 110 to 111

874
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,799
for ikc and also

875
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,880
it has been incremented

876
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,000
for ipsec cases

877
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,399
so we can now check

878
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,120
the key id and key that is received from

879
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,239
the qkd device

880
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,039
for that i will search uh with a quantum

881
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,560
keyword

882
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,560
so here you can see

883
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,879
an http is a request that is sent from

884
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,320
the daemon in

885
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,800
our juniper router towards the qkd

886
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,000
device

887
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,159
uh in a format as per epsi specification

888
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,199
so in this https request we specify the

889
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,359
qkd server ip address prsa id and it is

890
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,440
with encryption keys

891
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,599
at the initiator site and we can also

892
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,440
specify the size of the key that is

893
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,280
needed and the number of keys

894
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,440
and this is the response from the qkd

895
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,918
device and the response contains a key

896
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,399
id and key

897
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,599
so we already have the initial ipsec key

898
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,839
material that is generated with

899
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,560
with ikev2 protocol

900
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,599
so

901
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,839
this key material is then mixed with the

902
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,079
key from the qkd device with the help of

903
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,480
a pseudo random function to generate a

904
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,240
final ipc key material so it is this ipc

905
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,079
key material that is considered to be

906
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,520
quantum secure which is then used to set

907
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,920
up ipsec tunnels

908
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,079
so if we search with the same key id at

909
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,760
bob's side we should see the same key

910
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,440
so i will then enlarge bob's window

911
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,800
so

912
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,320
this is an http request from uh

913
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,760
from the daemon running at bob's side

914
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,480
towards uh the qkd device

915
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,000
so it contains the key id

916
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,320
so this is a kid that was communicated

917
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,960
from alice to its book

918
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,720
via the ike v2 protocol

919
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,920
and we specify the qkd server ip address

920
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,720
and the prsa id

921
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,760
we then receive the corresponding key id

922
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,560
and key from the qkd device so it does

923
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,040
this key which is symmetric

924
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,280
at both the ends

925
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,760
and uh

926
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,320
so we have the initial key material that

927
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,040
is

928
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,200
then mixed with the uh the key from the

929
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,680
qkd device to generate a final ipc key

930
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,240
material

931
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,720
so uh so it is this a new or final key

932
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,560
material that is used to establish

933
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,800
tunnels so now we already have the

934
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,800
tunnels established we can now pump

935
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
traffic

936
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,000
so

937
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,240
i use ixia to generate traffic

938
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,720
now you can see the traffic is going

939
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,640
through with a negligible drop which you

940
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,839
can ignore it happens due to

941
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,040
since we have enabled some locks

942
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,520
so in order to check if the traffic is

943
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,440
going through the tunnels we can use

944
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,839
show security ip6 statistics output

945
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,680
you can see

946
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,400
the

947
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
encrypted and decrypted packets are

948
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,800
getting incremented

949
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,200
so we have a

950
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,480
a lifetime specified for i can ip

951
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,760
sequences so whenever the ike

952
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,240
lifetime gets expired

953
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,040
it

954
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,680
tries to do renegotiation and it tries

955
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,880
to fetch a new key from the qkd device

956
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,400
and uh

957
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,160
then it or

958
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,720
it establishes a tunnel

959
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,880
which is a backup tunnel

960
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,160
and uh

961
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,240
we then offload the traffic from old

962
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,400
tunnel towards the new tunnel

963
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,400
so you can see we initially had a and i

964
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,200
can say having index 113 and this was

965
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,160
the

966
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,000
timer expiry

967
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,400
so this is a hard lifetime there is an

968
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,880
internal lifetime called soft lifetime

969
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,920
so upon soft lifetime expiry it would uh

970
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,359
try to

971
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,119
create a backup tunnel and offload

972
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,119
traffic from old tunnel towards a new

973
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,720
tunnel

974
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,079
so now there is already uh the expiry

975
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,320
happen and it generated a new essay with

976
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,920
the new index

977
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,240
so whenever the ikc gets expired even

978
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,078
the ipsec essays would be renegotiated

979
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,280
so here we have specified the lifetime

980
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,119
as 180 seconds

981
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:07,280
which is three minutes

982
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,920
which is the minimum possible lifetime

983
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,640
and also the real frequency is set to

984
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,520
one so that every time the ik say

985
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,040
expires it does a re-authentication so

986
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,040
that it tries to fetch a new key from

987
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,119
the qkd device

988
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,520
so now you can see the traffic is not

989
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,880
impacted even after the lifetime gets

990
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,240
expired

991
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,680
from the essays

992
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,200
so that's all thank you

993
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:38,960
all right thank you joshua

994
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,440
as i mentioned this is not production

995
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,520
code yet but we developed this in order

996
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,640
to

997
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,200
learn for ourselves how it works and and

998
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,280
see how we can

999
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,800
use those qkb keys in

1000
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,599
in this case an ipsec

1001
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:57,920
other vendors have have similar

1002
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,760
implementations as well

1003
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,160
um so it's definitely worth checking

1004
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,319
that out if you're interested

1005
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,400
um so

1006
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,240
as i mentioned applicability uh the qkb

1007
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,960
is

1008
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,480
available from

1009
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,400
toshiba

1010
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,560
from ideoquantique there's a couple of

1011
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,920
vendors who

1012
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,800
actually sell these qkd boxes

1013
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,440
most of them expose the keys using this

1014
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,520
etsy rest api

1015
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,359
i've put the link up here to the

1016
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,319
specification there's also a few

1017
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,160
simulators available

1018
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,359
that

1019
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,359
either developed by the qk defenders or

1020
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,680
even freely available for you to test

1021
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,960
and expose the rest api so you can

1022
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,119
fetch the keys and get the key ids etc

1023
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,800
then

1024
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,079
come up with ideas how can we use qkd

1025
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,280
which security protocols i already

1026
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,839
mentioned the mexic ipsec

1027
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,920
but it could also for example be used in

1028
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,800
tcpao which allows for

1029
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,119
dynamic keyword over as well

1030
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:10,240
but there's also a couple of challenges

1031
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,280
still and and and things to solve right

1032
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,520
probably the biggest challenge is how to

1033
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,880
overcome the

1034
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,960
120 kilometer distance

1035
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,480
do we need quantum repeaters can we use

1036
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,040
some sd-wan kind of solutions is it

1037
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,759
satellites

1038
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,079
i know in china they're testing

1039
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,160
with satellites obviously you can spend

1040
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,520
much

1041
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,599
larger distances than

1042
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,079
120 kilometers over fiber

1043
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,079
but the downside obviously is that you

1044
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,880
need to put a dish on your office or

1045
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,520
a data center rooftop

1046
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,000
how can we leverage and use keys where

1047
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,160
there's no qkd

1048
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,720
devices present right can we

1049
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,720
for example for remote or home workers

1050
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,760
or maybe even mobile users

1051
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,040
and what about a multi-point qkdsi i

1052
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,440
mentioned all the qkd

1053
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,760
systems are basically a point point

1054
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,400
so can we do something with entangling

1055
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,200
more than two photons and

1056
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,160
or uh come up with with something smart

1057
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,000
so there's there's still quite a few

1058
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,920
challenges um and um

1059
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,599
but for some applications this is uh as

1060
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,960
i mentioned available so yeah feel free

1061
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,920
to to reach out there's here also some

1062
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,839
further reading as i mentioned there's

1063
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:37,280
work in

1064
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,680
several of the standards organizations

1065
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,280
there's the quantum internet research

1066
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,520
group in itf that is

1067
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,359
quite active and and some of the things

1068
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,920
are discussed here uh etsy is working on

1069
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,440
standardizing

1070
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,960
uh the protocol uh to uh fetch those

1071
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,760
keys from the qkd devices um

1072
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,560
itu is working on it

1073
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,359
there's lots of material from

1074
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,040
universities

1075
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,960
i'm based in netherlands so the

1076
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,480
university in delft for example is

1077
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,880
working on it but also universities in

1078
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,720
the us and and

1079
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,319
uk and in other

1080
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,880
countries

1081
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,520
other questions i can take questions now

1082
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,400
or feel free to reach out

1083
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,400
by email afterwards

1084
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,960
thank you very much

1085
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,200
do we have any questions for him

1086
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,280
so there's been this like boogie man of

1087
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,760
uh quantum computers forever like it

1088
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,920
keeps coming up is this thing

1089
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,560
is there like a timeline as to when you

1090
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,319
see it actually being a thing um in

1091
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,760
years or

1092
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,200
you said soon so i was wondering if you

1093
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,359
quantify that a little bit

1094
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,680
yeah excellent question so

1095
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,280
as i mentioned at the beginning of the

1096
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,720
presentation

1097
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,920
this

1098
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,520
what we just discussed

1099
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,079
isn't about quantum computers at all

1100
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:01,040
but

1101
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,560
obviously we're trying to protect

1102
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,680
against one computers to be honest

1103
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,640
i visited the labs at universities and

1104
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,720
and i've spoken with

1105
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,839
quite a few

1106
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,960
folks in in research

1107
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,119
quantum computers that are usable will

1108
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,800
be

1109
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,359
here earliest in 10 15 years probably

1110
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,200
so

1111
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,440
it's absolutely a fair question

1112
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,359
it is also a fair question than if we

1113
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,920
would need a qkd or

1114
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,800
a post quantum cryptography

1115
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,920
at all before that that time um i think

1116
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,000
it would be good to start looking into

1117
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,800
it as as we're doing um and and as we

1118
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,880
showed that at least you are aware of

1119
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,440
what the threats are and some of the

1120
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,960
options to uh

1121
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,800
protect your network but yeah quantum

1122
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,359
computers are still quite far out that's

1123
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,799
absolutely a fair question

1124
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,720
all right thank you so much melchior

1125
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,920
that's all the time that we have for

1126
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,839
questions

1127
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,590
all right thanks for having me

1128
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:10,579
