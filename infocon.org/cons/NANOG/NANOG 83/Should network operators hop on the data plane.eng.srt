00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,160
hello everybody my name is max griezing

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,480
i am from the university of twente

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,639
and i will hold the talk with the title

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,920
should network operators hop on the data

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,199
plane so let me first introduce myself

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,760
i am 26 years old i'm a german student

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,160
studying in the netherlands

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,080
and i finished my bachelor's in techno

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
computer science at the university of

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,279
tuente in last summer and since then i

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,558
am in my

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,320
yeah my master's also in computer

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,719
science with a specialization in data

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,760
science

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,559
and besides my study i work as a devops

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,640
engineer in part-time

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,960
and um well you have probably never

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,800
heard of my name before

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,160
so um let me explain how i ended up here

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,399
well my bachelor thesis or part of my

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,239
bachelor thesis was

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:54,960
the

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,440
assessment of the quality of

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,960
block list

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,520
to be precise the dataplan.org block

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,800
list

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,000
and

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,240
yeah i i discovered that there is some

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,720
room for improvement in this block list

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,320
and

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,240
the operator of this block list is john

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,119
kristoff he is also on the program

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,720
committee of nanak or a member of the

35
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,880
program committee and as soon as my

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,360
paper was published he uh contacted me i

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,479
was like

38
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,200
hi max i discovered that you're actually

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,240
found a flaw in my in my data in my data

40
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,759
plane service and i was like yeah i

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,320
found some some room for improvement so

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,960
um he was like okay can i have your data

43
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,360
i would like to assess this myself and i

44
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,439
was like here go ahead i sent him a

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,479
download link for the data he was um

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,520
basically

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,759
uh yeah checking it himself a few days

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,600
later he came back to me

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,240
and told me yeah i think you got a point

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,200
there

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,399
there is indeed some room for

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,920
improvement and uh yeah so we stayed in

53
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,680
contact we assessed the data a little

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
bit further and at some point he was

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
basically saying yeah i really like the

56
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,000
work that you've produced there and uh i

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,880
don't know

58
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,200
maybe maybe you can consider to submit a

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,479
talk to nanak

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,479
well you know i've i've never talked at

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,120
a conference before so i was like yeah

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,879
well

63
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,280
let's go for nanak it's a decent first

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,599
conference i guess so yeah i submitted

65
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,319
my talk it was accepted and here i am

66
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,920
but let's start with the with the actual

67
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,879
talk

68
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,120
so i'll first go through the background

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,080
um

70
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,239
i think most of you should be familiar

71
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,080
with internet scanners for those of you

72
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,400
who aren't um i'll quickly explain it so

73
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
an internet scanner is basically a piece

74
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,680
of software

75
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,480
that

76
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,440
scans a certain ip range for hosts which

77
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,959
are online

78
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,000
and

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
as soon as it discovers the host which

80
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,400
is online it tries to automatically

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,599
break into this host by for instance

82
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,640
exploiting common username and password

83
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,920
combinations

84
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,800
on the ssh service running on a host

85
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,560
and

86
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,720
yeah this this kind of bears a risk of

87
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,879
for intrusion and

88
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
you as network operators you can

89
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,560
basically

90
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,480
mitigate the risk of of such an

91
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,959
intrusion by integrating so-called ip

92
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,879
block lists in your firewall

93
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,680
so um nip block list is

94
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,200
basically a list of ip addresses

95
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
where someone has

96
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,319
identified this ip address as the origin

97
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,080
of internet scanning

98
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,120
and

99
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,080
yeah you

100
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,400
like when when your firewall receives

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,040
any request from one of those um

102
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,959
one of those uh

103
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,720
ip addresses then you can be pretty sure

104
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,239
it is a malicious

105
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,239
request so your firewall can just block

106
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,920
it or not answer it

107
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,120
and um

108
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,959
yeah as a cloudless provider you have an

109
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,640
interest to to

110
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,840
provide an uh an accurate or a complete

111
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,319
list of um scanner ip addresses in your

112
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,360
block list

113
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,319
and

114
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,480
thus you try to achieve

115
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,720
global diversity so you basically set up

116
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,879
a sensor infrastructure which is

117
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,799
globally distributed to find as many

118
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,000
scanner ips as possible and um yeah the

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,040
rise of of cloud providers made this

120
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,799
easy as the blockbuster provider so you

121
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,200
can easily set up honeypots all over the

122
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,839
world by using cloud services

123
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,880
and this brings me to my hypothesis so

124
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,240
i was asking myself if um

125
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,880
like if i was asking myself

126
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,680
that global driver or my hypothesis was

127
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,440
that global diversity

128
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,320
is insufficient to detect all scanners

129
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,639
if your entire sensor infrastructure is

130
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,240
purely cloud-based

131
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,800
so what does this actually mean

132
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,199
this actually means that my assumption

133
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,960
is that some scanners

134
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,960
do not target

135
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,479
cloud networks so some scanners

136
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,880
specifically target certain

137
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,759
um

138
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,600
hosts in certain networks so basically

139
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,280
they only attack residential area

140
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,360
networks or only attack isp

141
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,600
infrastructure so this is what i want to

142
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,199
investigate

143
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,479
and

144
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,520
yeah

145
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,240
the goal of my work was basically

146
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,880
to track scanners of different kinds of

147
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,759
networks and compare the origins of the

148
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,400
scanning activity so are the same

149
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,720
scanners actually targeting

150
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,039
hosts in residential area networks as

151
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,560
well as in cloud infrastructure for

152
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,840
instance

153
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,919
and this should ultimately answer the

154
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,600
question if the type of the network is

155
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,639
relevant

156
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,759
to identify different scanners

157
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,360
so to sum it up

158
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,440
if you're a blockless provider where do

159
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,280
you need to place your honeypot

160
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,720
to find as many scanners as possible

161
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,280
well to investigate this i was in need

162
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,960
of an infrastructure of the sensor

163
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,880
infrastructure myself

164
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,639
and so yeah i set one up and um

165
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,280
what i did i set up 11 honeypots in

166
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,120
three different kinds of networks so

167
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,320
three networks with different

168
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,039
characteristics i was operating three

169
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,240
honeypots

170
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,039
on the university campus network of the

171
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,880
university of twente

172
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,680
i was operating four hundred pots in

173
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,319
residential areas specifically in the

174
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,280
homes of some of my friends

175
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,600
and i was also operating four honeypots

176
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
in cloud infrastructure

177
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
to have some some baseline of data to

178
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,720
compare my findings to or to compare the

179
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,120
scanning activity to and i was using

180
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,880
three particular um

181
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
cloud service provider digitalocean

182
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,720
hedzner and myvps

183
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,520
um

184
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,039
and all of these honeypots all of these

185
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,000
11 honeypots were logging the data to a

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,319
central database server and the database

187
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,720
server was just um

188
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,840
yeah

189
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,759
basically reading the logs from each of

190
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,919
the honeypots and inserting it into the

191
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,919
database so it was parsing the log files

192
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,240
and inserting it into the database and

193
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
yet to to also assess

194
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,479
the quality of the dataplane.org block

195
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,360
list as previously said i was also in

196
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
need of the data that was on the data

197
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,639
feeds on

198
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,240
on dataplane.org so um on data plane or

199
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,919
data plane the data feeds on data plane

200
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,400
are updated once every hour so this was

201
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,560
also the time frame i have used for

202
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,680
myself what i did i set up a cron job

203
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,759
which was downloading the data feeds

204
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,400
once every hour and also this data was

205
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,720
in imported into the database

206
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,080
and then based on this resulting

207
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,479
database i uh yeah i performed my

208
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,639
evaluation

209
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,440
um so how did hani put or what are the

210
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,039
requirements for a honeypot in my work

211
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,000
in a honeypot needs to be available for

212
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,680
two weeks within may 2021 so my logging

213
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,560
period was set from the 17th to the 30th

214
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,800
of may and

215
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,960
as technical requirements it had to be

216
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,400
debian based so it had to operate on

217
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,080
i don't know debian

218
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,479
ubuntu derivative or

219
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,960
raspberry pi os or something like this

220
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,879
and this was you or this was necessary

221
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,039
because i well i was familiar with the

222
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,000
with the os and also um i was the need

223
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,199
of regular

224
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,280
services like the open ssh service and

225
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,720
the telnet service

226
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,039
um so these two were also operating on

227
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,800
each of the honeypots

228
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
and then

229
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,319
furthermore i wanted to investigate vmc

230
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,720
scanning activity as well however since

231
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,400
my honeypots were running without a

232
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,960
graphical user interface and vnc is the

233
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,479
graphical

234
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,879
protocol i kind of need an exotic

235
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,039
implementation and i found vnc serve a

236
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,719
vnc term on uh to be found on github um

237
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,719
and this didn't really deal well well

238
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,880
with the nightly lock rotation that i've

239
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,839
set up on the honeypot so

240
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,799
um

241
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,958
after a while all of my vnc services

242
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,720
basically crashed and didn't really

243
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,279
didn't start again so um from now on i

244
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,480
can only consider ssh and telnet data

245
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,720
but let's come to the results

246
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,959
so with these 11 honeypots

247
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,519
and a logging period of two weeks

248
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,279
i was um

249
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,240
getting an

250
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,040
uh i was ending up with 6.6 million

251
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,399
requests

252
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,480
from almost 7 200 different scanners i

253
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,320
will investigate this in terms of ssh

254
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,880
internet data so vnc data is not not

255
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,399
considered right now

256
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
and what did i do with the data

257
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,360
i tried to find geographical patterns

258
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,800
i also

259
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,959
briefly investigated the importance of

260
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,880
tour traffic in the domain of internet

261
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,160
scanning

262
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,720
and then i focused

263
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,959
or i tried to uncover some

264
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:31,760
um

265
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,160
temporal patterns

266
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,680
like some global temporal phenomena um

267
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,240
by investigating the num or the request

268
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,560
based on their utc timestamp

269
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,240
and then i investigated per local time

270
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,399
zone of the originating scanner ip

271
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:49,279
address

272
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,480
and lastly i also investigated the

273
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,320
coverage of those scanners that were

274
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,120
identified by my honeypots

275
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,320
and

276
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,800
the coverage of those scanners in the

277
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,000
dataplane.org feeds

278
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
um let's start with the geographical

279
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,000
activity of scanners um

280
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,640
on the bottom on the top we see telnet

281
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,440
data on the bottom we see ssh data on

282
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,320
the left a pie chart shows the number of

283
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,079
scanner ip addresses identified by

284
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,240
mahani pods and the right one the number

285
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,399
of requests that have arrived at those

286
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,480
honeypot so request is basically a login

287
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,600
attempt

288
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,320
and for telnet we see that

289
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,800
it is distributed globally

290
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,519
and in a sense we can say that each

291
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,240
country that has a so the the different

292
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,399
colors stand for different countries and

293
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,000
each country that

294
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,800
has a developed it infrastructure also

295
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,959
contributes to a certain amount of

296
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,600
telnet scanning and ssh shows the

297
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,680
different pictures so ssh is purely

298
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
dominated by chinese and us-based

299
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,959
scanners

300
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,480
and

301
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,279
yet

302
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,440
only chinese and us-based scanners

303
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,200
contribute to more than half of the

304
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,880
number of requests arriving at my

305
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,000
honeypots

306
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and what's even more interesting is that

307
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,040
the country with the third most number

308
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,000
of uh scanner ips is the netherlands a

309
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,240
teeny a teeny tiny country somewhere

310
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,519
here in europe

311
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,640
and

312
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,560
it's also interesting that it has a

313
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,120
particularly small number of requests

314
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,959
so keep that in mind we will investigate

315
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,240
this later but what we can say so far is

316
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,640
um telnet is distributed equally over

317
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,720
the globe

318
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,279
whereas ssh is

319
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,519
dominated by two countries china and the

320
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,399
us

321
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
and if we investigate the data in detail

322
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,240
then we actually see that chinese

323
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,519
scanners mostly target the honeypots

324
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,120
on university compasses and cloud

325
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,160
networks

326
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,519
so previous research has also shown that

327
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,760
china is somehow into intellectual

328
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,320
property so this might

329
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,000
might explain it

330
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,120
however the us or us-based scanners

331
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,600
target much more residential area

332
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,360
honeypots and then there is the

333
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,519
netherlands with plenty of scanner ip

334
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,200
addresses but very pure requests in

335
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,399
comparison

336
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,160
and this is what we what we investigate

337
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,480
right now so the netherlands is not only

338
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,639
known for its liberal drug policy

339
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,680
but also for its large tour community

340
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,480
and

341
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,040
what i did i downloaded the

342
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,000
ip addresses of the tor exit nodes and

343
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,160
compared it with a scanner ip address

344
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
and we see that quite a large number of

345
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,279
scanning ips are actually tor exit nodes

346
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,519
however very few requests are actually

347
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,440
sent from those tor exit nodes which

348
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,920
makes sense because routing over tor is

349
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,399
considerably slow

350
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,880
however if we inner join the

351
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,000
tor

352
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
exit node ip addresses from which

353
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,720
scanning activity originates with the

354
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,959
with the dutch ip addresses of the

355
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,120
identified scanners then we see that

356
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,399
quite a portion

357
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,959
of those scanners are actually

358
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,680
to our exit nodes so this explains the

359
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,079
large number of dutch scanner ip

360
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,839
addresses with very few requests

361
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,920
okay let's continue with the temporal

362
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,120
analysis

363
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,519
um the idea was that we just discover

364
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,519
patterns in terms of the day of the week

365
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,240
or maybe differences between weekday

366
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,720
scanning and weekend scanning however we

367
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,600
could not really find a weekly pattern

368
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,839
but if we consider the hour of the day

369
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,399
of the utc timestamp of the request then

370
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,120
we see that there are slight peaks

371
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,040
um during certain hours of the day and

372
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,720
those are highlighted with a white

373
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,040
background here on the right on the

374
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,720
graph on the right

375
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,079
and this

376
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,480
brings us the idea maybe we do not need

377
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,240
to search for global

378
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,480
temporal phenomena but actually local

379
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,519
ones

380
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,000
so what if those peaks are related or

381
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,600
what if those peaks are related to the

382
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,160
local time of the of the scanners and

383
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,040
this is what we're doing right now

384
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,600
so here we have depicted three um

385
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,320
example time zones for ssh internet so

386
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,240
the time zones are of no importance but

387
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,839
what we what i want to show is the

388
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,600
observations that we make

389
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,519
and um as

390
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,360
darker this the background of the

391
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,360
sellers as more requests are um

392
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,680
were performed within this hour of the

393
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,440
day of the local time zone of the

394
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,600
scanner and we can clearly see that

395
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,040
there is kind of a

396
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,279
baseline or a base load of scanning

397
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,079
activity which is uh which operates all

398
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,160
around the clock and during certain

399
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,160
hours of the local time there are

400
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,440
certain peaks

401
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,959
and

402
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,519
we we figured that those can be caused

403
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,480
by um scanners which are fully automated

404
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,600
running 24 7 for the entire year so

405
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,360
those contribute to the base load and

406
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,959
then when the bad guys are actually

407
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
online and in front of their screen then

408
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,360
we see a peak and scanning activity

409
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,600
which is related to human-initiated

410
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,720
scanning

411
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,519
so this is what we see

412
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,839
from this

413
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,519
data and then let's let's continue with

414
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,199
the coverage of the data plan feed so

415
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,199
basically that part of data that brought

416
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,199
me here or that part of the of the work

417
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,880
that brought me here i will first

418
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,680
investigate ssh and then telnet data

419
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,880
so when considering the coverage of the

420
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,240
s of the ssh scanner ip addresses with a

421
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,560
data plane features then we we like

422
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,920
let's first

423
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,760
consider the number of scanners that

424
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,000
have arrived at the honeyput so we see

425
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,880
that

426
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,680
um

427
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,800
3

428
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,600
700 honeypot 3700 scanner ips were

429
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
attacking my honeypots in cloud and

430
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,160
compass area networks and in comparison

431
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,120
only 875 scanners have actually attacked

432
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,800
honey pots in my residential area

433
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,759
networks

434
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,600
so there is quite a difference between

435
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,440
cloud and campus scanning and

436
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,680
residential area network scanning

437
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,959
and um but what we are interested in are

438
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,120
not those scanners which target maybe

439
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,880
cloud and compass networks what we are

440
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,600
interested in are scanners which target

441
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,680
exclusively honeypots in one certain

442
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,199
kind of network and this is what we're

443
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,519
doing right now so we we basically

444
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,000
consider only those scanners which

445
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,839
um

446
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,040
exclusively show up in the lot data of

447
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,759
honey pots in only cloud net like only

448
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,920
in the in the cloud honeypots or only in

449
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,680
the campus honeypots or only in the

450
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,040
residential um area honeypots

451
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
and we see that um

452
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,320
for cloud and compost um

453
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,480
uh honeypots we see that the the scanner

454
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,759
ips

455
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,279
identified by these honeypots are

456
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,240
actually covered by ninety percent

457
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,399
in the data plan or org feeds however

458
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,320
for scanners that target only

459
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,399
residential area hunting ports we see

460
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,800
that those show up to an extent of just

461
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,120
29 on the data plane feed so we see

462
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,360
indeed that scanners which target

463
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,880
certain kinds of network do not

464
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,639
necessarily show up

465
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,759
on the data plane or on the um on block

466
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,079
lists from data from block list

467
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,240
providers which have all of their sensor

468
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,639
infrastructure in the cloud

469
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,399
so let's consider the telnet scanning

470
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,199
activity um first of all what we see is

471
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,319
that the share of um

472
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,160
telnet scanners is distributed rather

473
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,520
equally so

474
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,280
around 400 scanners have arrived at each

475
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,359
at the honeyputs of each type of the

476
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,480
network so um yeah

477
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,520
400 at my cloud honeypots 400 scanner

478
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,000
ips and my compass honeywatts and 400 in

479
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,679
the residential area 100

480
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,679
and what's even more interesting is if

481
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,840
we consider only those sandy puts only

482
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,760
those scanners which exclusively target

483
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,320
the tiny ports in these networks and we

484
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,559
see that 97 percent and each type of

485
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,120
network exclusively target sunny pots in

486
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
this in this area

487
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,400
um

488
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,320
or in this type of network

489
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,120
and

490
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,799
what's also interesting is that the

491
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,919
coverage

492
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,799
um of those honeypots on the

493
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,679
dataplane.org feeds

494
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,320
is ranges from seven to fifteen percent

495
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,240
which is much much smaller in comparison

496
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,240
to the ssh

497
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,760
scanner

498
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,919
and what what we can conclude from this

499
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,200
is basically

500
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,080
maybe

501
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,200
um

502
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,559
maybe telnet scanning is distributed um

503
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,679
globe globally much more diversely so

504
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,160
what what we basically see is that it is

505
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,480
harder to grasp or harder to identify

506
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,160
telnet scanners since um yet maybe those

507
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,480
are just uh yeah

508
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,200
globally operating botnet scanners that

509
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,080
um

510
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,840
are

511
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,000
so um distributed that it is hard to or

512
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,039
that one scanner never actually targets

513
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,600
more than just one honeypot um

514
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,000
out of my 11 honeypots for instance

515
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,160
um so yeah the idea is that that telnet

516
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,799
scanning is indeed or

517
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,039
might indeed be distributed globally

518
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:45,840
much

519
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,400
much more diversely and maybe it is

520
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,200
related to iot botnets like mirai botnet

521
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,600
or one of those derivatives

522
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,760
so this is what we can see from the from

523
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,520
telnet scanning and once again the

524
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,000
coverage is also much smaller on the

525
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,440
dataplane.org

526
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,360
data so um

527
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,440
it is indeed harder to grasp

528
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,799
and what we have seen so far is

529
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,039
basically um if if a scanner shows up so

530
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,520
if one if if one of my honeypots has

531
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,160
identified a scanner

532
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,919
does it show up in the dataplan.org

533
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,799
feeds and if so to what extent and what

534
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,039
we investigate right now is the time it

535
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,080
takes until it shows up so we we

536
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,880
consider the moment one of my honeypots

537
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,280
has identified a new scanner

538
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,360
and the number of days passed until it

539
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,120
actually also shows up on the

540
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,880
dataplane.org feeds

541
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,360
and what we see is

542
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,200
that indeed

543
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,559
within the first 12 to 48 hours the vast

544
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,919
majority of

545
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,160
ssh scanners also show up on the

546
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,880
dataplan.org feeds which is

547
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,760
actually quite a great result so

548
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,280
whenever a scanner attacks a honeypot or

549
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,600
whenever a scanner attacks a host it it

550
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,679
might most likely show up within the

551
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,840
next 48 hours on the data plane.org

552
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,000
feeds however if we consider telnet

553
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,200
scanners then it takes actually days

554
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,840
so if one of my honeypots has identified

555
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,760
a new telnet scanner it takes

556
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,559
if it shows up it takes days until it

557
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,000
actually shows up on the data plane or

558
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,200
org feeds so it once again confirms that

559
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,039
telnet scanning is much

560
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,360
um harder to to to identify

561
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,200
and so yeah those were basically the

562
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,720
results so far of my work and since john

563
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,840
kristoff contacted me we were um yeah we

564
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,640
were

565
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,120
um basically updating some things and

566
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,799
investigating some more things and this

567
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,799
is what i want to present right now

568
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,200
so first of all in the database we

569
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,440
actually saw that um

570
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,240
we have some bogus ip addresses in there

571
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,480
so a host can never have a bow with ip

572
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,799
address which means a bogus ip address

573
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,039
can never actually um

574
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,600
account for any requests however those

575
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
bogus ip addresses in my database

576
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,960
account for three percent of the

577
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,159
requests

578
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,400
and uh well we had to investigate it and

579
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,360
we actually discovered that um some of

580
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,600
my honeypots or the telnet d service on

581
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,080
some of my honeypots was configured such

582
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,559
that it actually locked the reverse dns

583
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,280
entry into instead of its ip address

584
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,320
and

585
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,159
yeah as i said the parser for the log

586
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,200
data was written by myself so

587
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,840
the regular expression was sometimes

588
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,320
finding an ip address within this rdns

589
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,280
entry

590
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,039
and was

591
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,960
like wrongly using this as the ip

592
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,120
address so this accounts for

593
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,360
approximately 5.7

594
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,559
of all scanner ip addresses

595
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,840
so this is one of the of the like yeah

596
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,559
one weakness of the data set um

597
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,320
and then further we compared like

598
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,159
after john kristof contacted me we

599
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,480
actually investigated a little bit more

600
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,760
um what happens on the data plane site

601
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,559
and as i said my logging period was for

602
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,880
two weeks within um

603
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,720
within may 2021 and he extended this

604
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,600
time frame by one week earlier up to one

605
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
week later so we ended up with a total

606
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,799
period or total time frame of four weeks

607
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,039
and he was basically considering the

608
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,880
historical data of the data plane feeds

609
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,400
for four weeks

610
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,280
and

611
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,679
within these four weeks

612
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,840
we saw that data plane

613
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,559
or the data plane feeds have identified

614
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,600
almost 100 000 different

615
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,000
scanning ip addresses

616
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,799
and

617
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,600
in comparison my honeypots have within

618
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,440
two weeks have identified seven thousand

619
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,240
four hundred ips however

620
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,600
still not in the dataplan.org feeds were

621
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,000
one thousand nine hundred ip addresses

622
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,480
and john kristoff argues well

623
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,919
i have 100 000 scanner ip addresses and

624
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,400
you only found 2 000 which did not show

625
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,880
up so it's basically less than two

626
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,240
percent um and and i was saying well

627
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,480
you have 300 honey puts

628
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,720
i have just 11 and i already discovered

629
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,159
1 900 not in your feed so what what what

630
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,320
would we actually have if i have 300

631
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,799
honeypots however i leave the judgment

632
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,240
to yourself

633
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,120
um

634
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,280
but yeah so

635
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,960
this is basically the comparison to the

636
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,039
data plane feeds

637
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,320
and um

638
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,960
yeah what we can conclude is um

639
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,320
that scanners indeed target different uh

640
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,960
kinds of networks or specific

641
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,760
scanners indeed target specific networks

642
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,400
and telnet and ssh scanning is of a

643
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,240
completely different nature so telnet

644
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,320
seems to be much more distributed

645
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,480
um but the most important message that i

646
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,640
want to communicate with you today is

647
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,960
that if you're a blockless provider and

648
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,640
you want to identify

649
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,799
as many scanners as possible

650
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,760
then

651
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,520
do not only consider global diversity

652
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,520
but also consider a qualitative

653
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,240
diversity of networks where you need to

654
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,159
place your own inputs

655
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,559
well with this slide i want to thank you

656
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,720
i want to specifically thank

657
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,000
john christoph

658
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,360
for supporting me and for inviting me to

659
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
submit my talk to nanook

660
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,520
and also for providing some insights to

661
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,200
the dataplane.org

662
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,559
infrastructure

663
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,720
and if you have any questions feel free

664
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,159
to ask

665
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,000
and or to contact me

666
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,559
thank you very much

667
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,679
oh we got one online here from gus

668
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,799
how much did you invest time and money

669
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
well um

670
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,760
money was actually considerably cheap

671
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,880
because it was a bet or like this work

672
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,159
was basically the um result of my

673
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,080
bachelor project

674
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,679
and

675
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,120
yeah regarding the

676
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,440
uh honeypots running on the university

677
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,159
compass and in um

678
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,840
residential area networks those were

679
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,919
basically just running raspberry pi's or

680
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,679
services of my friends which were online

681
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:12,799
anyway

682
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,159
so um i wasn't paying for this and

683
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,440
regarding the four cloud honeypots i was

684
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,440
setting up one myself on the hebson

685
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,080
cloud which was uh just i think for the

686
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,720
entire time of two weeks online was it

687
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,480
around two euros

688
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,919
and the other ones were actually

689
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,880
sponsored by uh the university

690
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,279
and uh one was sponsored by my friend

691
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,080
like by a friend of mine um

692
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,799
and yeah in terms of money it was for

693
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,120
myself just two euros in total i guess

694
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,559
something like 20 euros for the two

695
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,279
weeks of logging data vlogging time and

696
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,640
in terms of time this entire project was

697
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,840
um going on for 10 weeks

698
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
and

699
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,080
um yeah setting everything up was uh yes

700
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,840
quite some work because it was hard to

701
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,559
actually find all of the people um who

702
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,720
can operate a honeypot for me like

703
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,080
especially if you want to convince

704
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,760
someone yeah do you want to host a

705
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,440
vulnerable service within your home

706
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,919
network for me for some research

707
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:14,720
um

708
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,640
so this took actually some time and then

709
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,320
the daily valuation was something like

710
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,279
um

711
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,120
four to five weeks in total in

712
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,600
continuous um

713
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,640
exchange with my supervisor so it as i

714
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,240
said in total including writing the

715
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,640
paper it was 10 10 weeks work

716
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,039
excellent we have a question from the

717
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,320
audience

718
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,760
go ahead sir

719
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,400
darryl buddick sba edge max i was

720
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,320
wondering if you did any further

721
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,799
correlation of the sources uh in

722
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,799
relation to your targets did you see if

723
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,559
some were coming from residentials

724
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,200
clouds very specific cloud providers or

725
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,840
universities

726
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,320
uh no i did not investigate this so what

727
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,640
like the focus of my work was basically

728
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,760
um

729
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,240
comparing the scanners which arrived at

730
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,200
residential area honeypots cloud

731
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,039
cloud honeypots and um

732
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,520
and compass area honeypots but i did not

733
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,679
investigate um where the scanners are

734
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,159
coming from

735
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,840
possibly another interesting angle to

736
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,120
look at

737
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,200
thank you i absolutely absolutely agree

738
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,399
with you we have another question online

739
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,360
uh it goes it's from jeff

740
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,960
with a g

741
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,760
you infer the scanner is aware of

742
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,720
type

743
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,760
of address campus residential et cetera

744
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,840
have you compared the data against the

745
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,159
broad range of honey pots

746
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,840
that allow

747
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,080
a larger range

748
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,720
a larger address range

749
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,200
that is untyped or the scanner are the

750
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,159
scanners the same

751
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,760
i know i also didn't investigate this so

752
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,720
um

753
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,159
as like

754
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,840
there are still a couple of things that

755
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,000
i would like to investigate as soon as i

756
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,360
have some time so the data is still

757
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,360
available and if you want just contact

758
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,120
me i can i can provide you a download

759
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,960
link um so

760
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,880
what i actually did is i i was only

761
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,600
considering the um

762
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,520
the the type of type of network

763
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,440
basically i i mean i also compared some

764
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,240
honeypot um or the scanning activity of

765
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,080
honeypots within a certain type of

766
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,559
network and those also gave some

767
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,440
insights um but yeah those those results

768
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,440
are all on the paper um

769
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,240
so

770
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,760
maybe just search for the paper should

771
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
network operators up on the

772
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,240
um on the data plane then you find some

773
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,640
more insights but i yeah

774
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,559
sorry that i couldn't give actually a

775
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,240
more precise answer to your question i

776
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,080
hope this anyway answers it somehow

777
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,760
excellent we have

778
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,080
28 seconds and one last person in the

779
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,799
audience hi zach zach is with code 42

780
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,039
did you consider the possibility that uh

781
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,240
during your collection period

782
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,399
the data feed block list may have been

783
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,360
actively

784
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,399
used

785
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,640
by your upstream providers

786
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,000
and how that might skew the data

787
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,720
what exactly do you mean they might be

788
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,600
used by my own

789
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,720
potential sources of the scanning if if

790
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,440
the blacklists were in use actively

791
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,279
just wondering how that okay so you mean

792
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,520
if an isp for instance just blocks

793
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
incoming data from the block list

794
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,960
um

795
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,640
i actually did not consider this that's

796
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,760
a pretty good point but

797
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,880
personally i wouldn't i wouldn't

798
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,000
necessarily expect it because um

799
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,840
you have first of all i mean the cloud

800
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,760
the cloud9 pods that i was using it

801
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,200
wouldn't make sense in my opinion to

802
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,600
actually block any incoming requests

803
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
specifically one if you want to set up a

804
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,960
service which

805
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,279
is kind of used for such research

806
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,440
and yeah regarding i mean university

807
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,600
campus networks are usually quite rather

808
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,760
liberal um so i don't think that there

809
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,640
is

810
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,600
any

811
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,080
block um blocking happening and yeah

812
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,440
regarding the home networks i can't

813
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,000
really argue i'm not so sure how liberal

814
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,480
the uh dutch isps are

815
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,240
sir thank you

816
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,640
excellent you're welcome thank you max i

817
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,960
appreciate it and if we can get a round

818
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,840
of applause for max

819
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,760
thank you very much and also john

820
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,159
kristoff for uh encouraging to do it too

821
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,040
thank you john

822
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,339
