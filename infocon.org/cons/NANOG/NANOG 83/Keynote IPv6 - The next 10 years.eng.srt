thousand

59
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,320

wednesday the last day on analog is

68
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,720
tough slot to compete with

69
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,800
mostly hangovers i assume but i'm glad

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,400
to see there's a lot of people in in the

71
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,520
room here

72
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,239
i will do my best to not bore you

73
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,560
when i was talking to alex and tina and

74
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,680
others about

75
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,760
you know the invitation to come here

76
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,440
and they said hey you know you wanna you

77
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,519
wanna do a talk at anagen and then they

78
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,720
i think the suggestion was v6 i said

79
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
really

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,879
we're

81
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,720
we're still talking about v6 i haven't

82
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,440
touched anything v6 in five years

83
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,200
so i was like okay so what do you guys

84
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,120
want to talk about you know so

85
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,640
went back and forth with alex you know

86
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,560
he was also very tolerant of delayed

87
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,319
email responses

88
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,239
and you know we came up with what we're

89
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,440
going to talk about today so i'm going

90
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,720
to break

91
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,519
you know today up in three three pieces

92
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,519
of the conversation a little history

93
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,400
for those of you who um

94
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,000
you know may need a little bit of a

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
refresher or some intro talk a little

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,200
bit about the current state of affairs

97
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,120
and then we'll we'll dive into

98
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,599
what we think maybe will be the next 10

99
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,560
years

100
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,440
um

101
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,760
hopefully not 20. and if if it is 20

102
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,360
then hopefully i don't have any gray

103
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,519
hair by then um

104
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,560
so

105
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,920
the

106
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,760
ultimately what prompted the kind of the

107
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,280
request to valerie from work to take

108
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,120
questions today is i i had lunch with

109
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,040
some folks yesterday and we were kind of

110
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,799
going over some of these things and

111
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,159
there was the sentiment that there would

112
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,519
be some interesting topics of

113
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,879
conversation amongst the community here

114
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,560
as far as what happens next

115
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,200
you know from a v6 perspective

116
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,599
so what i'm going to do is kind of give

117
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,280
you a little bit of background i'm not

118
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,680
not here to try to convince you to do

119
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,599
anything you don't want to do

120
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,400
um

121
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,280
hopefully that was never the case

122
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,439
um not here you know the sky is not

123
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,799
falling i'm not here to give you a pep

124
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,959
talk by any stretch of imagination um i

125
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,280
have nothing to pep you up about at the

126
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,319
moment

127
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,159
and and i hope

128
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,920
the next time i come back here i could

129
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,239
do something with bert from yesterday

130
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,159
about decentralized networking

131
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,400
blockchain cryptocurrency something like

132
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,560
that and we're not talking about v6 but

133
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,600
for now

134
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,040
let's talk about let's dive into v6 so

135
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,360
so this is not a pep talk absolutely not

136
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,720
um but we are going to talk a little bit

137
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,400
about history

138
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,479
so this whole

139
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,080
you know preparing for this kind of took

140
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,240
me down memory lane back to 2011

141
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,720
2012 hanging out with some of the best

142
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,360
friends i've ever made in this industry

143
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,680
all over the place silicon valley the

144
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,160
ice talk people yahoo google facebook

145
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,040

truth be told many of us were working on

149
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,479
b6

150
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,919
five six years before this

151
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,960
and i mean it's it's taken that long in

152
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,639
some in some ways

153
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,800
we've

154
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,199
further googling i probably you know

155
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,120
really got to know john curran and aaron

156
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,400
the iron crew about 17 years ago

157

2011 rolls around six years later we're

167
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,440

170
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,000

171
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,759
for you know internal management

172
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,039
purposes you know getting infrastructure

173
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,360
ready this was a game changer here where

174
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,479
we really started to kind of lay the

175
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,600
groundwork to take v6 to people right

176
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,199
and use it for other things that were

177
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,520
you know what i'll call broadly internet

178
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,600
facing

179
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,479
but

180
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,360
what

181
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,039
we've found

182
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,800
over the years what i've found over the

183
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,360
years is that adoption varies

184
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,560
dramatically

185
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,639
like beauty in the eye in the eye the

186
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,479
beholder right it doesn't mean the same

187
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,800
thing to everybody right so

188
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,319
early days you know there was

189
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,000
you know the intent to

190
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,319
leverage v6 to you know

191
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,680
manage a network

192
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,960
um

193
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,759
you know infrastructure what have you um

194
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,600
you talk to different people like paul

195
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,520
saab at facebook and what they've done

196
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,360
cameron burn at t-mobile

197
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,240
um

198
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,600
you know all different use cases all

199
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,160
different adoption models um look across

200
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,039
the broadband industry same deal right

201
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,280
so i i as i as i thought about today

202
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
you know this

203
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,039
yeah as i reflected became something

204
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,319
that i thought was pretty important to

205
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,000
kind of just highlight for folks as to

206
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,840
really what

207
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,160
different folks his motivations were and

208
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,120
are for v6

209
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,360
a little bit of history i promise i will

210
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,720
not belabor this all the slides are

211
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,000
available you guys can look at this

212
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,599
separately but i will touch

213
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,520
tips of waves here

214
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,280
i wish jeff was here

215
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,560
you know

216
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,319
not only because he's an amazing speaker

217
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,520
but he is just

218
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,199
you know jeff houston from ap the data

219
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,919
he makes available is you know amazing

220
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,520
so i'm plagiarizing jeff but i'm doing

221
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
my best to acknowledge

222
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,759
if you look at this growth you know from

223
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,039
you know the past

224
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,160
you know i guess he's been tracking this

225
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,759
since you know 2014

226
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,240
huge growth across adoption and when i

227
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,680
look at jeff's graphs here this is

228
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,360
really about broadband it's about the

229
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,120
eyeballs right

230
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,280
but the interesting thing about

231
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,960
his information

232
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,479
and maybe he's online hopefully he'll

233
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,080
comment if he is

234
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,199
um

235
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,080
by these numbers globally 100 adoption

236
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,599
happens in 20 years

237
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,800
i really hope we're not talking about

238
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,280
this in 20 years

239
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,280
if you go to the us view that's seven

240
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,720
we'll talk a little bit about

241
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,080
what that means here in a minute when it

242
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,680
comes to

243
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
v4 but

244
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,400
either way um

245
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,879
we still have a ways to go um but what

246
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,960
you'll see here in subsequent slides is

247
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,560
there's been a lot of progress made over

248
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,039
the past many years i mean in particular

249
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,919
since you know 2011 2012.

250
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:08,879
um

251
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,400
but when i sat back and did the math

252
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,879
and i hope somebody asks or has maybe

253
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,800
has some insight around the decline here

254
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
because if you go

255
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,720
back to the global view

256
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,080
there's some flattening if you go to the

257
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
us view here it's slightly on the

258
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,360
decline i think that's worth a

259
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,560
conversation

260
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,319
but i don't know if it's really like

261
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,560
worth spending the rest of the

262
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,399
the time talking about but it is worth a

263
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,559
chat

264
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,519
so

265
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,679
when we revisit motivations

266
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,279
it's everything from

267
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,679
is there enough v4 how much does it cost

268
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,799
i was talking to a friend of mine this

269
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,240
morning over breakfast

270
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,040
and we were talking about the cost of e4

271
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,399
i remember when we were talking about

272
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,959
the cost being like 10 bucks an address

273
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,800
we'll get we'll get to that in a minute

274
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,959
because like my mind was blown when i

275
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,240
saw some of the some of the recent

276
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,279
figures

277
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,560
and then there are some folks who are

278
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,360
just looking at v6 because they have so

279
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,040
many endpoints

280
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,640
attached to the network it just doesn't

281
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,959
make any sense to use anything else and

282
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,800
in particular when

283
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,120
you know the the ip connectivity is for

284
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,800
managed purposes

285
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,839
you could talk about performance you

286
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,440
could talk about end to end i remember

287
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,480
back in 01 0203 we were talking about

288
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,000
you know v6 we're going to connect

289
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,360
everything at the end

290
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,160
yeah

291
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,839
it's cute

292
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,320
maybe true in some ways maybe not but it

293
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,880
all depends right there there has there

294
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,080
have been

295
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,600
evidence there has been evidence about

296
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,440
performance improvements

297
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,880
i just don't know if

298
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,080
if it's enough to move the needle i

299
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,600
don't know if it matters

300
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,680
uh it's really a top few that are kind

301
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,360
of making a difference here for for us

302
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
here today i think that's why we're here

303
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,519
today right

304
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,720
content i'll cruise through this

305
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,640
google's view of the world you know of

306
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,720
of things that are connected to it over

307
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,760
v6 it's pretty good pretty good looking

308
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,440
chart growth wise

309
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,959
uh the debbie downer in me says wow 27

310
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,320
years for google to get to 100 percent

311
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,640
facebook globally

312
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,720
18 years

313
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,279
u.s eight all right i'll still be i'll

314
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,240
still be alive new year's

315
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,720
and then

316
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,959
there are other views right so google

317
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,600
facebook others actively report on what

318
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
they see right but the interesting thing

319
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,360
is when you look at the top ten carriers

320
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,760
uh that each of these folks put data

321
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,480
um as far as the consumers traffic the

322
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,880
percentage is high right so you're

323
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,000
talking like

324
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
top you know top 10 isps range anywhere

325
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,839
from 61 to 77 percent some are in excess

326
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,880
of

327
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,279
90 it's crazy

328
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,959
so what's the problem

329
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,920
like

330
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,519
why am i here

331
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,320
honestly um you know i'm sure patrick

332
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,399
will heckle me later

333
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,519
him and him and tigger here right

334
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,440
you know thank you patrick for lending

335
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,640
me him

336
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,560
um

337
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
and uh so why are we here right so so

338
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,959
the reality check

339
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,119
51 bucks an address is that real

340
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,440
good lord

341
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,600
got in the wrong business man

342
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,880
so uh that's that's staggering i

343
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,320
remember we were talking about addresses

344
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
being like you know 10 bucks and

345
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,720
12 bucks or whatever that blew my mind

346
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,240
right there when i started things i

347
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,680
haven't like i said i haven't touched

348
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,160
anything v6 related in five years

349
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,760
so of course i didn't care how much

350
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,839
before addresses cost either

351
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,480
until i saw that i was like

352
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,800
wow

353
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,600
eye-opening uh so thanks to to the folks

354
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,920
there and you know for for all the the

355
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,279
artwork there on the right again more

356
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,560
plagiarism

357
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,880
with acknowledgements um but that was a

358
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,480
real real eye opener

359
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,279
and

360
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,399
you know

361
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,120
on the heels of today into tomorrow with

362
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,200
the iron crew we'll talk you know maybe

363
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,279
there'll be some commentary around v4

364
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,639
availability but i mean let's be honest

365
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,920
guys i mean they

366
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,399
they'll that will eventually start to

367
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,399
win off and you'll have piles of v4

368
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,720
addresses in different places sure

369
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,880
um but they're they're just you know

370
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,560
it's a limited supply as it always has

371
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,079
been right

372
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,600
so the v6 reality so i'm going to shift

373
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,880
gears a little bit here so that's that's

374
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,320
the history lesson

375
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,920
hopefully i'm staying

376
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,519
ahead of schedule here

377
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,920
otherwise i'll get the hook later

378
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,440
so we're going to talk a little bit this

379
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,480
will be our transition to

380
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,560
the next 10.

381
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
so we got to be six

382
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,600
globally two sites are 100 music enabled

383
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,560
youtube and facebook on average 50

384
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,440
of the sites in the top alexa top 1

385
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,800
million

386
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,519
are

387
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,240
are v6 enabled us is

388
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,320
quite a bit better

389
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,200
three sites and i i saw bing there i was

390
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,920
like wow good job microsoft where to go

391
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,360
um

392
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,600
average 64 to 68 and and they all

393
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,920
support v6 i don't know if anybody is uh

394
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,120
familiar with

395
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,920
the apac space here i am not as versed

396
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,519
but there's a site called

397
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,639
taobao t-a-o-b-a-o i've never heard of

398
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,600
it but it seems to have zero v6

399
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,000
we'll get back to that later um

400
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,160
anyway so interesting right interesting

401
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,639
interesting about the top now if you're

402
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,160
if you consider the internet so i am

403
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,839
going to kind of point back to bert from

404
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,959
yesterday

405
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,079
and his amazing keynote he's a tough act

406
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,279
to follow

407
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,680
um but if you take this and you say okay

408
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,279
well the internet is like three

409
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,399
companies

410
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,959
we're good we're done go home

411
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,720
go have a latte over there in the break

412
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,800
room and you know i'll give you 31

413
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,399
minutes of your life back

414
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,399
but i don't think that's the case

415
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,360
so

416
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,399
when you start to dig in deeper

417
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,240
if you look back

418
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,399
many moons ago when you know we all got

419
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,920
this party started

420
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,839
you said okay well there's a lot of

421
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,920
things that we were trying to we're

422
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,760
trying to kind of wrestle through here

423
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,639
yo

424
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,320
does the gear scale do we know how to

425
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,880
operationalize you know v6

426
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,360
so if you look at world v6 day and

427
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,720
launch

428
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,760
those

429
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,160
events and events preceding it were

430
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,399
intended to really kind of get us ready

431
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,399
for you know what i'm going to call you

432
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
know your basic v6

433
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,199
you can scale it in a very specific

434
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,079
direction so youtube facebook google

435
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,160
search etc can go turn it on and a

436
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,000
router is not going to blow up anymore

437
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,959
you know you won't have any

438
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,920
machines crashing or what have you right

439
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,480
but now as we shift this view and take a

440
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,240
different look at

441
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
what does this all mean i don't think

442
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,240
anybody here would say it's impossible

443
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,160
to deploy v6 it's actually not all that

444
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,079
hard right turning it on

445
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,680
turn on by default it's really not that

446
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,519
hard v6 only is different conversation

447
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,240
that's

448
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,440
that's still

449
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,480
hard

450
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,600
um

451
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,040
but when you look at

452
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,040
comprehensive experiences and i remember

453
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,440
a friend of mine from a t shin miyagawa

454
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,160
you know we we i remember years ago

455
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,079
we did a demo where he did a demo of

456
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,160
what google maps would look like behind

457
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,920
some kind of character net and like all

458
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,760
the tiles were like slowly painting and

459
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,360
some were missing

460
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,079
imagine that as your experience on the

461
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,079
internet when

462
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,360
you're trying to make it a v6 only

463
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,839
experience but it's like

464
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,720
half missing right so if you look at

465
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,399
these stats which i will not read

466
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,480
because it's a bit of an eye chart

467
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,240
you'll have

468
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,720
lots of sites that have embedded urls

469
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,040
some you see some you don't

470
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,199
you know there's a lot yeah embedded you

471
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,160
know whether you see or not even

472
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,000
google's homepage you know if you unpack

473
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,240
that there's a ton of stuff that is

474
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,519
happening behind the scenes as you all

475
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,120
know right i'm not going to tell this

476
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,959
crowd in particular

477
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,800
but what's happening is as those

478
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,320
resources are or not v6 enabled you now

479
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,720
move away from the relevance of can i

480
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,000
deliver that at scale and speed and now

481
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,160
is it a complete experience

482
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,560
and what the data here is telling us it

483
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,600
is not

484
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,399
right so what ends up happening is

485
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,199
it creates some complexity around how

486
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,839
we view the next you know 10 years of v6

487
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,199
um

488
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,639
you'll see the

489
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,600
you know

490
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,800
different characteristics for global

491
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,040
sites versus u.s sites i picked the us

492
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
sites frankly because i was a little bit

493
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,320
lazy i was going to do north america

494
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,000
because i am at nanog but there's no

495
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,519
good data sources that conveniently

496
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,079
grouped information by north america so

497
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,240
i took the lazy way out at least for

498
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,959
this

499
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,399
long story short

500
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,880
you have a situation where you have

501
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,680
sites that are in the top 10 global

502
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,120
top 10 us

503
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,600
that have incomplete experiences

504
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,199
so we took it a step further and we said

505
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,920
hey so well i took it a step further we

506
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,079
said hey

507
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,480
who is actually serving

508
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,839
what are the networks that are serving

509
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,600
that content

510
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,680
in some cases it's the company who owns

511
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,800
it and others

512
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,679
it's not so if you look in the global

513
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,599
view you have

514
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,640
10 cent china telecom and microsoft

515
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,679
serving a huge portion of those top that

516
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,000
you know that top 10 content globally

517
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,520
that's interesting

518
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,359
you know go microsoft

519
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,199
um

520
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,119
one of them doesn't support v6 at all

521
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,720
right

522
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,679
and

523
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,919
when i when i point this out it's not

524
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,240
microsoft sites it's the sites that are

525
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,799
probably on azure that are somebody

526
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,080
else's top 10 sites globally

527
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,960
okay

528
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,760
microsoft sports v6

529
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,799
us

530
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,360
amazon akamai and fastly

531
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,200
like staggering numbers here right but

532
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,720
but

533
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,799
yeah that that listing there for amazon

534
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,880
for example is not amazon.com it's stuff

535
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,720
that's on aws right

536
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
they all support v6 i mean and look at

537
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
the look at the numbers 70 percent

538
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,559
globally are all you know being served

539
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,039
by those networks 79 us that's a lot

540
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,080
um

541
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,679
again this is not a measure of traffic

542
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,280
it's a measure of what you know what

543
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,600
i'll call experience i'll skip over this

544
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,360
slide but basically the cliff notes

545
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,559
version of this for your viewing

546
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,200
pleasure later in case you cannot sleep

547
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,240
is

548
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,679
get the site

549
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,000
fetch all the unique names that are

550
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,720
embedded with urls within the site

551
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,200
look up do they support v6 or not and

552
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
which networks are they on

553
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,280
pretty simple right i'll probably end up

554
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,440
posting some of this to github at some

555
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,679
point and you guys can help me find bugs

556
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,880
i was uh

557
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,280
i was uh i found a few my own this past

558
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,559
weekend

559
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,280
but

560
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,360
anyway it's um

561
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,200
it's interesting data right

562
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,720
so

563
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,320
what is this what does this all mean as

564
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,919
far as the next 10 is concerned right so

565
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,720
what what i found and i almost wore my

566
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,520
my facebook v6 shirt giving paul a shout

567
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,720
out the others from facebook that i

568
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,600
worked with over the years i don't think

569
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,280
there's anybody here from facebook but

570
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,799
they've done a pretty remarkable job at

571
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,280
a really kind of a consistent v6

572
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,799
experience

573
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,600
i think and i would say so is t-mobile

574
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,000
and other fixed-line carriers why

575
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,919
well they're relying on it for other

576
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,440
things

577
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,000
they're running the business with v6

578
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,799
right

579
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,520
facebook is t-mobile is you know

580
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,840
other service providers are so this

581
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,240
conversation has shifted from

582
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,320
can we can we deliver lots of bids fast

583
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,000
to can we deliver all the bits

584
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,160
comprehensively right

585
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,960
um

586
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,280
and what what i've seen you know just in

587
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,520
my travels you know past

588
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,559
20 plus years is if you're not using it

589
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,600
not if it's not top of mind if you're

590
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,520
not eating around dog food and i ca and

591
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,600
i'm drawing a blank on you know on the

592
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,960
saying right out of sight out of mind

593
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,559
that's the thing i'm looking for

594
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,880
it's true with v6 if you're not

595
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,400
if you're not actively

596
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,760
using it on a daily basis you'll have

597
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,880
you know

598
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,960
a route that's down you'll have an

599
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,240
interface that's shut you'll have

600
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,440
something that's just not you know

601
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,280
working the way it's supposed to but

602
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,720
when you're relying on it and it goes

603
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,640
away and suddenly there's an outage that

604
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,679
results

605
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,720
it's a big deal right so

606
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,400
operationalization of e6 is a big deal

607
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,280
so

608
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,400
sharing the

609
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,440
preceding

610
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,120
20 minutes of

611
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,080
you know

612
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,440
information with you

613
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,520
points to

614
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,679
the time is you know we're we're at a

615
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,760
kind of an apex here where you're moving

616
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,799
towards

617
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,080
trying to

618
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,159
complete the experience not just proving

619
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,840
that you can do it right

620
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,520
i think you know

621
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,760
i see many faces in the audience here we

622
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,600
know we can do it right

623
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,559
um

624
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,039
but now it's about doing it completely

625
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,159
right

626
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,320
um

627
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,960
so interesting

628
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,840
so as we

629
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
as we look ahead right and you'll see

630
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,400
some stuff on the agenda for

631
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,960
you know for today here

632
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,559
um

633
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,440
you know experience tells us that

634
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,799
you know most v6 today has been a

635
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,039
brownfield deployment you've been

636
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,720
it's been turned on for something that

637
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,679
was already v4

638
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,600
10 years ago

639
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,080
that's probably a lot harder than it is

640
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,600
today it was certainly a lot harder than

641
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,880
it is today

642
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,000
i can tell you v6 only

643
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,960
is still

644
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,559
pretty hard

645
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,080
what's going to get interesting

646
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,559
is how people are going to start to use

647
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,400
their v6 infrastructures to deliver

648
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,760
before

649
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,200
i don't you know i don't mean to be

650
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,799
controversial but i mean i think v4 is

651
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,120
going to be

652
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,000
around for a while right it's really how

653
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,360
it's going to be around that that

654
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,679
matters

655
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,320
but if i you know as as i look and

656
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,039
reflect back on the data that you know

657
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,480
i've seen in preparation for this

658
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,760
conversation

659
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,559
it's evident that in many cases

660
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,960
v6 was turned on

661
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,200
hey let's deliver some you know some

662
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
content for some eyeballs

663
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,679
but you know and and many

664
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,440
you know eyeball networks are dual stack

665
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,960
so you have a convenient you know

666
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,840
fallback 2 to v4

667
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,760
it's it was a nice safety net in 2011

668
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,559
2012 for sure right um

669
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,559
but you got to ask yourself

670
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,840
what is that

671
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,039
you know is that is that is that a

672
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,200
crutch is that a handicap that's having

673
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,039
some sort of adverse effect that that

674
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:24,960
we're now starting to see here

675
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,720
and

676
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,559
interestingly enough if you go back to

677
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,559
the slide where i talk about the you

678
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,760
know all the networks that are serving

679
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,880
this content

680
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,600
you now have this centralization to some

681
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,480
extent that's happening you have a

682
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,640
handful of networks that are serving a

683
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,360
substantial amount of the traffic

684
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,880
so there's an opportunity there's an

685
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,640
opportunity there for those networks

686
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,760
and you know

687
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,640
sadly martin's retired right but you

688
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,240
could you know do the cloudflare move

689
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,240
and you know turn it on by default for

690
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,120
you know for everybody

691
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,960
and

692
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,200
you know i think as part of the next 10

693
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,280
years that's

694
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,720
feels like something that's in the cards

695
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,000
right

696
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,360
you have

697
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,799
addresses that are kind of

698
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,960
gathering around certain networks for v4

699
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,159
those same networks if you go back

700
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,480
red is backwards right for the this

701
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,720
clicker thing we're going to find out

702
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
yep

703
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,159
you have a handful of networks that

704
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,559
you know are serving in a substantial

705
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,880
amount of the traffic right

706
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,240
there's an opportunity here to kind of

707
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,080
move this to move this ball right

708
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,440
once

709
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,640
you now have v6 operationalized and now

710
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,640
you're relying on it

711
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,480
i've heard i've heard more conversations

712
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,159
this week than i was expecting about

713
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,559
transition technologies again i haven't

714
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,159
touched anything v6 in

715
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,440
five years

716
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,039
i'm hearing mappy map t ds light i know

717
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,039
cam you know t-mobile did you know 464

718
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,360
x-lab you know many moons ago

719
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,720
but the interesting thing about all

720
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
these

721
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,880
they all require v6

722
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
and if it doesn't work you're gonna know

723
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,919
like

724
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,200
real fast

725
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,720
really painfully

726
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,640
and you know when i when i when i kind

727
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,880
of again reflect back to

728
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,520
world v6 day and launch

729
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,200
you know it was dual stack was just the

730
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,039
beginning and i you know and maybe

731
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,559
somebody from the audience can remember

732
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,039
better than me i don't remember anybody

733
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,919
turning v6 only on for v6 world v6 day

734
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,720
or launch that was just crazy talk right

735
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,480
but yeah when you look back you know

736
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,400
then but what it but it definitely

737
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
served this purpose it you know we

738
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,840
learned

739
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,279
we proved ourselves that we can run

740
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,159
networks that were v6 enabled you know

741
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,919
while you know making sure that we were

742
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,840
you know continue to you know run the

743
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,480
business on v4

744
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
but interestingly enough

745
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,000
you know here in

746
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,279
the three short days that yeah we've

747
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,279
been in minneapolis i've heard a lot of

748
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,400
people talking about transition

749
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,000
technologies many of which are going to

750
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,360
ride over

751
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
ipv4

752
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,919
sorry ip6

753
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,039
and i think what you're going to end up

754
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,480
seeing

755
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,720
is something similar to what you know

756
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
you know facebook did right

757
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,159
facebook has a rock-solid

758
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,480
you know you know v6 only implementation

759
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
and what i think you'll start to see as

760
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,120
this trend continues again into the next

761
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,039
10 years you'll see a lot more of it

762
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,480
you're going to see v6 being used

763
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,320
yeah of course to deliver content to its

764
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,799
destination but also as a way to

765
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,120
continue to support you know before

766
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,200
as long in this transition

767
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,200
you have a couple talks coming up from

768
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,360
from fernando

769
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
so maybe i'll stir the pot here you know

770
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,320
a little bit

771
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,360
it's an area of specialization that i

772
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,320
sometimes try to

773
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,720
entertain people with

774
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,520
but

775
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,400
you know once you can operationalize

776
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,440
things

777
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,400
you're a v6 only infrastructure there's

778
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,720
a lot of things that you know

779
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,200
you can do interestingly with it

780
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,679
looking back five six seven years ago

781
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,039
there's a lot of conversations that were

782
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,360
had then that seemed just

783
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,400
obvious

784
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,799
we're still talking about them now

785
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,240
and i'll talk a little bit about that

786
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
here then hopefully leave some time for

787
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,720
some you know some questions and answers

788
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,840
um

789
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,080
but the

790
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,120
the intersection of the cost of e4 the

791
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,039
availability of e4

792
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,480
and now with you know the ability to

793
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,960
operate v6 under our belt

794
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,720
seems like an interesting time

795
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,039
right now as we look into the next 10

796
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,240
years

797
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,000
um

798
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,039
built on v6 v6 only

799
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,919
um

800
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,000
you know it's interesting because

801
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,080
there was a day

802
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,200
you know

803
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,600
where we talked about v6 only like to

804
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,720
the internet

805
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,520
um i i was probably one of those people

806
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,600
um i don't know if i i don't know to

807
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,760
what extent it really

808
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,360
when i thought we would get there i do

809
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,760
believe you know we will we will get

810
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,799
there

811
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,000
but but

812
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,400
when i looked at those numbers globally

813
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,919
for alexa

814
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,120
getting a v6 only experience globally

815
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,279
that's going to take a while i think

816
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,640
but i think it can be done and i think

817
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,080
what you're going to find along the way

818
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,919
is people are going to start

819
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,240
understanding better how to use v6 as a

820
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,159
tool to run their business

821
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,559
at the end of the day that's

822
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,000
that's what it was all about right being

823
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,720
able to continue to you know run grow

824
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,720
and operate your business

825
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,480
one of the things that i think will have

826
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,799
to acknowledge and again you know again

827
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,120
stirring the pot just a hair for for

828
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,399
fernando

829
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,640
you're going to start seeing things like

830
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,399
v6

831
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,640
innovations like segment routing

832
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,279
things that require a v6 infrastructure

833
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,760
segment routing yeah and i can send some

834
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,880
send some of this to the mailing list

835
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,520
but there was some work done in the itf

836
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,679
some folks from different parts of kind

837
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,279
of the internet ecosystem

838
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,640
about using v6 only and segment routing

839
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,080
for multicast

840
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,880
um you know things and i know there's

841
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,200
not another other friend in the audience

842
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,440
who's delivering piles of

843
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,399
you know these you know ip multicast

844
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,200
it's non-trivial it's actually you know

845
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,399
not a simple infrastructure to run

846
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,720
and when you have the ability

847
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,480
based off of a

848
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,640
you know pervasive deployment of v6

849
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,120
things like sr to delete to simplify how

850
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,880
you deliver v6 multicast

851
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,399
become

852
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,080
interesting

853
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
not only that but

854
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,399
v6 and the vastness of it even basic

855
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,679
things right like you don't have

856
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,720
you know if anybody runs a dtp server

857
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,480
anywhere and you ever worried about

858
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,840
you know pool exhaustion

859
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,200
you don't have that problem anymore

860
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,840
you take a prefix pin it to a pin into a

861
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,320
prefix and or an interface on a router

862
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,200
and when the router dies throw it away

863
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,120
and it's v6 prefix if you so choose to

864
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,480
with v4 you just don't have that luxury

865
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,000
so

866
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,039
again you know using this as a

867
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,440
to induce some conversation

868
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,880
given where we're seeing a lot of the

869
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,399
traffic today

870
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,880
you now have cloud infrastructure you

871
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,200
have whether you know you build your own

872
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,880
kubernetes clusters or use it through

873
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,679
aws azure google oracle whatever

874
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840
i started looking at kubernetes about

875
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,679
five years ago

876
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,080
and and hopefully i don't offend anybody

877
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,600
with this but i would wouldn't mind a

878
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,440
little bit of a discussion about it to

879
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,679
mike i looked at kubernetes networking

880
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,279
and i said wow

881
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,480
it's like v4 only whose idea was that

882
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,120
i was like it was perfectly suited for

883
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,559
for for v6 and v6 only and that that's

884
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,559
not just the v6 zealot in me talking

885
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,720
it's like it just just makes so much

886
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,240
sense right you know you have the

887
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,960
ingress controllers yeah the the egress

888
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,320
you know where you do all this

889
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,480
translation anyway

890
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,320
so one of the things that i hope you

891
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,440
know hopefully that we see in the next

892
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,520
10 years right

893
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,559
is

894
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,840
innovations like that where you can take

895
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,600
technologies that are

896
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,960
in many cases

897
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:28,159
just burning through address space

898
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,000
a lot of inefficiencies around

899
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,399
translating from net 10 and whatever

900
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,039
else to you know some kind of publicly

901
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,799
pinned up you know address on the on the

902
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,159
ingress controller

903
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:38,960
but if you look at something like

904
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,120
kubernetes and you say to yourself wow

905
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,039
you know great opportunity for things

906
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,600
like it to be v6 only

907
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,880
you can now start to talk about things

908
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,880
like entire data centers you know being

909
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,080
v6 only and having you know the edges be

910
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,240
little stack

911
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,600
i would never i would never recommend

912
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,360
that just for fun

913
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,760
um but but from a business point of view

914
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,519
it might be something that you know we

915
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,799
need to

916
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,080
we really need to you know consider

917
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,960
so

918
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,840
going into the back nine here

919
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,200
i got 10 minutes

920
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,600
i think

921
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,640
so this is a little bit more than 10

922
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,640
years from now i really hope i'm not the

923
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,679
guy giving this talk 10 years from now

924
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,240
so next june is 10 years

925
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,039
from world v6 launch

926
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,200
it's really quite the bummer that

927
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,440
we could be here for this you know a few

928
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,039
months ago for

929
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,320
you know

930
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,080
the 10th anniversary of willfully six

931
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,519
day we'll figure something out um

932
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,919
but when you look at when you look at

933
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:42,720
you know

934
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,640
the next 10 years

935
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,799
you know i think you know at least my

936
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,240
view is

937
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,919
after looking all this data over the

938
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,360
past few months getting ready to come

939
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,720
here and see you all

940
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,880
you know i think i think

941
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,200
you know the the crystal ball says

942
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,600
you know you'll see a lot more v6

943
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,760
operationalized you know for for real

944
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,720
for for real use for real

945
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,480
you know service delivery

946
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,519
i can tell you that from my experience

947
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,559
it was it was that way from the

948
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,880
beginning right we didn't we didn't have

949
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,640
you know too many options other than

950
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,480
making that happen

951
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,240
i think that will produce the opera

952
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,960
operationalization v6 will produce

953
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,039
more comprehensive v6 experiences which

954
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,440
ultimately will take us to a point where

955
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,559
you can have a v6 on experience

956
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,919
and you'll see some innovation yeah and

957
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,679
i hope i hope the ones i put put up

958
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,640
there

959
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,320
i hope they're boring and i hope

960
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,559
cooler things you more useful things

961
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,320
popped out from it over the next you

962
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,159
know 10 years and i hope there's

963
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,600
somebody else up here talking about them

964
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,240
other than me

965
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,320
and i think v4 is still going to be

966
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,840
around in some way shape or form um

967
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,200
yeah i think you'll see v4 as a service

968
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,720
carried over v6 um

969
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,200
and uh yeah i think

970
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,960
yeah based on you know the data that

971
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,039
we're seeing that looks like it could be

972
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,320
a possibility but again i think you're

973
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
going to see way more robust music

974
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,519
experiences so

975
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,640
with that

976
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,039
thank you

977
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,600
happy take questions or

978
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,240
john whatever

979
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,279
is next on our list of things to do here

980
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,720
we have one question that might go ahead

981
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,640
hey um

982
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,159
not sure if this is going to be a

983
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,880
question or a rant disguises a question

984
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,240
oh sorry chris woodfield with twitter um

985
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,279
i think

986
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,679
i think here in this room network

987
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,679
operators for the most part we're

988
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,399
preaching to the converted um

989
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,039
nobody here questions

990
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:49,919
the

991
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,760
the need to support ipv6 the desire to

992
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,039
um

993
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,640
we really gotta take to the fight take

994
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,200
the fight at this point to

995
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,080
to applications and developers

996
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,200
um

997
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,279
you know you mentioned kubernetes which

998
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:09,599
is i would have brought up if you hadn't

999
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:10,960
a lot of

1000
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,800
a lot of

1001
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,839
other

1002
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,560
widely adopted applications even open

1003
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,918
source

1004
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,280
hadoop for example um

1005
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,199
i've heard mentioned that

1006
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,399
that thing that facebook

1007
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,679
um

1008
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,520
i've heard mentioned that

1009
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,399
they have a fork to support hadoop

1010
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,760
v600

1011
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,839
under i'm sorry support

1012
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,359
these six in their fork of hadoop

1013
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,280
and have been working for years to try

1014
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,359
to get that fork

1015
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,918
bran you know merge back into the master

1016
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,800
branch for that for that application so

1017
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,320
far it hasn't happened yet

1018
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,520
um

1019
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,560
and

1020
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,239
that's one example off the top of my

1021
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,839
head and i'm sure there are dozens and

1022
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,240
dozens of others

1023
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,440
or even the apps can listen on

1024
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,240
uh internal applications that

1025
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,040
care about the client ip address

1026
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,480
so

1027
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,079
so someone turns on their app if they're

1028
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,040
doing any sort of geolocation or

1029
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,400
or abuse tracking or anything where they

1030
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,880
care they have to parse

1031
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,720
you know either the client address

1032
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,960
coming in or the exported forehead or

1033
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,400
from the edge proxy forwarding the

1034
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,599
connection

1035
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,119
um

1036
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,440
you know that needs to be that needs to

1037
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,760
be dual stack aware as well and that's

1038
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,960
that's a challenge also um

1039
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,599
so so what's the answer chris i mean um

1040
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,680
i'm i'm just pointing out these are the

1041
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,079
current issues i'm and i'm wondering is

1042
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,680
how

1043
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,160
any strategies any

1044
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,119
any advice for how to take this

1045
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,119
how to take this how to communicate the

1046
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,359
importance of it other than

1047
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,200
you know you must do this because one

1048
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,079
you know one day a few years from now

1049
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,520
you know we're gonna be sending you v6

1050
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,520
traffic and you have to be ready

1051
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,280
maybe we should we should do a

1052
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,720
you know next nano we should have the

1053
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
hadoop and the whoever else people show

1054
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,240
up here and tell us

1055
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,400
explain to us i'm sure somebody in this

1056
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,160
community knows who they are if not we

1057
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,839
could find them but i mean

1058
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,359
i like i said to the very beginning of

1059
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,040
this i'm not here to like you know

1060
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,040
cheerlead or pep talk or whatever but

1061
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,400
like it's i don't disagree with you

1062
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
right i just you know at some point in

1063
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,000
time it's like you know people have to

1064
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,079
kind of get with the program right and

1065
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,599
uh and not only that but just having it

1066
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,800
implemented doesn't mean like

1067
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,320
instantaneously it's rolled out to every

1068
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,680
hadoop cluster on the planet i mean it

1069
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,920
takes time man right so i think

1070
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,599
preaching to the to the choir but i mean

1071
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,760
let's pour the converted but not

1072
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,160
everybody's converted right and some of

1073
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,520
the people are here right

1074
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,800
thanks

1075
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,480
let me alternate between online

1076
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,400
questions and finally so we have at

1077
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,599
least a couple online questions the

1078
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,680
first one from matt pitak who's

1079
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,640
currently unaffiliated yes

1080
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,880
when you did your experiment when you uh

1081
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,320
the sample code you talked about with

1082
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,440
github

1083
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,880
did you fetch for those um elements via

1084
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,040
v6 and did you check essentially did you

1085
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,440
check to see if the the quad a records

1086
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,560
could be fetched via v6 or was there

1087
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,599
some ipv4 dependency in the mix that you

1088
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,280
may not have checked for

1089
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,680
great question um so

1090
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,240
also hi matt so happy to follow up on

1091
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,440
email

1092
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,480
as well but basically it was a fetch of

1093
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,760
the page

1094
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,480
a

1095
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,400
extraction of all the urls and hostnames

1096
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,800
that went with it

1097
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,160
and there was a connectivity check

1098
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,200
so we

1099
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,720
i i was able to identify the

1100
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,520
dependencies yeah based off of dns and

1101
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,800
um

1102
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,359
and ultimately leveraged you know

1103
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:44,800
something from aaron like this i was

1104
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,000
talking to peter about the shares today

1105
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,640
who is to basically look up all the the

1106
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,800
net names for the serving networks etc

1107
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,920
so so yes matt we we did take i i did

1108
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,160
take into account the

1109
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,760
you know reachability and accessibility

1110
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,200
for that i also

1111
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,520
used different name servers so 1.1.1

1112
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,680
8.8.8 default name servers etc and

1113
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,440
user agents three different user agents

1114
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,880
chrome firefox and safari which

1115
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,320
surprisingly all produced very different

1116
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,720
results

1117
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,359
next in keyword mic in the room

1118
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,200
not going to say my name

1119
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,520
go ahead chris

1120
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,960
uh

1121
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,200
so what you know now what would you have

1122
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,000
done 20 30 years ago

1123
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,520
i wasn't well 30 years ago i wasn't

1124
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,920
working on it uh 20 years ago i was

1125
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,200
nothing i wasn't done anything

1126
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
differently right i mean we i mean the

1127
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,560
work the work that was done solved

1128
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,560
business problems chris right that's why

1129
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,839
i haven't touched anything b6 in five

1130
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:44,880
years

1131
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,599
so

1132
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,960
i think

1133
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,359
different time different problems now

1134
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,240
so you know the question now is

1135
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,680
what what gets done now

1136
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,640
next question online from dan mcgourian

1137
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,920
who's with the

1138
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,760
john hopkins university applied physics

1139
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,800
lab

1140
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,560
this question is kind of about

1141
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,800
deployment and the

1142
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,119
perhaps the stifling with um

1143
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,920
the growth of nat and also with the

1144
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,240
problems of firewalls and other security

1145
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,920
related things that sort of kill and end

1146
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,000
connectivity you know in the there's

1147
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,800
this um it seems have slowed the growth

1148
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,119
significantly for v6 on the enterprise

1149
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,720
perhaps and at least on the end user

1150
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,560
side this where there still may be

1151
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,400
islands with with straight outs and

1152
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,760
stuff does this

1153
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,280
um

1154
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,440
you know are we at

1155
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,200
essentially a

1156
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,640
a point where we can't reach uh certain

1157
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,359
points to to actually have v6 deploy

1158
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,320
because of

1159
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,680
those types of issues that are occurring

1160
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,040
or those type of technologies that are

1161
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,000
in the way

1162
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,560
two brief responses to that you know the

1163
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,760
the enterprise is actually a very

1164
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,160
interesting topic for for v6 but i do

1165
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,440
also think that

1166
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,000
kind of the folks who run you know the

1167
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,599
cloud infrastructure that by the way

1168
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,520
many of these enterprises use have a

1169
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,200
very interesting distinct opportunity to

1170
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
kind of help move the ball there

1171
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,920
i

1172
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,200
i'll tell you from my personal

1173
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,400
experience 15 years ago yep lots of

1174
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,240
firewalls lots of load bouncers lots of

1175
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,640
whatever's that didn't dv6

1176
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,119
as a five years ago

1177
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,240
not so much right so you know you know i

1178
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,800
hate to use the answer that was used

1179
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,319
years ago but like as part of refresh

1180
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,480
cycles you know you'd have to go almost

1181
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,319
out of your way in my opinion to put

1182
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:31,920
something in the network that doesn't

1183
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,079
that doesn't support it

1184
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:36,160
so i'm happy to follow that offline as

1185
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,599
well but but i think the enterprise

1186
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,680
question is absolutely a really

1187
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,400
good one john for ostompak

1188
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,240
and in the room next to thecube

1189
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,240
leigh howard ipv4.global by healthcare

1190
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,480
stream bank um which if anybody doesn't

1191
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,000
know me i'm not going to say anything

1192
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,880
bad about ipv6 of course um

1193
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,640
i uh so

1194
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,000
agreeing with you actually kind of

1195
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,040
following on to that question maybe a

1196
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,000
little bit

1197
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,920
that i think the the the economic

1198
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,119
drivers that you pointed out for all

1199
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,800
these other segments will probably

1200
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,560
gradually increasingly apply to

1201
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,720
enterprises maybe not so much now but i

1202
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,720
think that we'll get there my question

1203
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,400
for you that would be more

1204
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,079
back to the other part of that is the

1205
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,560
consumer side is we can i can see the

1206
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,000
economic drivers for the data center for

1207
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,599
eyeball networks

1208
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:20,880
what are the economic drivers for

1209
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,839
consumer electronics

1210
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,200
i can't see do you see a way to get

1211
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,000
there

1212
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,160
uh yeah i mean you know i'll tell you

1213
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,760
this much if this thing still works

1214
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,359
that's why i think you know if you look

1215
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:32,880
at the last

1216
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,400
whoever has control here can you go back

1217
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,200
to

1218
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,079
it's v4 as a service yeah that's it

1219
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,079
yeah and and i think i think the the

1220
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,839
space that you're in where you're you

1221
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,720
know kind of the marketplace for v4

1222
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,160
look is 50x an address i don't blame you

1223
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,400
wow it's like where do i get some man

1224
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,240
it's let me

1225
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,000
sell your v4 so you can deploy v6 like

1226
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,599
why are you not doing this

1227
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,680
so so yeah i

1228
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,200
crappy answer i don't know but it's

1229
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,119
truthful

1230
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,960
next question online uh it's a little

1231
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,560
bit of a theme i think that's it's

1232
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,119
forming so you may be repeating yourself

1233
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,319
perhaps somewhat um but gus uh

1234
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,000
schlitman asks private sector

1235
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,680
affiliation says you know what message

1236
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,440
would you take to

1237
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,359
or i assume that's maybe for him what

1238
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:18,880
message do you take to your company's

1239
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,880
leadership to initiate the journey

1240
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,720
towards uh v6 conversion

1241
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,279
that's easy

1242
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,160
not the slides can be shown up

1243
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,760
oh yeah oh i guess they're not up there

1244
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,920
bomber there we go yeah i'd give them

1245
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,200
that one

1246
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,640
that's light and show them that yeah

1247
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,599
hopefully

1248
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,359
uh gus can see that

1249
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,119
i mean that what it was what you know

1250
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,800
lee just said about the cost of you know

1251
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,640
v4 i mean that's

1252
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,078
you know or the opportunity to

1253
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,240
i don't say profit but i guess kind of

1254
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,400
you know and kind of use that to you

1255
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,839
know you know

1256
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,280
take things to where they have to go

1257
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,400
directionally for your for your

1258
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,640
enterprise or your company

1259
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,520
kevin

1260
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,920
kevin bloomberg the wire yeah the

1261
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,760
numbers up there are the cost of the

1262
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,599
sausage casings

1263
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,440
as far as the consumers concerned they

1264
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,400
have no concept of that

1265
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,319
it's important for us but not for them

1266
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,040
we have always i think been very careful

1267
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,040
not to break stuff when we've gone to

1268
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,760
the dual ipv4 ipv6 all of that

1269
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,000
because there's been no economic driver

1270
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,240
as you said for many

1271
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,440
cases

1272
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,599
so you do it slowly and methodically and

1273
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,920
you go up and your numbers were showing

1274
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,480
20 years for many cases

1275
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,560
and yet with tls

1276
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,599
we've just broken intentionally

1277
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,839
in the name of security

1278
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,240
right in the name of compliance

1279
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,599
insurance

1280
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,760
we've just moved ahead and said sorry

1281
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,440
your computer is now done good luck

1282
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,480
um

1283
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,079
so i think we're going to get to that

1284
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,319
point sooner rather than later

1285
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,640
where we just can't keep holding on to

1286
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,960
that windows xp

1287
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,200
computer or that windows 98 computer

1288
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,599
and holding the everybody back because

1289
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,319
we want to be okay for that person

1290
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,160
but what really scared me john on these

1291
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,599
numbers and i hadn't looked in a long

1292
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:18,480
time

1293
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,400
the easiest people

1294
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,040
to encourage v6 is the content and the

1295
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,960
number was 30 percent

1296
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,119
that's pathetic and that's not this

1297
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,720
audience by and large

1298
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,240
it is though

1299
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,760
you put the slide back up on the screen

1300
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,720
it is

1301
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,359
networks available we make the the

1302
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,000
infrastructure available in this room

1303
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,760
we're not the ones who are turning on

1304
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,480
and off yes cloudflare and those types

1305
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,720
of companies have absolutely helped in

1306
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,640
getting it but really all they're doing

1307
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,040
is in that translation the other way for

1308
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,200
those people who aren't web host i don't

1309
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,520
know how many people in this room are

1310
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,920
web hosting sites

1311
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,880
um that are on that alexa 1 million that

1312
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,359
you were that you're quoting so let me

1313
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,720
just color something in real quick this

1314
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,640
is important to clarify so

1315
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,560
the companies listed here

1316
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,200
are the networks serving the content for

1317
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,200
the top ten

1318
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,720
one

1319
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,240
the top 10 in the u.s on the right-hand

1320
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,079
side right if they turn it all on by

1321
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:23,920
default you you jump to 80

1322
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,720
done

1323
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,000
it's a lot that's a big jump right but

1324
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,920
the fact that i go to one of those top

1325
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,560
10 sites 100 times a day

1326
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,319
there's still a million other sites

1327
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,160
that's the the really low number that

1328
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,079
you were shown on a different slide

1329
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,920
those million sites if they all were

1330
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,319
ipv6

1331
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,800
it would be a huge push up to to to

1332
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,280
drive this and they're the easy ones

1333
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,680
changing billions of homes

1334
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,160
is hard yeah changing a million sites is

1335
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,920
not yeah

1336
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,119
i don't think i'm going to argue on that

1337
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,560
one

1338
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,160
and i think we just have one last

1339
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,839
question online from nicholas intianello

1340
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,520
