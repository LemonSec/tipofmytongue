00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,240
our next pr uh presenter is ken

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,519
salenza i get that right excellent

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,639
he'll be presenting next generation

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,199
firewall automation ken is the vp of

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,119
professional services

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,520
at network to code and this is his first

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,080
time we are certainly very happy to have

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,359
you here today

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,240
so as previously alluded to i'm ken

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,439
salenza

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,599
vp professional services a company

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,360
called network to code

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,000
specialize in network automation

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,399
i've been involved in dozens of projects

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,680
with miracle automation over the last

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,399
half decade or so

18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,680
i was your

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,480
traditional network engineer uh by day

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,640
coder by night throughout my career

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,239
i converted to full-time network

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,520
automator in 2016 when i came to network

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,920
dakota

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,680
i've been in the industry over

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,680
20 years uh primarily supporting

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,879
enterprises uh through for the air force

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,479
mckinsey and network of course

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,600
okay

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,960
that was not what i supposed to do

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,640
okay i think i got now apologies

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,400
okay so quick agenda we're gonna go

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,920
through uh manual firewall rules

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,439
management how it currently happens for

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,960
most organizations

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,600
and talk about what i'm uh coining is

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,119
current generation

37
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,000
uh

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,840
viral

39
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,680
automation and then i'm pointing as next

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,759
generation firewall animation and then

41
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,880
we're gonna do a demo it's gonna be a

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,640
little bit of different demo

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,399
because there is no uh cable here so i

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,000
pre-record it i'm gonna be talking to it

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,240
live so bear with me if my timing is

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,640
slightly off

47
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,240
okay

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,719
so manual firewall rule management this

49
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,719
is kind of what i see for most

50
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,479
organizations as we get integrated to

51
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,239
potentially talk to them about

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,959
automating such processes

53
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,239
we'll see a workflow

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,680
we see a workflow something like this

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,280
which is basically a user makes a

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,760
request often times an excel document or

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,879
similar some security person reviews it

58
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,560
for uh

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,599
validity whether it's a good rule or not

60
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,319
what path analysis what type of which

61
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,640
firewalls it should go on potentially

62
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,560
multiple firewalls

63
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,160
go through a cab review process to

64
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,720
schedule that that change

65
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,959
then finally of course implementation

66
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,120
and closing on ticket again

67
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,480
very simple but just want to kind of

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,480
reset ourselves here overall

69
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,560
okay

70
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,720
so when i work with our customers this

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,159
is kind of generally speaking what we do

72
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,040
is talk about this next step which is

73
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,800
current firewall animation

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,239
i am getting some signal here

75
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,280
oh

76
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,959
wow

77
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,519
okay i did not realize i was about in my

78
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,440
apologies folks

79
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,360
sorry for driving you guys crazy

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,959
okay

81
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,440
egg on my face that one oh so now i need

82
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,000
to go back

83
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,680
okay sorry about that folks all right so

84
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
current firewall machine this is what i

85
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,720
kind of typically work with the

86
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,879
customers on and we start developing a

87
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,200
workflow similar to this

88
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,680
uh i kind of highlighted here which

89
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,920
parts of the workflow will be automated

90
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,319
versus not automated

91
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,080
so standard you know user makes a

92
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,040
request into an itsm tool oftentimes a

93
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,200
service now or something similar the

94
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,959
operator still goes through reviews that

95
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,640
process then we get into some of the

96
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,439
steps that can more often be automated

97
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,480
some of that pre-validation uh steps

98
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,040
do things like the security review

99
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,080
uh

100
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,760
the security review to say what's a good

101
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,519
rule if it can be programmatically

102
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,159
detected as an example do things like

103
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,320
that path analysis often times things

104
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,120
like in automated trace route as example

105
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,959
or an ipm lookup

106
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,000
okay

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
go to that standard cab review process

108
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,320
and then go through pre-checks most

109
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,320
common pre-check i'll kind of talk about

110
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,720
the palo alto world which is to do that

111
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,720
test policy uh command to see if in fact

112
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,080
pre-change that the policy or the the

113
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,240
traffic is not allowed so that we can

114
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,320
verify in the post check that it is

115
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,479
allowed all right

116
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,160
of course deploy the configuration which

117
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,360
is obviously a big part of any

118
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,560
automation

119
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,160
and do that post check which is a flip

120
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,160
side to that those pre-checks that

121
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,840
happens and of course close out the

122
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,840
ticket

123
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,800
okay so there are a lot of benefits for

124
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,039
this and i wouldn't dissuade anyone from

125
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,039
from going this this route we're going

126
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,320
to talk about the other side of this as

127
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,560
well but so first and foremost to

128
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,600
standardize and normalize your

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,800
configurations i always say that

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
i may use dashes and joe is going to use

131
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,720
underscores it makes it harder to parse

132
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,479
the configurations later

133
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,479
you get that form validation to ensure a

134
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,160
reasonable level of quality instead of

135
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,919
those spreadsheets so if someone's using

136
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,440
itsm tool

137
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,120
there's actual form validation say it's

138
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,960
an ip address or an ipa range etc

139
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
enables customers to sell provision

140
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,240
which helps reduce time to market right

141
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,759
they can if they are technical savvy

142
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,800
customer they can create that request

143
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,240
and see the automation go through

144
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,240
without it potentially any erection

145
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,440
themselves

146
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,680
with the security team

147
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,320
provides traceability of that those

148
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,160
configuration pushes and we'll talk

149
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,440
about what some of the traceability

150
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,800
doesn't provide

151
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,199
but it does you can go back and say this

152
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,120
one rule was deployed on this day for

153
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,199
this reasons and so forth

154
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,360
and reduces that monotonous task and

155
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
associated fatigue i work with some

156
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,840
organizations where they are literally

157
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,360
dealing with hundreds of firewall

158
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
changes a day and that's just gonna

159
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,199
you're just gonna mess up at times now

160
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,840
there's no two ways about it

161
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,000
okay but we're gonna talk about next

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,840
generation so what's the problem stating

163
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,360
here where are some of the cons

164
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,600
associated with this

165
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,840
it requires expert level

166
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,840
knowledge on how applications and

167
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,160
networks work we as network engineers

168
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,680
security engineers will oftentimes

169
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,280
not really remember what it was like to

170
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,440
not know these things but i've had heard

171
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,919
from hundreds of application developers

172
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,840
not understand the idea of uh

173
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,600
bi-directional traffic and where the tcp

174
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,680
sent is being sent thinking because

175
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,319
information is going to and fro that it

176
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,560
should uh be bi-directional but

177
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,919
obviously we as network engineers know

178
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,479
that's not the case

179
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,319
it is not an intended state

180
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,680
uh it doesn't provide the intended state

181
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,759
source of truth infrastructure can't get

182
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,759
that declarative configuration as an

183
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,120
example

184
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
okay

185
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,000
rule creation is difficult to track here

186
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
right so when you're when you're after

187
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,840
view a rule you can

188
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,080
find that one rule if you want to view

189
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,919
all rules it's very difficult to go back

190
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,160
and understand who did what when

191
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,880
basically it's just a long audit process

192
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,240
similarly

193
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
rule ownership is hard to understand who

194
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,080
owns that rule right especially when you

195
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,319
have shared objects and similar things

196
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,479
uh traversing multiple security points

197
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,560
just kind of complicates things various

198
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,919
different firewalls and different edge

199
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,120
control

200
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,840
components that are there

201
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,759
one thing i've noticed is that firewalls

202
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,840
grow exponentially but they're rarely

203
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,318
removed

204
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,800
okay so now we're into the crux of it

205
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,280
next generation firewall automation

206
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,360
this is what i'm going to say is around

207
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,919
the idea of application-centric firewall

208
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,840
automation

209
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,000
so it's a source of truth that models

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,160
applications and the relationships

211
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,639
between them that's the crux of what

212
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,879
we're doing here is data modeling around

213
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,400
applications and then how they interact

214
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,960
with each other

215
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,800
so application dictionary is a term i've

216
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,199
been using for well over a decade

217
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,680
it's not a industry standard i've never

218
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,120
really heard anyone else talking about

219
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,479
such a such an idea so i just kind of uh

220
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,160
created this so

221
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,840
if you go investigate you're probably

222
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,080
likely just to find a lot of other

223
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,840
things i've done before

224
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,759
but nonetheless without a lack of an

225
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,360
interesting term this is the term go

226
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,919
ahead and go with

227
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
so this is the way we're going to do is

228
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,719
we'll allow

229
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,279
businesses to speak in business terms

230
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,679
right what are the applications

231
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,440
uh looking

232
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,680
what are the users looking to do they

233
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,640
want to say something like crm api can

234
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,040
talk to the crm db those are the terms

235
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,880
they want to instead what they have to

236
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,680
do is from this specific ip to this

237
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,800
specific ip on that specific port right

238
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,080
you want to get away with that that's

239
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,440
very technical for the average user of

240
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,519
these viral rules and security posture

241
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,680
and overall

242
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,360
there's a side benefit to assign

243
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,519
metadata to application and there's many

244
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,040
different things you can do with that to

245
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,120
understand your security posture much

246
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,640
better to understand things like

247
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,080
confidentiality

248
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,880
data who the owners are encryption etc

249
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,560
manage non-firewall control points and

250
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,160
what i mean by that is

251
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,640
we have aws security groups firewall d

252
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,320
et cetera we'll talk about that a few

253
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,959
more times right here and

254
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,200
how do we manage that and it's in the

255
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
idea here is by modeling the

256
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,440
infrastructure not just modeling

257
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,680
firewall rules right it's a change in

258
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,640
kind of concepts there

259
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,880
rule optimization to remove duplicate

260
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,399
and unnecessary rules and we're going

261
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,680
through it through a specific example

262
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,279
how we're going to do this but the idea

263
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,839
here is if we have uh security

264
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,360
enforcement happening

265
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,160
in

266
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,640
aws security groups why do i then need

267
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,360
to

268
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,760
have additional firewall rules

269
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,920
to say exactly the same thing as those

270
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,680
security groups are already providing

271
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,079
and provide full firewall rule

272
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,839
configuration often use the term

273
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,040
declarative the current generation is

274
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,800
transactional nature

275
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,040
push configurations and that data is for

276
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,959
the most part gone and lost forever

277
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,440
right you do you can go back to the itsm

278
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,680
tool or whatever tool that you put in to

279
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,279
find that information

280
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,360
but it's it's not readily available it's

281
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,680
not easy to track it's hard to do so and

282
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
you can't rebuild the current state from

283
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,839
that

284
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,519
okay

285
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,320
so

286
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,680
some of the complications of a modern

287
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,640
network

288
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,200
no longer is source and destination ip

289
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,640
and dns the end all be all for uh

290
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,480
what those source and destination

291
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,760
objects can be

292
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,440
uh instead there's things like ldap

293
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,600
groups uh contain you know container

294
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,760
services app id etc sas services

295
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,480
nat and vips this is where users may not

296
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,880
realize uh or application owners may not

297
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,160
realize that the

298
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,760
ips that their

299
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,920
their servers are on are not the ips

300
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,600
that their users are going to need and

301
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,519
to put the firewall rules to the vip not

302
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,920
to their own uh their own actual devices

303
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,120
it's kind of hard for them to track the

304
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
information

305
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,560
okay edge enforcement kind of talked

306
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,839
about that before

307
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:24,720
you know

308
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,480
in for you know there's

309
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,120
multiple layers of security and all

310
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,240
having a duplication of efforts

311
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,120
okay

312
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,560
this is kind of the design around the

313
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,440
application dictionary

314
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,160
it starts with defining applications

315
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,640
things like crmdb is this ip with this

316
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,519
port crm api is this ip with this port

317
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,079
etc

318
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,399
then defining the relationships between

319
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,160
those applications

320
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,399
right so i want my

321
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,680
uh

322
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,519
smp server to reach out to my crm

323
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,120
application to manage and kind of make

324
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,959
sure that everything is is monitored

325
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,279
correctly i want my crm application to

326
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,480
reach out to ldap service as an example

327
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,000
you still go through that security

328
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,200
review process as you uh would in any

329
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,680
kind of scenario to ensure that this is

330
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,880
required one interesting intro

331
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,959
one of the interesting interesting

332
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,639
use cases that come with this the idea

333
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,800
of having the application owner

334
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,560
into that process as well

335
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,639
to do things like say for my ldap

336
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,040
service i don't need to do it just but

337
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,880
anyone can have access to it but for my

338
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,800
hr application i want to know who is

339
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,560
accessing my data in my database

340
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,160
and i want to be part of that security

341
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,760
process and since we know where the

342
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,519
application errors we can embed them

343
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,680
into it

344
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,120
and then of course the configuration

345
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,240
management aspect of it

346
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,959
to actually deploy the configuration

347
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,440
okay so we'll take an example from from

348
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,120
the previous slide

349
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,480
and show how we do this and we're going

350
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,800
to take the access request the source

351
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,399
and destination and combine it with the

352
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,240
application definitions

353
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,959
to show how we get to this five tuple uh

354
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,320
firewall rule configuration that we're

355
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,600
all used to

356
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,680
right so we we we can

357
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,240
uh mind map how we translate from the

358
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,160
source ip and destination imports to

359
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,000
build out that firewall rule

360
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,600
in this demonstration just kind of

361
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,079
quickly review the automation stack so

362
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,240
we're using nodebot as the open source

363
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,399
truth automation platform

364
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,600
application dictionary which is a

365
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,959
plug-in primary objective what we're

366
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,880
talking about

367
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,480
we have a separate plug-in for a

368
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,240
firewall model may seem a little bit

369
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,519
counterintuitive actually help some

370
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,320
solve some interesting problems

371
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,920
and then using computer i believe that's

372
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,440
how you pronounce it never never heard

373
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,199
anyone say it before and what this does

374
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,760
is model from a you know policy and

375
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,920
service uh terminology that uh

376
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,160
competitor uses to

377
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,480
the vendor specific specifically using

378
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
palo but it can translate to juno s xr

379
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,959
asas et cetera

380
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,880
and then finally use near to deploy the

381
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,199
configurations

382
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,079
okay

383
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,199
so the workflow for this is

384
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:08,880
user makes a request that requests can

385
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,600
be

386
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,000
adding an application adding to an

387
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,240
existing application or one of those

388
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,760
relationships between those applications

389
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,959
there is an etl process etl standing for

390
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,600
extract transform and load the key part

391
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,240
of that is the transform part right and

392
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,959
what that allows us to do is to have a

393
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,079
point to put applied business logic to

394
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,000
optimize our rules

395
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,079
right

396
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,079
then it gets to the the firewall model

397
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,519
which it does just that and models

398
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,519
firewall rules

399
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,839
computer code generates configuration

400
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,360
and then finally nor near is used to

401
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,279
deploy those configuration to the edge

402
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,880
device

403
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,720
okay demo time

404
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,199
let's see how this goes here uh

405
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:53,920
what we're going to do here is we're

406
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,120
going to add an application deploy

407
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,120
configuration

408
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,639
look at the application definition here

409
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,240
and we'll see that uh we're going to

410
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,880
hone in on the hr application and talk

411
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,480
about some that metadata i was referring

412
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,360
to before and how that relates

413
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,480
so we have simple things like

414
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,240
description but more importantly things

415
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,720
like who is the application owner right

416
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,639
this is one of the things i find

417
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,839
that organizations don't do well is

418
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,320
understand who owns applications

419
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,199
which components specifically which vms

420
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,680
are being used here and the amsterdam

421
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,759
data center in this example which

422
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,480
services are applied here meaning which

423
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,279
uh

424
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,440
tcp ports are used what's the

425
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,839
justification what's the confidential at

426
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,800
confidentiality level of that

427
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,480
and then from this view we can see the

428
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,120
relationships that are inbound and

429
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,320
outbound from that application here

430
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,680
right and we're gonna specifically hone

431
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,519
in on this ldap here and we're gonna

432
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,959
show how

433
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,920
jersey city firewall cares about the

434
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,560
this application that really only exists

435
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,880
in amsterdam data center

436
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,120
right

437
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,240
okay so we look at the the jersey

438
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,560
firewall and we can

439
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,959
understand understanding how to mind map

440
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,959
these applications and specifically

441
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,720
we'll look at this first one from the hr

442
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,040
to the ldap service

443
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,800
the hr application existing in the

444
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,040
amsterdam office having a destination

445
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,160
jersey city uh data center

446
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,040
right

447
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,600
but how does it relate that traffic to

448
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,000
know to go to jersey firewall

449
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,040
because the jersey city virtual machine

450
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,439
or the ldap server in jersey city has an

451
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,720
ip address in the 10 30 50 range and we

452
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,640
defined a zone that has that network so

453
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
we're able to stitch together and

454
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,520
dynamically build out that relationship

455
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,280
on the fly to understand how

456
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,000
applications are stitched together and

457
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,559
the associated uh configurations that

458
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,439
get deployed from them

459
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,760
okay great

460
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,880
so uh one of the interesting uh

461
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,559
challenges i've talked before about that

462
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,960
atl that transform step here and we're

463
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,880
gonna jump into that here

464
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,039
uh this this transformation step as i

465
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,039
was building this out i realized that

466
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,400
the atlanta firewall

467
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,880
in this this demo here has all the

468
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,360
monitoring stuff traffic so it's a lot

469
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,520
of source or destination depending if

470
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,320
it's snp or syslog used over and over

471
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,520
and over again

472
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,200
right so constantly going from

473
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,960
moderating to all crm all these

474
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,240
different kind of components it's a

475
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,400
service used constantly similar for

476
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,720
syslog and ldap

477
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,960
and so when we look at the

478
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,120
uh atlanta firewall here

479
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,600
we're gonna see that we've defined

480
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,280
all the application dictionary view of

481
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,679
the world between the relationships

482
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,200
between all them

483
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,960
however

484
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,120
we have that transform step

485
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,760
to understand business logic and the

486
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,559
business logic i applied here was

487
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,760
to

488
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,919
create address groups

489
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,400
and group together these common services

490
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,919
such as snmp syslog and ldap right so

491
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,559
you see over and over same source ip

492
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,400
different destination p same source i p

493
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
distribution for instant p the reverse

494
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,240
true for syslog and you know

495
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,799
respectively for ldaps service as well

496
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,960
okay so we have this

497
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,799
you know eight nine times here however

498
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,160
many kind of uh

499
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,480
rules are shown here on the application

500
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,080
dictionary side of it and then we're

501
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,760
gonna scroll down here in a second which

502
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,400
is gonna show us the firewall rule model

503
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,840
which is very similar view but you're

504
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,280
gonna see how the configurations are

505
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,679
generated differently and the model is

506
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,080
different because of that business logic

507
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,919
that we use in that transformation step

508
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,160
here

509
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,880
okay great

510
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,880
so what we did was rather than just copy

511
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,640
the rules over

512
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,720
we said insert that business logic and

513
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
say we'll just create a

514
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,320
a destination address group for the snmp

515
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,039
managed services or a source address

516
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,799
group and then we aggregate all those

517
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,120
rules together we're still tracking all

518
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
that metadata who's the rule owner who

519
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,480
put this in when why etc the

520
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,039
configurations

521
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,080
are a

522
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,840
an artifact

523
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,919
of the data model

524
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,840
the firewall rules are not the data

525
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,960
model in this in this scenario

526
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,559
right and that fundamentally changes it

527
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,000
and this is just one use case but

528
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,799
there's

529
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,559
many other use cases such as i mentioned

530
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,440
before

531
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,919
just ignoring rules allowing things open

532
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,280
from an ip level because aws is is is

533
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,360
managing that security posture so why

534
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,840
create those duplicate firewalls

535
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,679
i know i'm quick here but just want to

536
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,039
show the

537
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,760
firewall policy is being deployed it is

538
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,360
pretty much it's the same configuration

539
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
the same five rules are applied on both

540
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,760
sides of this scenario so the jersey

541
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,320
city firewall data model

542
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,120
looks just like the actual configuration

543
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,640
uh on the actual

544
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,679
the palo alto firewall

545
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,960
okay

546
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,799
so now we're going to jump into

547
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,520
actually configuring an application

548
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,760
uh and specifically the dependencies so

549
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
we have the crm application

550
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,200
just being created and we're going to

551
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
build all the dependencies here and that

552
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,000
means connecting to the db connecting to

553
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,039
ldap and in the monarch services as well

554
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,000
okay

555
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,360
so we'll show how we build these

556
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,240
dependencies and how that actually gets

557
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,280
uh

558
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,520
how that actually gets to uh

559
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,480
sorry

560
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,320
how that actually gets deployed i'm

561
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,240
quickly creating the application the

562
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,559
dependencies here uh just note that it's

563
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,120
happening it's pretty pretty quick not

564
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,080
too interesting i would say

565
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,799
okay so now all the mappings are shown

566
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,360
are built uh we will go to the

567
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,280
the dependencies view

568
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,360
of this table and from there we're gonna

569
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,360
understand um

570
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,120
and we will see

571
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,080
the crm application upon refresh start

572
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,919
showing between all these application uh

573
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,880
dependencies that are shown here

574
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,799
okay great and then we'll see the crm

575
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,480
used multiple times

576
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,559
go into that and we can see the inbound

577
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,159
and outbound dependencies are

578
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,240
dynamically built throughout the entire

579
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,840
process

580
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,720
okay

581
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,320
so now when we go back to jersey

582
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,240
firewall which has the crm application

583
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,640
we will immediately see the changes in

584
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
the application dictionary but not the

585
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,120
firewall model and the reason is this

586
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,720
goes back to the etl process that

587
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,400
transformation step the synchronization

588
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,120
step that's a second step

589
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,440
purposely second step that happens

590
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,880
so we have a job here to sync the

591
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,520
databases

592
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,640
we will run that job which will sync

593
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,960
between the three different firewalls

594
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,480
firewall

595
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,559
excuse me the three different firewall

596
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,679
uh

597
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,400
firewalls firewalls topologies uh

598
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,760
they're out there

599
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
and we can see that we've now added the

600
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,960
crm application uh to to this this steps

601
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,480
series of steps

602
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,159
so the only thing left to really do here

603
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,760
is to then push the configuration that's

604
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,280
we're all here for right actually

605
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,919
pushing the the configuration to

606
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,039
uh the edge firewall and we have another

607
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,000
job there that's dedicated just for that

608
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,640
to push that configuration

609
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,799
from the data model to the palo alto

610
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,240
device

611
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,200
okay

612
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,440
and i'm going to deploy it

613
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,280
jump back show you what the firewall

614
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,000
will look like before on the

615
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,880
pallet side you'll see that it the last

616
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,600
rule there is not a crm rule

617
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,520
we'll see the compreca the capirca

618
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
configuration syntax

619
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,480
and then upon refresh we'll see that all

620
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,520
of the

621
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,480
uh

622
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,640
we'll see that the crm firewall

623
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,880
rule has now been added to there

624
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,799
and is now in sync with the intended

625
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,639
state source of truth here

626
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,280
awesome so that's the demonstration

627
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,200
there

628
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,280
so i'll jump into kind of uh

629
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
availability i do want to stop here for

630
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,679
one second just say that um i really

631
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,280
want to evangelize the idea more than

632
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,000
any kind of uh solution here um we're

633
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,080
still building this out

634
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,919
this concept i think is needed in the

635
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,919
industry more so than

636
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,840
um you know talking about that specific

637
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,799
solution

638
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,400
i think bringing building solution

639
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,159
brings it to life and that's why i

640
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,960
really enjoy this um i don't want to

641
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,720
conflate the two there

642
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,840
okay so we

643
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,279
availability know the bots open source

644
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,799
currently

645
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,720
we the known about firewall model which

646
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,039
is going to be kind of underlining is

647
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,960
being uh scheduled to be released this

648
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,159
quarter

649
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,559
and then the application dictionary

650
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,400
for next quarter

651
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,159
to be open source

652
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,799
okay that's it thanks i've been talking

653
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,400
about this a few times for other places

654
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,679
so here's some links to hear me talk

655
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,600
about this uh other places as well

656
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:34,260
[Applause]

657
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,320
do we have any questions from the

658
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,559
audience

659
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,399
we got one question online here

660
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,799
this is from gus

661
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,600
because it says

662
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,600
how does nattobot compare to the

663
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,960
solutions such as tufn's product and

664
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,240
yeah okay secure app too not much

665
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,159
administrative work is needed to keep

666
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,200
the information accurate and nudibot

667
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,840
does new to offer a new

668
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,799
offer any way to check roles being added

669
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,520
to a firewall security policy

670
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,840
okay yeah so for tufin uh tupendon

671
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,720
algosac and firemonth similar in this in

672
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,120
that space and they kind of understand

673
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,320
mathematically how viral rules um are

674
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,919
used they're gonna have better things

675
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,000
for things like path analysis and so

676
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,600
forth but it's fundamentally a different

677
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,760
solution right this is to data model

678
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,000
applications and that's to do data model

679
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,760
firewall rules right so it's

680
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,320
fundamentally different uh the next part

681
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,159
was how much work is keep to the

682
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,400
information a lot that's the biggest

683
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,240
drawback for sure

684
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,559
it is fundamentally you require

685
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,840
organizational commitment to do

686
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,200
something like this

687
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,159
okay

688
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,760
um but it gives you there's a lot of

689
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,880
side benefits for that um

690
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,360
any ability to to check

691
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,720
nothing specifically right out of the

692
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,480
box but you know the whole idea of the

693
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,760
platform is similar to many other

694
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,360
platforms you know servicenow and

695
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,279
sportscenter it's more frameworky

696
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,960
meaning it's intended to allow for

697
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,720
flexibility and expansion of other

698
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,559
services being built on top of it our

699
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,720
next question comes from al

700
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,559
can the natabot tool

701
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,880
audit the firewall rules against its own

702
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,720
data model in the case of manual rules

703
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,840
introduced yeah um

704
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,600
i don't want to say

705
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,159
it's not trivial it's it's a it's a bit

706
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,679
of ass it goes back to the flexibility

707
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,080
thing um is definitely one of the things

708
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,159
such a use case i'd want to kind of deep

709
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,360
dive and

710
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,799
and work on

711
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,960
the separation between these two models

712
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,400
between the application dictionary and

713
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,440
the firewall model um actually

714
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,840
one of the nice side benefits of that is

715
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,679
the ability to

716
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,159
uh have a transition period to go from

717
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,080
one world to another just traditional

718
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,080
firewall rule management to this

719
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,440
application-centric view of it um but

720
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,120
definitely a use case i'm interested as

721
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,200
well

722
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,880
we have one from the forum

723
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,520
uh david farmer university of minnesota

724
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,559
i got a

725
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,679
one

726
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,000
minor detail

727
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,640
you have a nice application model

728
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,840
how do you get the application owners

729
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,799
and the application creators to help you

730
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,640
fill out that model instead of having to

731
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,600
reverse engineer it

732
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,760
it has to be a top-down approach

733
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,279
it fundamentally has to be a top-down

734
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,440
approach it requires organizational

735
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,279
commitment for sure the organization

736
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,480
needs to understand

737
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,240
the value that the

738
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,559
lack of security posture the firewall

739
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,559
will sprawl the lack of understanding of

740
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,559
applications uh the lack of shared

741
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,640
ownership between that one interesting

742
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,320
things i've been in several

743
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,640
conversations with customers where i

744
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,840
asked the application owner and the

745
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,760
security team says who wants the rule

746
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
and they both do this right so in

747
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,760
essence nobody owns a rule

748
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,039
right which fundamentally means

749
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,720
it has to be positioned

750
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,520
from

751
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,159
top down to say this is important this

752
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,320
has to do with security posture etc it's

753
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,760
not an easy thing i said that that would

754
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,320
be the biggest flaw uh uh to something

755
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,720
like this

756
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,880
but there's many

757
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,240
uh side benefits side effects et cetera

758
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,840
for having this data and there's just so

759
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,000
much more metadata to gather on

760
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,399
applications uh that just the many day

761
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,918
alone is is worth a lot

762
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,320
oh we got one more we got a minute left

763
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,120
this is uh oh geez first nan hog first

764
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,799
question from brian davenport to team

765
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,919
country um i was just curious

766
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,000
you kind of mentioned it's top down so

767
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,399
where do you see the resistance come in

768
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,240
in an organization typically is it the

769
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,640
firewall owners or the network people or

770
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,919
the application like where do you

771
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,000
receive the resistance yeah i mean

772
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,200
listen the

773
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,679
this the firewall rule problem has been

774
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,399
a data nightmare since inception it is

775
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,080
basically everyone throwing the data

776
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,440
over the fence and saying deal with the

777
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,399
security team right so why do what

778
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,159
application owners want to change

779
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,240
right so that the the application owners

780
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,679
the locality the people putting the

781
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,679
requests don't want to necessarily

782
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,840
change that because to them it's you

783
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,760
know maybe it's slow but why should they

784
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,880
have ownership

785
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,919
so that's

786
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,200
pretty much uniformly where i say it

787
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,960
all right

788
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,360
23 seconds to spare awesome round of

789
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,120
applause

790
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,640
thanks

791
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,939
