5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the open source and a mess</font>

6
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,450
ok

<font color="#CCCCCC">100,000 users and we're in the network</font>

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,869
basically all by ourselves it means from

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,310
only have<font color="#CCCCCC"> about four and a half full</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">network will rely heavily on network</font>

28
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,350
tools so the tools that we are using is

29
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,090
a homegrown suite of software to

30
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,298
basically capture all information about

31
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network we've developed this piece</font>

32
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,950
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> software over the course of about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

33
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,270
last three and a half years and the main

34
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,220
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why I'm doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation</font>

35
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,740
is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're applying to open source</font>

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,500
it we've talked with some of the other

37
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,479
regional research networks in Canada so

38
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,380
as in other parts of the world and they

39
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,940
seem to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite interested in it so we</font>

40
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,070
rewrote parts of it and we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

41
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,929
the last legal details to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it open</font>

42
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,548
source so this presentation is basically

43
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,400
to introduce it to the larger community

44
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:08,160
and hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys are interested</font>

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,979
and want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out and maybe help us</font>

46
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,060
develop it further so basically it's all

47
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,959
a it<font color="#E5E5E5"> relies heavily on PHP MySQL and a</font>

48
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:22,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">part c and some of the other well-known</font>

49
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:25,019
tools such as rd to my school you can

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,489
use nagios plugins to you can use any of

51
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:29,030
your existing nagios plugins to your

52
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:31,799
monitoring if you have optical equipment

53
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,530
you can do you steal one tool kit which

54
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:38,459
is a pro library i wrote co-wrote with

55
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,590
someone else to moisture optical devices

56
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,720
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cell object-oriented</font>

57
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">api in PHP but there's also throw</font>

58
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,680
libraries that

59
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,659
fight much of the same functionality in

60
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,269
pro and it also has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-in framework</font>

61
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,940
that allows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to easily extend the</font>

62
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:55,260
software so what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in the</font>

63
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">remainder of the presentation is just</font>

64
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,409
quickly go over most of the

65
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,200
functionality or some of it because

66
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:02,579
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a few in it this is what</font>

67
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you log in this is the</font>

68
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:08,010
dashboard you can see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sub menus</font>

69
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:10,110
on on the top bar there's a search bar

70
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,030
you can basically search for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

71
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">things you can fill in interfaces</font>

72
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,200
customer names IP addresses a s numbers

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,160
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will show you all the</font>

74
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,500
information it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that you see</font>

75
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,829
also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of dashboard widgets you</font>

76
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,629
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily create your own widget really</font>

77
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,959
takes about five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have</font>

78
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:32,608
moderate PHP skills you can move those

79
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,709
around you can add them delete them

80
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:38,609
things like that which is that come out

81
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:40,530
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box are a IP calculator there's</font>

82
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:42,780
some audit trail you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see who changed</font>

83
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,030
what added what things like that some

84
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,370
statistics<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what's in the database</font>

85
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,510
how many devices customer recent event

86
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:55,940
changes and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a BGP mom</font>

87
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:58,108
waited this one so some of the features

88
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,940
devices so when you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> building out a</font>

89
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:01,769
network one of the main thing of course

90
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,139
is devices so we document all our

91
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:06,090
devices in there you can add the<font color="#CCCCCC"> physis</font>

92
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">device types you give them names so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

93
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,269
kind of standard stuff you can also

94
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:14,668
enable it for SNMP polling and it will

95
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,260
start to detect all the interfaces IP

96
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:20,090
addresses all that kind of stuff it will

97
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:23,280
start to automatically automatically do

98
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:25,590
statistics collections and you can also

99
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,840
do a password management in there so you

100
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,409
can add passwords for device or any

101
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:35,369
other private type of information and

102
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,810
that's a es encrypted in the database so

103
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's some security in there as well</font>

104
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,580
it also does automatic<font color="#E5E5E5"> treshold warning</font>

105
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,169
so if you go over high-water mark of

106
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,699
ninety percent or there's errors and

107
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:46,440
interfaces it will automatically sent

108
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,599
you an email address or an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

109
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to do much for that when you</font>

110
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:52,500
click on a device you see multiple tabs

111
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">I just selected the middle tab here</font>

112
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,070
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows you all the interfaces all</font>

113
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

114
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,280
you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information this mouse</font>

115
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,500
overs that you can see the statistics

116
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can click on that and then it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

117
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,650
similar as in cacti and you can zoom in

118
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:09,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">and things like that as well also when</font>

119
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you add a new interface and your logical</font>

120
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,210
interface that's all automatically

121
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,430
detected change interface description

122
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,260
all that kind of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay other things</font>

123
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,510
you need to do is location management so

124
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:22,050
we use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to store details about all our</font>

125
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:24,420
location or our pop sites locations have

126
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,910
different rooms so you can have

127
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:29,910
different room types you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can add contact</font>

128
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,400
information such a security or emergency

129
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:36,180
contact which brings us to contact

130
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,859
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to store</font>

131
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,780
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the contact information for</font>

132
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:44,820
either clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors suppliers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Spears</font>

133
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:47,549
anything so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can create</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> new contacts</font>

134
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:50,159
complexes of a certain type and that's

135
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,190
all flexible to configure once you have

136
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">a contacts let's say one of your playing</font>

137
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:58,040
partners<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google whatever and then</font>

138
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,780
underneath<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you can actually create</font>

139
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,820
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> objects and then you can add in</font>

140
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,219
the lead persons you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> reuse them all</font>

141
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the place as for one of the other</font>

142
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,680
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for is IP address</font>

143
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,880
management ipv4 as well as ipv6 it's a

144
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,980
think is pretty unique because there's

145
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,560
not too many open-source ipv6 address

146
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:19,470
managers out there and we also use it

147
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,570
for VLAN management I hope you can see

148
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:25,680
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a screenshot of the IP</font>

149
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:27,719
manager in this case ipv6 it has a lot

150
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,930
of javascript ajax in it to make it look

151
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice and interactive you can collapse</font>

152
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,570
this has different colors for if it's

153
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:38,250
assigned or reserved or<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like that</font>

154
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,800
if you hover over it over it you see the

155
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">details in the bottom of the screen if</font>

156
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">you click</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on it to get a modal window</font>

157
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:52,680
and you can assign it to a location to a

158
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:56,430
contact things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that once you've had</font>

159
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,750
once you have devices locations contacts

160
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,120
all that kind of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

161
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,310
start configuring network services and

162
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,530
that's where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all comes together so</font>

163
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:07,140
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it a network service in</font>

164
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,638
our case for example could be a BGP

165
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,188
peering with a customer or

166
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,650
if we land throughout the network or bgp

167
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:15,719
pyramid with<font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft for example well</font>

168
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,969
that's a typical service you can create

169
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:19,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> surface types and that's where</font>

170
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:22,139
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> glue it all together so you say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

171
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,289
service this bgp service is configured

172
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:28,770
on device one in vancouver it's for

173
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:31,050
customer or<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft it's on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

174
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:34,258
device is some this interface these are

175
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,759
the bgp info this is the bgp information

176
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,949
these are the prefixes i'm sending i'm

177
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,259
expecting IP addresses all the kind of

178
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:42,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff the nice thing is also doing first</font>

179
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,039
service statistics collection so if you

180
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,379
ever move a client around to another

181
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:47,969
device or whatever you won't lose any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

182
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:50,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">the historical data because it's using</font>

183
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:52,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the service ideas the key we've seen</font>

184
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the past a lot zone that's nice</font>

185
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:57,029
you know per service monitoring we have

186
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,099
a customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> portal where it feeds into</font>

187
00:07:57,029 --> 00:08:02,029
because you associated each service to a

188
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:05,188
customer customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> only sees its own</font>

189
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:07,770
services you can generate reports all

190
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:09,569
that kind of stuff one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

191
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,430
also use it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> is event management or</font>

192
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:13,589
monitoring and reporting and in this

193
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,020
case reporting is in bold<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

194
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:18,029
main thing we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it for is</font>

195
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:21,029
reporting we use intermap are mainly for

196
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:24,120
monitoring but it doesn't doesn't have a

197
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:25,830
good features for for reporting so

198
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,360
basically it's heavily inspired on the

199
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,490
nagios framework which means that you

200
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,839
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> use existing nagios plugins</font>

201
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:35,880
including performance data and again we

202
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,289
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for reporting mainly so at the</font>

203
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,140
end of the month we can report<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

204
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:42,539
network services for example transit

205
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,640
availability in<font color="#E5E5E5"> vancouver we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buy transit</font>

206
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,350
from three different providers we

207
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,459
monitor all three of those and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then at</font>

208
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,980
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the month we group them</font>

209
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,779
together as one service and then there's

210
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,970
some logic that allows you to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

211
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:55,529
how do you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor or report on</font>

212
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,180
these services together so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

213
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:59,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay one was down then the whole service</font>

214
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,140
is down or as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as once up all the</font>

215
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:02,699
whole services consider this off which

216
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,170
is what we want in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

217
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:07,469
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> providers so up the whole</font>

218
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,750
service still up or you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take</font>

219
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the average so whatever there's a lot of</font>

220
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">different things you can do with</font>

221
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:17,040
reporting there and that's quite nice

222
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,860
again there's a number of plugins and

223
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,000
dashboards which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> available very</font>

224
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:26,209
famous<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdp to pay traffic</font>

225
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,000
we use it for traffic accounting till

226
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:31,430
one plugins change manager there's a few

227
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,200
of those available I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

228
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,589
almost a<font color="#E5E5E5"> life slide so this is what you</font>

229
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:40,250
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> for checks or event management's on</font>

230
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:41,810
the left you see the check details you

231
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,519
create a check template where you say

232
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,010
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> nagios</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plug-in you want to use and</font>

233
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,360
then again it starts really reusing much

234
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,950
of the information you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

235
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">device it already knows the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SNMP</font>

236
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,130
information or some of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

237
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,130
on the right hand side you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the</font>

238
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:59,120
recent events in at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom you see</font>

239
00:09:54,130 --> 00:10:00,920
performance data again this was really

240
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">quick overview of the functionalities</font>

241
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,510
there's way more in there but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

242
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,980
show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that this is the URL where</font>

243
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,319
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can find more information there's</font>

244
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,480
more screenshots videos and<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

245
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,970
information it's currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

246
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,279
evaluated by a number of networks and we

247
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,800
hope that you know some of you might be

248
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:21,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested as well and want to give it a</font>

249
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,540
try and hopefully work with us to make

250
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:28,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">it an even better solution so if you</font>

251
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,510
interested please let us know thank you

252
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,439
Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Andre any any quick questions</font>

253
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,529
I'm very interesting thank you thank you

254
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:49,629
ok the next lightning talk that we have

255
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:51,819
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be Jim Martin from ISC Jim</font>

256
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:53,860
he's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about by nine and you</font>

257
00:10:51,819 --> 00:11:05,229
are buying<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 and using buying 10 and</font>

258
00:10:53,860 --> 00:11:07,509
production there we go so hi I'm Jim

259
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,160
Martin I'm from ISC and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font>

260
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:10,629
you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit about some experience</font>

261
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,059
we experiments we've been doing with

262
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:15,970
bind<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 trying to get some reality into</font>

263
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:17,829
it so for any of you who aren't familiar

264
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,019
with it mine 10 has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been sort of a</font>

265
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:22,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">long-term</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> planned replacement for by</font>

266
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:24,939
nine it's been largely in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lab for</font>

267
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:26,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first three years of its life and</font>

268
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:28,329
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to actually give it a</font>

269
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,800
little bit of reality a dose of<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality</font>

270
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:31,989
to see if it actually is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

271
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,149
the way it's supposed to the thought was

272
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:37,120
what we'll do is we'll start throwing a

273
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:38,949
s112 data at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because if we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

274
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,800
will it's a decent<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of real</font>

275
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:43,059
variable day-to-day traffic without it

276
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,008
being something that we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

277
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:46,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">knock down services if we were to</font>

278
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:48,610
withdraw it so it seemed like a

279
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:49,929
relatively<font color="#E5E5E5"> low risk we found that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

280
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,499
wasn't quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> as low as because we had</font>

hoped but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll walk you through that the</font>

282
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:57,699

283
00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:00,069
that the authoritative portion of mine

00:11:57,699 --> 00:12:04,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 is very close to user</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> test and so</font>

285
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:07,540
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first steps so as we</font>

286
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:09,339
started we got handed off from the from

287
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">the software engineering team a bundle</font>

00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:12,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> code they said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go and</font>

289
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:16,139
stall it yourself it all worked great

290
00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:18,729
yeah it's a very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> raw still we're</font>

291
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:20,079
between the dependencies and the

292
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,249
documentation there were a lot of things

293
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we were able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back and forth</font>

294
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:27,459
and try to have the operational aspect

295
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:31,689
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> influence things but finally</font>

296
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:33,790
dated up put the normal line is he's

297
00:12:31,689 --> 00:12:36,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">been running a 112 server for a while so</font>

298
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:41,620
we just flipped the traffic pointing at

299
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:43,120
the vine<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 server and it died when we</font>

300
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,340
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a little bit it was it was a</font>

301
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,870
it was entirely a performance thing the

302
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,030
box just could not handle the<font color="#E5E5E5"> load that</font>

303
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,480
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> given we saw that we were seeing</font>

304
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:54,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">about 50,000 queries a second the old by</font>

305
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,890
nine on a old piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware was</font>

306
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,120
doing just fine the buying<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 on a</font>

307
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,760
relatively new piece of hardware

308
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,430
couldn't handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and we went back and</font>

309
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,540
we had a bit of a chat with the software

310
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,189
engineering guys they said oh yeah

311
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:11,230
performance yeah we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> really look</font>

312
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:12,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">at that and so once once we did that we</font>

313
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,610
we tried to see if there was anything we

314
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,920
could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> no not really so we basically</font>

315
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,500
bailed out flip back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> by nine</font>

316
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,550
server and said yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys go off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

317
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,220
figure out what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do to make this</font>

318
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:27,609
actually work that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> three four months</font>

319
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:30,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago then a month or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two ago we tried it</font>

320
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:32,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">one more time the good news is that with</font>

321
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">the gentle nudge of having utterly and</font>

322
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,300
completely failed they went back and did

323
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,130
some performance improvements and found

324
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,979
that they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to with without</font>

325
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,090
changing the architecture at all without

326
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,680
messing with any of the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

327
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,640
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing but rather just going</font>

328
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,560
through and doing the obvious

329
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,939
optimizations they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it</font>

330
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,099
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point where it's at the same</font>

331
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,060
level as by nine there's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> work to</font>

332
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,380
be done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're planning on</font>

333
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:58,449
continuing to do work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the by nine</font>

334
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,210
level performance allowed us to put it

335
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,880
back into<font color="#CCCCCC"> production so we were going to</font>

336
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:06,310
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into production and but the the</font>

337
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,220
last experience caused us to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

338
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:11,500
uncomfortable with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and so we set it</font>

339
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,030
up with a by nine sort of the existing

340
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,220
by nine server as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as the new buying</font>

341
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,689
tensor or a CMP between the two figured

342
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:20,140
out that's a little bit of lesser load

343
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:23,830
give it a better chance it did just<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine</font>

344
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:27,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we then dropped dropped the by nine</font>

345
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:29,890
server out seem to be doing just fine we

346
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:34,449
did look and though that the traffic

347
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:36,670
load had gone from on the order of on

348
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:40,270
the order of 50,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> queries a second to</font>

349
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:42,280
about 15,000 queries a second so where

350
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:44,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really came from was somebody</font>

351
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,540
somebody out here<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably stood up</font>

352
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,160
another a s112 server somewhere around

353
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,959
packs and sucked off a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

354
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">traffic that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had been getting so</font>

355
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,370
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to establish that it is able</font>

356
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to handle a reasonable load but not</font>

357
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,220
quite below that we originally had but

358
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,000
then

359
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:04,310
it went wrong we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting abuse</font>

360
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,060
reports coming in and couldn't quite

361
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:10,189
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what was going on then ended</font>

362
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,640
up in a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of packet dumps took a</font>

363
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:16,190
look and realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> while the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind 10</font>

364
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:19,130

365
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,780
responding appropriately and sending

366

those out when they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending them</font>

367
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:25,910
out it was coming in on the 112 anycast

368

address and going back out on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

369
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:31,579
interface address it hadn't really

370
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:34,280
occurred to the buying<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 guys that you</font>

371
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,290
might need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to preserve that so the</font>

372
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,180
perception<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a first of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all we were we</font>

were managing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a disservice to the</font>

375
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:44,479
answering getting answers to their

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,230
everybody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDS's because they saw these</font>

378
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,140
as unrequested packets coming from the

379
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,150
outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> world so the good news is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

380
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:57,080
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work and come up with a</font>

381
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:57,980
quick hack to get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed and but</font>

382
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,180
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some architectural changes</font>

383
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:03,530
that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need to go back</font>

384
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:09,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">and really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at the end result</font>

385
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:11,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">though is that we have a running</font>

386
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,520
production server at this point it is

387
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,810
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are no there are no</font>

388
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,630
current open issues with the

389
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:20,209
configuration it's seeing day to day

390
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:22,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic and the engineering folks are</font>

391
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:26,470
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to use as a basis for</font>

392
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:28,849
building a building future work and

393
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:31,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">ultimately though this is meant as a</font>

394
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,950
first step towards user testing and so

395
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,930
really the main reason me mentioning

396
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,210
this is a admitting that yes we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

397
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">our challenges but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also we're making</font>

398
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">some real progress to getting this out</font>

399
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:44,540
there and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a nudge to you guys</font>

400
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,580
saying that later this fall we're going

401
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be doing public tests with this where</font>

402
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,660
we're going to be asking for folks to be

403
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,030
looking at this for authoritative

404
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:55,130
servers and we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like some</font>

405
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:58,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">feedback if you want to play even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

406
00:16:55,130 --> 00:17:03,380
then there is the bind pen list there on

407
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:05,240
the on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slide but the alt the upshot</font>

408
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,829
of all of this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in fact it is</font>

409
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,349
binding is out there it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in production</font>

410
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:11,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we're looking forward to having you</font>

411
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:17,889
guys help us out do some testing

412
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:17,889
any questions all right thanks much

413
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:27,620
thank you Jim and then next up is going

414
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:30,909
to be Tom Daley<font color="#CCCCCC"> from dying and he's</font>

415
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:30,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about weird</font>

416
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,820
good morning everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm Tom Daley</font>

417
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:54,269
I'm with dine I will say right up front

418
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,489
that I don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose these names</font>

419
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:59,529
but weirds is something that looks and

420
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:01,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">feels like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a who is two point oh I've</font>

421
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:03,759
been collaborating with two colleagues

422
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:05,440
from dine Alex<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sergei of and Andrew</font>

423
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:09,249
Sullivan on this work and we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

424
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,169
introduce the nanog community to what

425
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:15,840
the IETF is doing with weirds but also

426
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:18,489
what dine is doing with weirds so I

427
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,139
hired<font color="#E5E5E5"> an intern this summer to come look</font>

428
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:23,080
at weirds with us and he sent me this

429
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:26,469
email and it was why you know use modern

430
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,059
protocols and that was directly going

431
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to the fact that who is is just</font>

432
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:35,049
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really old in the first place it</font>

433
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:39,190
was defined in RFC a 12 that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> defined</font>

434
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:40,899
in 1982 and it was primarily designed to

435
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:45,909
contain contact information about

436
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:47,918
networks it used us<font color="#E5E5E5"> ASCII text it didn't</font>

437
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:49,690
have it defined data format of any sort

438
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,359
it has no support for

439
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:53,889
internationalization and it was

440
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:56,918
essentially designed as a text<font color="#E5E5E5"> based</font>

441
00:18:53,889 --> 00:19:01,059
protocol with the human consumer in mind

442
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:02,440
not computer systems as a consumer<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

443
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:05,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">Whois protocol was then rolled forward</font>

444
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,279
in 1990 into the basis of domain name

445
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,690
registration contact information and

446
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:13,779
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just something that tends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

447
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:15,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">pretty painful for us all today you know</font>

448
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:18,700
who's written a who is parser in the

449
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:21,700
room right<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I should see a lot of</font>

450
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,950
hands go up and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it dine it's</font>

451
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,989
something like who is is 37 and our

452
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,789
intern program is like minus<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 or</font>

453
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:32,080
something like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

454
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:33,249
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun at all so the IETF has a</font>

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group that's working on</font>

456
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:38,559
something called weirds and weirds

457
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,350
really drafts upon a lot of the work

458
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,908
that's already going on at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR level</font>

459
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,730
particularly an errand in the ripe

460
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:47,850
regions with bringing modern protocol

461
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:51,519
capabilities to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> who is so</font>

462
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:54,340
essentially forklift upgrading<font color="#E5E5E5"> this raw</font>

465
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,610

467
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:05,290

478
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,918
for at this point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know help</font>

479
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:38,290
standardizing how this protocol is going

480
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,059
to work ideally from sane people but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

481
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,470
necessarily saying people who know

482
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:44,590
something about operations and have a

483
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,910
need of the data because and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

484
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,860
at all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in this room we certainly</font>

485
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:51,010
need this data in our anti-abuse work

486
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,928
that we do day in and day out so you

487
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:56,559
know what are the benefits for domain

488
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:58,900
names with weirds well weirds really

489
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,059
handles the strong management of the

490
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,280
registry registrar and registrant model

491
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:05,950
from day one something that who is

492
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,168
struggles with so it handles referrals

493
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,450
gracefully because you can essentially

494
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:14,140
represent a delegated object in the

495
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:16,960
hierarchy with just yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uri it</font>

496
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:20,110
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> defines a common data model with</font>

497
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,970
data labels so a person actually gets

498
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,428
labeled as a person a role gets labeled

499
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,809
as a role<font color="#E5E5E5"> that should help you as you're</font>

500
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:27,760
parsing this data so that way you can

501
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:29,770
reach out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to other networks or build</font>

502
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,330
geolocation databases or however you use

503
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:34,150
who is data it supports

504
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:37,559
internationalization for both the domain

505
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:40,480
itself and registrant information and

506
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:41,918
using things like HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication we</font>

507
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,470
get things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like class of service</font>

508
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,600
differentiation to various types of

509
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,630
users of the interface so you know who

510
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,600
is only has one flavor of service today

511
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:55,600
it's the anonymous based interface

512
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,580
running weirds over HTTP or<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS would</font>

513
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,379
actually support authentication you

514
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:03,159
could give different data based upon

515
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:05,980
who's asking so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry this isn't</font>

516
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:09,730
zoomed in more but if you can see the

517
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:12,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">output</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this this is a typical domain</font>

518
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:15,430
name registration

519
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,490
is being output in who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our excuse me</font>

520
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:20,710
in weirds format as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON object so</font>

521
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:23,710
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is incredibly machine readable and</font>

522
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:25,510
parsable that's kind of nice so that's

523
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:29,290
for a regular domain registration and

524
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:32,260
then for at dine we run a free dynamic

525
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:34,750
dns service this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a free dynamic dns</font>

526

of exposing so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are our interests</font>

530
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,620
right so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our customers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font>

531
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,240
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're able to support</font>

532
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,500
their internationalized domains and

00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,200
their internationalized contact

534
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:56,080
information for their registrants from

535
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,000
the anti-abuse perspective we want to be

536
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,350
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensure that you know people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

537

are doing data collection or research

538
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:04,030
have a very easy machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> parsable way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

539
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,280
get this data we think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will help</font>

540
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,560
speed our abuse desk response times and

541
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,430
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> even on the privacy front remember</font>

542
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,030
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking about different</font>

543
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:15,460
classes of service well weird provides a

544
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:17,800
framework so that way if you anonymously

545
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,750
come query the service maybe you don't

546
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,820
get the full contact information because

547
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,530
maybe you don't need it whereas if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

548
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,090
are an authenticated user you can have

549
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,590
the full contact information about

550
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,030
something something we're certainly

551
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:32,220
exploring that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a whole</font>

552
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:34,780
different talk so our next steps is to

553
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,880
finish the development of a weirds

554
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:39,430
implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will be posted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up on</font>

555
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,920
our github page so monitor that and we

556
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:45,460
will eventually offer a experimental

557
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:47,200
implementation at who is Dean DNS com we

558
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,850
will put some data<font color="#E5E5E5"> from both our free</font>

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,150
dynamic dns host names in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there as well</font>

560
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:54,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">as registered domain names and that's</font>

561
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:57,780
about it thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for listening to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

have an extra lightning talk and it's

567
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:25,210
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be Patrick Gilmore in high def</font>

568
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:27,539
talking about world ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> launch hi</font>

569
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:32,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody I'm Patrick this is tigger</font>

570
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:35,379
where's the thing there it is so welcome

571
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">to world ipv6 launch date I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> glad</font>

572
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:47,350
you're all still here and the planet

573
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:48,850
earth did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not implode there we go so</font>

574
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,459
these stats are very very fresh<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

575
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:54,580
literally pulled them out at between<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

576
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,620
45 and nine a.m. this<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning haven't</font>

577
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,879
gotten everything there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was some legal</font>

578
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,739
requirements that i couldn't give

579
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,880
everything out some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

580
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do press releases with other</font>

581
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,049
people and strangely our lawyers don't

582
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:08,409
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say everything but i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got some</font>

583
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:09,850
data so let's see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it looked like so</font>

584
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:13,299
just so that everybody understands we do

585
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:15,969
have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people on ipv6 it turns</font>

586
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:19,149
out a lot lot more than we had last year

587
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:21,429
on ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> launched sorry on ipv6 day as</font>

588
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:23,110
opposed to launch day some stats that we

589
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:24,519
are allowed to give out over 700

590
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:27,519
government sites on 21 different

591
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:29,440
agencies one-third of the top 30 world<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

592
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:32,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">b6 launch day participants if you do</font>

593
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,809
them by alexa rank that<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the way is a</font>

594
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:38,019
company based obviously not individual

595
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:39,610
page based so point is that we do

596
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:41,500
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some real data to show</font>

597
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:45,279
here there's a lot of customers on our

598
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:47,559
site on our system using v6 and just so

599
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you understand there's actually</font>

600
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:52,240
more v6 now than there used to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font>

601
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,460
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going up quite rapidly there's</font>

602
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,710
actually some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sites have you know</font>

603
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,779
one and a half percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> on v6 native and</font>

604
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,159
that's compared to what it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year</font>

605
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:02,639
compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what it was you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know two</font>

606
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">months ago that's actually quite a bit</font>

607
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:07,240
so a little bit of what we've been

608
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,149
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do we try to dual stack every</font>

609
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:12,250
single server every single Akamai server

610
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:14,678
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> has the ability to dual stack</font>

611
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,629
strangely not every network does we

612
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:17,740
succeeded in getting 53 countries that

613
00:26:16,629 --> 00:26:20,889
was as of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Monday my</font>

614
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,750
been one or two more by now on<font color="#E5E5E5"> over 200</font>

615
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">network providers realize that we have</font>

616
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,679
servers in over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,100 network providers</font>

617
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:28,840
so people say things like the backbone

618
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:30,520
or the network's easy to do it's the end

619
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,040
user or the website or whatever that's

620
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,780
hard to do turns out that most of the

621
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,330
backbones and networks actually have not

622
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:39,399
v6 ified themselves so all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff</font>

623
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,780
about the ISPs already it's just the

624
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,240
users or the web sites that aren't ready

625
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:45,160
that's incorrect there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of ISPs</font>

626
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,970
that are not ready and even some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

627
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:50,200
VIS PS it gave us v6 they said hey what

628
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,190
you have v6 here you go and then we

629
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,429
tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out and it turned out they</font>

630
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:59,200
didn't have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of v6 and so hilarity</font>

631
00:26:54,429 --> 00:27:01,059
ensued some graphs some of these graphs

632
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,580
are Martin levy style<font color="#CCCCCC"> in other words</font>

633
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:06,399
they don't have any axes sorry that's

634
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:09,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way life is I just pulled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font>

635
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,290
HTTP only we have a dedicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl where</font>

636
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,750
if you have a customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> owned cert you</font>

637
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,610
can put it into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your into the Akamai</font>

638
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,660
system I didn't include those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font>

639
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,360
include streaming you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

640
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,429
quick just let's get it it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

641
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,469
ten to twenty percent more than HTTP by

642
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:25,270
itself so this should give you at least

643
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,790
a order of magnitude an idea of what's

644
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:30,190
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you understand the</font>

645
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:33,220
traffic earlier this week before today

646
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:35,920
was over 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> times as much v6 traffic as</font>

647
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:37,450
it was last year on v6 day so we really

648
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">have gotten you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean a couple</font>

649
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,290
orders of magnitude more traffic it

650
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:45,970
actually is significant now or as I like

651
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:49,178
to say it's measurable so the red line

652
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:51,190
is midnight UTC as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see we had a</font>

653
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:56,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">massive increase right now wait a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minute</font>

654
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:59,320
no we didn't oops yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a whole</font>

655
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot happened it turns out everybody was</font>

656
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,960
v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> of finding themselves before launch</font>

657
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:06,820
day this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good thing and user didn't</font>

658
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,490
notice there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was a</font>

659
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:12,159
non-event this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome so let's back</font>

660
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:14,679
this up a little bit I think the battery

661
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dying here sorry you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't actually</font>

662
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:18,370
see it because it's slow there the grid

663
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,110
actually is days<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a better way</font>

664
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:22,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at it as each peak is a day and</font>

665
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,399
you can tell when big customers came on

666
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,290
the system it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out</font>

667
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">is it</font>

668
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:32,930
anybody want to guess when Facebook came

669
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:35,480
are moving on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually if you go</font>

670
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:38,720
to akamai calm / ipv6 you can actually

671
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">get this is a live</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open graph</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

672
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">i balled</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the red line here because it's</font>

673
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:44,780
not very well put up but it's

674
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,350
approximately midnight as you can see

675
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">even this only shows hits not megabits</font>

676
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:53,750
but it gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actual hits as you can</font>

677
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:57,260
see nothing there is the data here the

678
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:59,390
first look for ipv6 is that it was a

679
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:02,030
non-event we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> these six before we</font>

680
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:04,670
have v6 now everybody's happy is just

681
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:07,490
works the only interesting thing about

682
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:10,010
the hits is this is the overall hits and

683
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:12,080
you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> akamai tom / ipv6</font>

684
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:21,590
and click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these things yourself this</font>

685
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:23,379
is overall and then North America North

686
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,459
America is about 75% of the hits

687
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,890
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> occupies a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service provider</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

688
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:30,470
do whatever people tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to do so</font>

689
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:32,420
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some customers there are some</font>

690
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,100
countries<font color="#CCCCCC"> and things like that where v6</font>

691
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:37,010
is pulled back either for performance

692
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:39,379
breakage or whatever reasons turns out

693
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:42,140
North America at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our data set</font>

694
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,090
which I admitted somewhat<font color="#CCCCCC"> us centric but</font>

695
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,470
not one hundred percent us-centric turns

696
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,760
out North America is a little more ready

697
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,460
than some of the other countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

698
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,650
the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> even some countries that say</font>

699
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,750
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really ready like maybe</font>

700
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:58,390
Japan or something they've had v6 for a

701
00:29:53,750 --> 00:30:00,530
long time have a lot of breakage and I

702
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:03,890
went backwards I think that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

703
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:06,500

the Canadian government that it would be

739
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:29,570
a full 10 megabits per second so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>
