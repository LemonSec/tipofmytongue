1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:04,798
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay folks so let's go ahead and get</font>

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:07,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">started for the afternoon session first</font>

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:15,480
up we have Joker's presenting the rover

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:18,570
talk a good afternoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm Joe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gersh from</font>

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,789
secure 64 I'm also representing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dan</font>

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,400
masse from Colorado State University as

7
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,340
well as Mike Glenn and Chris garner from

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,609
Centrelink the topic is route origin

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,219
verification a way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing BGP route</font>

10
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,010
origins checking out whether they're

11
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:41,760
valid or invalid and using that doing

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:43,680
that mechanism using<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS basically the</font>

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,570
idea here is to have a lightweight

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,640
method for checking BGP origins the

15
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:53,190
purpose of course I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're all</font>

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,320
are aware of IP hijacking but there's

17
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,820
also IP fat fingering and other things

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">that go on so it can also help prevent</font>

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,449
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the just mistakes that can</font>

20
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,670
happen out there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a number of</font>

21
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">techniques for doing IP hijacks but we</font>

22
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,280
are just focusing today on origin

23
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:10,500
hijacks and sub prefix hijacks we're not

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,939
looking at full bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex security we're</font>

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,040
not looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at path we're not looking at</font>

26
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">man in the middle but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically what can</font>

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,340
be done in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lightweight manner to</font>

28
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,950
prevent the origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sub prefix</font>

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,650
hijacks in some ways people might first

30
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,060
say well is this like our<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

31
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,920
would say it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> complementary to it but</font>

32
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,150
it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there are some</font>

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,000
similarities but there are of course

34
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,000
many differences as well the similarity

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,369
is simply that like our<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki we classify</font>

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,829
route origins into three classes either

37
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're valid they're invalid or we</font>

38
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,919
can't say anything we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know because</font>

39
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,048
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was no data available to look it</font>

40
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,420
up the similarity pretty much stops

41
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,210
there after that for example we don't

42
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,009
use certificates we use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS to</font>

43
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,079
publish the data look it up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> use DNS</font>

44
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,780
SEC signatures as opposed to certificate

45
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,139
chains we also don't have an enumeration

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,149
policy we basically you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a prefix in</font>

47
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,130
you go look it up as a go it's a it's a

48
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:03,869
go ask a question go get an answer

49
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,250
mechanism so there's a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

50
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,140
differences and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

51
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,818
architecture to show how this all plays

52
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,318
together so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is meant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

53
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">general introduction to what is it all</font>

54
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,119
about I can't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into great depth on all</font>

55
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,709
the

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">tails but i can give you pointers to</font>

57
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:18,849
where you can get more information

58
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's basically in this lightweight</font>

59
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:25,839
scheme just<font color="#CCCCCC"> two basic categories of</font>

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,239
topics one is how do you publish the

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,799
data and once it's published what do you

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,970
do with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you access it how do</font>

63
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:33,909
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to it what do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do with it</font>

64
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:35,799
when it's there so publishing we use an

65
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:37,840
already existing infrastructure the

66
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:41,370
reverse<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS so everything that's based</font>

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">in in a drawer ARPA or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP 6 DARPA and</font>

68
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,760
again as I mentioned earlier we don't

69
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:47,500
use certificate chains we use the

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,840
already existing and already deployed

71
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,510
DNS SEC architectures so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

72
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,819
validate the data we get back with the

73
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,709
signature and if the ad bit is set we

74
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:58,480
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically say this is an authentic</font>

75
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:00,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece of data because it's been</font>

76
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,230
validated against the DNS SEC chain of

77
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,810
trust as opposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a certificate chain</font>

78
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,399
of trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't mean it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to</font>

79
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,569
just say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's put the data in</font>

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,760
reverse DNS because there's some

81
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:10,839
interesting issues with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show</font>

82
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,290
you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a minute when we go to the</font>

83
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,209
publishing side but the second part<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

84
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,358
once the data is there what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

85
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:21,220
with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you access it should it can</font>

86
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:23,139
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in the control plane should</font>

87
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,280
have just<font color="#E5E5E5"> inform operators that</font>

88
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:26,440
something's interesting going on and the

89
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,060
answer is yeah a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

90
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">applications can be built</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and so</font>

91
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,120
I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to show some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them in fact</font>

92
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:33,190
one of them was talked about yesterday

93
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,530
by Shane amante from level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

94
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,530
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about looking at verifying</font>

95
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:41,829
prefix filters looking at the IR and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

96
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:43,209
forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and up and looking at his validity</font>

97
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:45,329
by comparing it to information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

98
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:48,579
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be published</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the reverse DNS</font>

99
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:51,459
the design model is probably familiar

100
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:53,560
when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the IP hourglass model we</font>

101
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:54,790
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a strong long foundation of things</font>

102
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,109
that are already there<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the base</font>

103
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:04,660
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are their dns DNS</font>

104
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:06,579
SEC all the redundancy the zone

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,470
transfers the<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time update</font>

106
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,209
capability it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been</font>

107
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,760
out there for 20-some years and people

108
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,230
know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with it so our project</font>

109
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,570
originally began with love it's already

110
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,209
there can we use it as a mechanism to

111
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,769
have a worldwide distribution publishing

112
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,560
mechanism if you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a valid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

113
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:25,659
table if that's a word mechanism to say

114
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,350
what are the route origins associated

115
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:29,110
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the particular</font>

116
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,820
prefix so the wide base at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the hourglass is this foundational</font>

118
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,750
aspects of things that already exist

00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,820
it's there<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's deployed why don't we</font>

120
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,090
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of it at the neck of the</font>

121
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:43,480
hourglass we wanted a very small set of

122
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,580
access methods basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what is</font>

123
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,560
the naming scheme and what is the record

124
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,940
scheme for publishing the information in

125
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,240
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS so that you can have</font>

126
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:55,030
applications do a dig or go get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

127
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,230
answer to a particular query keeping it

small knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it can be</font>

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:04,300
is making the the actual mechanisms for

131
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,500
over itself quite small it also is a

132
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,780
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to point out a</font>

133
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,190
best-effort retrieval some people say

134
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,260
well if you're going to go ask DNS a

135
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,910
question how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you actually</font>

136
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">got the answer and the answer is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font>

137
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:18,430
got three states when you go ask DNS a

138
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,229
question and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something back it's</font>

139
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,210
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be valid or invalid you</font>

140
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,860
either know for example if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for a</font>

141
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,659
particular prefix it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

142
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,250

145
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,910
published and I can prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with DNS</font>

SEC or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third is I'm still waiting</font>

147
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,660
for the answer there was a failure a

148
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,909
software something happened that you

149
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,740
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an answer back at all this is</font>

150
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">very similar to the IP stack this is</font>

guaranteed retrievable<font color="#CCCCCC"> its best effort</font>

153
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,820
which means in the access methods and

154
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">the level up above you can actually have</font>

155
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,760
exponential retries things like that

156
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,980
because if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think something's going</font>

157
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong you can try over and over again to</font>

159
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,480
something looks wrong so there are

160
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">various schemes that can be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> built on top</font>

161
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,890
of that finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> we open up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the hourglass</font>

162
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,420
wide again and we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at what</font>

163
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,039
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do with the data once it's</font>

164

published<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show a couple of</font>

165
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,160
applications but in particular you could

166
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,410
verify routing databases like in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRR</font>

167
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,970
this is wrong it says bill prefix list

168
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,800
it's actually verify prefix lists of

169
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,660
what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should say you can interface</font>

170
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,850
to the RTR mechanism that's in an RFC

171
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,410
already you could actually do real-time

172
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,880
notifications that's the one I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

showing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact if I go back a</font>

175
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,010
me show that actually this one right

176
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,410
here there's a map of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world this was</font>

177
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:38,050
an actual monitoring application where

178
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,729
we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> btp announcements coming in from</font>

179
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,309
40 monitors around the world

180
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:44,620
every time an announcement came in we

181
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:46,569
did a DNS lookup to say is there any

182
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,330
data supporting this announcement is it

183
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:50,800
valid invalid or just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font>

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,599
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> several</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> millions of these things</font>

190
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,089
played an interesting experiment with me

says I will play a cat and mouse<font color="#CCCCCC"> game</font>

I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to flap a prefix I'm gonna</font>

193

00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,699
renounce them catch me<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you can so</font>

195
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:14,020
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually happened with this map I</font>

196
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,759
was looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the screen when all of a</font>

197
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,289
sudden little<font color="#E5E5E5"> flags started popping up</font>

198
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,300
saying oh it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten-thirty in the morning</font>

199
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:22,808
I think Shane's up to something within

200
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:25,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">one minute of his flapping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were</font>

201
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:26,409
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect has it propagated around</font>

202
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:29,490
the world over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the course of seven</font>

203
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:31,240
minutes the various invalid

204
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,430
announcements that were being propagated

205
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,409
and catch it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the map so son Shane and</font>

206
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,169
emails as gotcha so the cat mouse came

207
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:40,629
actually worked so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's an example of</font>

208
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:42,878
one application out of several<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

209
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:45,699
frankly the reason we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wide</font>

210
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,550
upper half of the hourglass is because

211
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:50,259
as we worked with different operators we

212
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,149
find that<font color="#CCCCCC"> CenturyLink doesn't want to do</font>

00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:54,249
what level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three does level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

214
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:56,020

215
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:57,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">Front Range</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet does there's a</font>

216
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,979
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean every operator every</font>

217
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:01,659
carrier has different operational

218
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,399
procedures and different mechanisms that

219
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:05,169
they run their shops so we wanted to

220
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a great deal of flexibility and how</font>

221
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:08,649
do you use this data and customize it to

222
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:10,839
the actual operations you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in place</font>

223
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:14,409
already instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a one size fits all</font>

224
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:16,899
type of application so let's start with

225
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:18,099
the simple part which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh I shouldn't</font>

226
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:19,719
say simple it's just the lightweight

227
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:23,949
part of how do you publish a route

228
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:26,620
origin in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reverse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS there's two</font>

229
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:29,439
things needed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first part is a naming</font>

230
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,479
scheme right now everyone knows the

231
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,729
reverse DNS can give an address for a

232
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:36,240
host device if an ipv4 world you just

233
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:40,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">reverse the digits of the octets and</font>

234
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:44,260
that's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 reverse DNS but how do</font>

235
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:46,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">you specify a / 16 or a / 17 or a / 18</font>

236
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,180
an actual sub preparedness an actual

237
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,149
prefix an address block a range of

238
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,109
addresses not just one host address so

239
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:56,170
the scheme here

240
00:08:53,110 --> 00:09:00,070
was an extension as for being proposed

241
00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:02,740
at the ITF to have a naming scheme where

242
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:07,660
we can have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a / 16 here in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

243
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:10,329
we have a / 18<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 2982 dot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 128 / 18</font>

244
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:13,149
basically if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the part of the</font>

245
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:15,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">right hand side there's the classical 82</font>

246
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:19,839
129 in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DARPA but there's also this M</font>

247
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:22,630
thing in there it says 01 m82 what is

248
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,459
that what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> M is all about says this</font>

249
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:28,480
is a indicator that we are now switching

250
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:31,149
to a mask mode a binary mode so the 82

251
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,649
129 that's the nearest octet but then

252
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:35,350
the am indicates we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are now switching</font>

253
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:36,970
the binary mode and then the one in the

254
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero that's basically how you would do</font>

255
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,290
128<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next bit down to 64 then 32 I</font>

256
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,050
think everybody here<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows binary and</font>

257
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,180
just in reverse order you can specify a

258
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:50,290
set of bits that tells you what your

259
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,939
next octet down to a / 18 17 to 19 20

260
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,250
all the way down so you can specify a

261
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,440
whole block<font color="#CCCCCC"> of addresses using the</font>

262
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,310
scheme I won't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into great detail here</font>

263
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,570
this is written<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft at the</font>

yourself in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a naming scheme</font>

272
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,260
because this is the real thing that

273
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,060
opens up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to start using the</font>

reverse dns having a naming scheme for

275

an address block means you can do a lot

287
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:49,660
these are not this is again a draft this

288
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,459
is proposed at the ITF these record

289

<font color="#E5E5E5">them in as examples</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're substituting</font>

292
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,449
we're not using<font color="#CCCCCC"> txt records but it's</font>

293
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,399
it's it's what we're currently using so

294
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:05,439
our lock says<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm opting in I have a</font>

295
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,250
zone I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to opt into this publishing</font>

296
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,350
mechanism I

297
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,210
to lock the zone that says deny

298
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:12,370
everything every prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that comes in</font>

299
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,170
unless I specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorize it with</font>

300
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,240
an SRO which stands for secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

301
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:18,459
origin so let's give an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

302
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that looks like here's Colorado State</font>

303
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:25,030
University they have 129 82 / 16 they

304
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,310
also make several announcement at / 18 s

305
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,860
and so there's the typical thing within

306
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:32,079
a durar to the 129 to the 82 delegation

307
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,540
and within that you'll see that there is

308
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,980
about four or five new records one is

309
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,449
the our lock statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

310
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,040
before this is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to put into</font>

311
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,050
the existing zone that's already at

312
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,910
Colorado State University and then

313
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,370
there's there's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ARLA are the SRO</font>

314
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,650
statement for the / 16 and there's for

315
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:50,950
SRO statements for the / 18s and that's

316
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:52,930
all that the university had to do to put

317
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,360
in the information for the prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

318
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,829
they want and 1<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 145 the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number there</font>

319
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,040
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s number that is their</font>

320
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:02,290

321
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,110
prefix now you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that the use of</font>

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:12,220
way of saying / 0 / 64 / 128 and so on

reversed also I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make note</font>

326
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,310
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little fine print thing there</font>

327
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,500
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier there is no such thing in</font>

329
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:26,350
a we actually substitute that with a

330
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,240
type 6500 what it says at the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

331
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,680
the slide so i'll give that example

<font color="#E5E5E5">again a little bit this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a conceptual</font>

337
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,600

totally application agnostic it can be

do that if you have some routes and some

it's that simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> once you look it up</font>

what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do with it well one thing</font>

369
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,410
you could do is say I got an

370
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,380
announcement I look it up to see if it's

371

valid or invalid if it's invalid maybe

372
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,070
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to do is alert the NOC say</font>

build and verify route filters on a say

nightly your weekly basis or whatever

378
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,550
your policy might be you could if you

379
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,979
wanted to although I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

380
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:17,079
would do this in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the short term actually</font>

00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,730
have control plane adjustments made in

dangerous<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to do right away I think</font>

384
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:24,279
personally this ought to be vetted out

385
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,779
for six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months to a year before anyone</font>

386
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,730
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's a very possible</font>

387
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:29,680
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and there's other tools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

can be built<font color="#E5E5E5"> so clearly because there's</font>

389
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,140
such a wide range in the upper half of

390
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:37,060
the hourglass starting with simple

391
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:39,730
verification just get an announcement go

392
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:43,420
look it up see it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right that's</font>

393
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,399
a great first<font color="#CCCCCC"> step to go with there is</font>

394
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,170
data available now this is what a real

395
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,000
zone file looks like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably in</font>

396
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:50,500
small print for the people in the back

397
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,870
of the room but you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

398
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,810
slides later this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual SRO</font>

record as a type sixty five four hundred

00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:01,899
and type 65 401 it actually shows how

401
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,220
the data is formatted and if you were to

402
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:04,870
do a dig right now you'd actually see

403
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,720
that this is for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> level threes</font>

data Centrelink also has data published

405
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,560
there I did some scans of various

bad however in this case quite a few 400

or so said I looked it up the data was

433
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,640
there and they were valid on the bottom

couple sub prefix hijacks that we tried

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,160
to inject using the techniques of

443
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,209
here's a real-time monitoring capability

444
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,490
that can build this map of the world and

<font color="#E5E5E5">show you where different announcements</font>

00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:49,280
data we found was valid or invalid and

448
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:50,930
so that's one method mechanism to start

449
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,420
using the verification side so you can

450

this or you can verify your own there's

452
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:59,210
nothing stopping you from writing a

think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real problem for us as</font>

508

operators is what protection is offered

00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:55,520
and what does it actually do in far as

510
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:57,920
far as trust and what I can specify and

511
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,060
what guy

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dynamic one I wanted already in my</font>

526
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:56,270
my problem with this approach is that I

00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:26,120
joke is proposing is to take the I are

00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:29,139
our data and drive that to cause the

536

fetches of the individual queries and

537
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:35,360
what that's doing is taking the Sal's

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have dynamic lookups which I've</font>

547
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,000

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,600
application yes knock notifications want

566
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:46,710

568
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:51,030
however we have done some experiments

569
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,120
where we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the offload</font>

box receive the information coming in do

00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,899
the bell do the lookup find out

572
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,820
something doesn't match and send a

573
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,130
competing route to a router to adjust

574
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,020
that so that by the within the timeout I

575
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,030
could it could make sure that it didn't

576
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,490
propagate that so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

577
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:10,170
real-time adjustments you can do so

578
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,670
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of things you can do</font>

579
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:15,680
Randy with this particular lightweight

580
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:19,010
technology enumeration is not necessary

581
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:22,890
this technology is not lightweight and

582
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:24,090
DNS SEC is not 20 years old well DNS is

583

20 years old and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:36,690
sorry which were fighting with every day

587
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:43,530
unfortunately sandy hi Sandy Murphy

588
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:47,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sparta I had two comments to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the distinction the differences between</font>

work that you're doing both<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

592
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,860

595
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:08,940
some important differences and I wanted

596
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:12,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk about two of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them okay the</font>

00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:17,080
semantics of the SRO and our lock record

00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:20,380
and the semantics of the ITF cider<font color="#CCCCCC"> roa</font>

00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,929
round origin attestation are subtly

00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,810
different yes they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are so in one</font>

601
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:30,540
particular slide you had something about

602
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:33,700
could interface to the RTR protocol I

603
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:37,240
presume without proof that you mean the

<font color="#CCCCCC">rpki to router protocol it's that has</font>

606
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:44,350
is something we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to try that's why I</font>

607
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:46,270
don't know I'm just I'm asking what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

608
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:50,139
art yes that's that's exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

609
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:53,020
meant ok so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RPG I to router protocol</font>

00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:54,910
extracts the prefix AS mapping from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">roads</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and sends it to the router and</font>

612
00:24:54,910 --> 00:25:03,490
there's a RAL aday shun algorithm

613
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:07,480
defined in RFC s that is in the router

614
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:11,730

00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:26,920
could not use that protocol to transmit

625
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,909
well be this is a proposal that we want

626
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,710
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at and we were told by some</font>

people<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco labs that this seemed</font>

628
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,650
like a reasonable approach that ought to

629
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,260
be tried out by having an external

630
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:55,600
validator do all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you very</font>

631
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:59,010
much next up we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris Tracy from es</font>

632
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,010
net talking about hundred gig

633
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:13,480
hello there now<font color="#E5E5E5"> for something completely</font>

634
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:15,590
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think where's the clicker</font>

635
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:19,580
that's right there yeah just a big green

636
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:22,070
button on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you hello good</font>

637
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:25,520
afternoon I'm Chris Tracy from from a

638
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:28,060
yes net<font color="#CCCCCC"> jes 293 going to be talking</font>

639
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:33,050
about 100 gig today and our experiences

640
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:34,280
so just a I have to apologize the title

641
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,620
of this talk might have been somewhat

642
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,110
miss named might have led you to believe

643
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,939
that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just experimenting with 100</font>

644
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,159
gig and it's actually definitely not the

645
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,020
case we're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing the middle</font>

646
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:48,470
deploying a production hundred gig

647
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,420
backbone across the nation so much of

648
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:52,850
this material and in our operational

649
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,710
experience was built on on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our initial</font>

650
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,870
experiences with deploying this coast to

coast prototype hundred gig network but

652
00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:00,350
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a few months this will all be</font>

653
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,600
transitioned to production production

00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:04,070
quality hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> cake network so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

655
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about a few things that we</font>

656
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,820
learned with our initial turn up but I

657
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to clear up any confusion</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a quick outline of the of attack I'm</font>

661
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,120
sure you're all capable of reading so

662
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,679
I'm just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on with it and</font>

663
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:26,449
start into a quick overview of what we

664
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:28,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">call a and I and andy s no five so a and</font>

665
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">I or the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced network initiative</font>

666
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:33,080
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a are funded program that was</font>

667
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:35,480
intended intended really to accelerate

668
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,310
the commercialization of hundred gig by

669
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,040
deploying a nationwide hundred kick back

670
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:42,379
home and so what we essentially have

671
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,510
today is a pre-production 100 gig

672
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,950
network that has hundreds 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig</font>

673
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,950
circuits stretching across the country

674
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:50,810
it links the three major department of

675
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,850
energy supercomputing centers shown here

676
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:55,399
in the the red circles those are nervous

677
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:57,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">gurgaon and oakridge and we also have</font>

exchange point known as man land in New

680
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:05,900
York so separate from the that we

681
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:08,419
basically another entirely dark

682
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,830
footprint which spans the nation this is

683
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:13,740
actually a separate fiber pair thats

684
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:15,629
it's mostly congruent to the the lit

685
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,850
the little work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about in</font>

686
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:19,650
a few moments you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know with the</font>

687
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:23,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">exception of some metro streams this</font>

688
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:24,390
this fiber is completely dark we're

689
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:27,510
actually actively looking for

690
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:29,400
researchers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and or vendors to to work</font>

691
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:33,390
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> us as submit proposals to use this</font>

692
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:35,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to field trials and approval</font>

693
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:37,770
technologies like like flexible<font color="#E5E5E5"> grid</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Road ohms and terabit lambdas things</font>

695
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:42,870
like that finally we have an

696
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:45,059
experimental test bed is deployed at

697
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,729
three locations at nerves are gone and

698
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:49,649
brookhaven this basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> consists of</font>

701
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:57,419

different types of research on networks

00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:10,649
even some some layer one optical gear

708
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:12,178
the primary purpose of this test fit is

709
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:15,030
really to facilitate network research

710
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:17,340
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like with the dark fiber footprint</font>

711
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:18,600
were we're actually actively supporting

712
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,309
a number of different funded research

713
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,120
projects who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually using this</font>

714
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:25,320
infrastructure to support their work and

715
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,389
finally it's also very<font color="#CCCCCC"> helpful for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

722
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,670
stay with me there's a you know

723
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:44,790
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big conference every year in</font>

724
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:45,809
November very much focused on

725
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-performance networking</font>

726
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:49,260
high-performance computing all the big

727
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,580
networking vendors are there all the big

728
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,129
you know high performance computing

729
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,809
vendors are there it's a big big

730
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,330
conference you know ten to fifteen

731
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:58,710
thousand people probably and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font>

732
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:01,050
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where there's always a big push</font>

733
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:03,679
to see you know how fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can make the</font>

734
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:06,500
network that year and so it the last

735
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,420
supercomputing in 2011 was in Seattle

736
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:12,270
what we essentially ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with at the</font>

737
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,950
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> was were 700 gig circuits one of</font>

738
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,120
which went all the way into seattle

739
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,690
talk a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the the</font>

740
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:22,928
engineering of that link at the end and

741
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:24,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">so we basically turned up seven seven</font>

742
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:26,500
hundred gig waves that are depicted here

743
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:28,449
in the map the smaller green dots are

744
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:31,269
showing the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> locations of the optical</font>

745
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:33,240
a drop points in this particular case

746
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:35,409
the small dots ended up being the

747
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,429
hundred gig regions in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of the</font>

748
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:40,480
longer circuits really that you know the

749
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:43,419
circuits terminate on the larger dots

750
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,940
which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> shown here so the larger dots</font>

751
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:47,679
are also optical a drop points but they

752
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,260
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> show where we deployed hundred</font>

753
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,730
dick routers at for this you know for to

754
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,429
build this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> network for</font>

755
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:56,169
supercomputing this is this is basically

756
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:58,149
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client handoff from the from</font>

757
00:30:56,169 --> 00:31:02,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the optical transport gear to the router</font>

758
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:04,510
occurred so so moving on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is just</font>

759
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:06,459
that was sort of a quick overview of A&I

760
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:09,000
and now where we're going with this is

761
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:11,289
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really to what we call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> es</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at five</font>

762
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,789
throughout that that whole roll out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

763
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:15,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the prototype network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I just discussed</font>

764
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:16,149
our intention has always been to

765
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,340
basically build something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font>

766
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:20,709
ultimately be transitioned to production

767
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:23,439
and inform the core<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our of our next</font>

768
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:25,299
generation<font color="#CCCCCC"> network so es net five is</font>

769
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,399
ultimately what what a and I will morph

770
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:29,408
into and and this will completely

771
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:31,629
supplant the current the current network

772
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:34,120
known as he isn't it for so this map is

773
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:36,549
just is showing the optical design is

774
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:40,268
this essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> consists of 13,000</font>

775
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:42,039
miles of lit fiber all of which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

776
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:45,519

777
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:48,490
manage the the wave capacity across the

network across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> black lines is</font>

779
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,210
actually shared with our with our

780
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:54,070
partner internet too so what we've done

781
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:57,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">is on these on these links we've divided</font>

782
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:58,870
the wave capacity and so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system</font>

783
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:01,720
is engineered<font color="#E5E5E5"> for fulfil so we we</font>

784
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:03,489
divided up to between<font color="#CCCCCC"> 88 channels</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

785
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:06,580
we get 40 for each at 50 gigahertz

786
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:09,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">spacing on some portions of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metro</font>

787
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:11,559
rings we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the it's actually solely</font>

788
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,740
owned by NESN so we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a full</font>

789
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:17,408
channel capacity to ourselves there so

790
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:20,110
as of today last I checked we were we

791
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:22,330
were over 200 amp nodes deployed across

792
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:25,209
this network there's still some work

793
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:27,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">that remains along along the west coast</font>

794
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:29,620
think it's Seattle<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to LA or so a</font>

795
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,539
lot of nodes are I think still in the

796
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:33,820
process of being brought up I think

797
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:36,820
we're anticipating about over 300 or

798
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,110
maybe 350 amp<font color="#CCCCCC"> no is it the when it when</font>

799
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:43,149
everything is finally finished being

800
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:45,039
built out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of out of all those nodes we</font>

801
00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:48,520
also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of a drop points just</font>

802
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,710
shown by the black circles and these are

803
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,779
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are essentially where we can add</font>

804
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:56,860
drop client signals and install

805
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:59,169
transponders and so these these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

806
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,330
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> mems-based</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multi degree</font>

807
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:03,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rotom that utilize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wavelength selectable</font>

808
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:05,529
switches and what they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is you</font>

809
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:07,330
know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can either all optically pass</font>

810
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:10,299
channels from one degree to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

811
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:12,760
they can they can do locally add they

812
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:15,250
can locally a drop channels and either

813
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:18,279
connect to clients or form regions for

814
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:21,250
four long circuits and 15 of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes</font>

815
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:22,419
particularly in the metro metro areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

816
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,940
have what we call directionless

817
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:26,919
capabilities by directionless we really

818
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:29,289
mean that waves determinate on that node

819
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:31,450
can actually be optically rerouted

820
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:33,610
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> either east or west without</font>

821
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:35,500
physically moving any fiber at the at

822
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:38,590
that sign so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is particularly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> useful</font>

823
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,940
in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> metro areas where we know we might</font>

824
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,949
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually rear out circuits in</font>

825
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,480
the event of fiber cuts since we're

826
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:47,230
provisioning all these circuits without

827
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,299
any kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of protection so we're getting</font>

828
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:52,210
close to working our way here up to up

829
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:54,700
to layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font>

830
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:58,149
you'll actually see how all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2300</font>

831
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,740
circuits and you know see where they're

832
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:01,719
all actually landing at and where all

833
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,370
the routers are deployed so but shown

834
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,020
here are just two examples of hundred

835
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:07,928
gig circuits across the wide area as

836
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:09,940
well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a metro the circuits are handed</font>

837
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:12,668
off 100 gig routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're deployed at</font>

838
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,200
the endpoints of these circuits and if

839
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:17,109
the circuit extends quite far like that

840
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:20,469
one from Sacramento to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

841
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:22,598
Denver it was usually one or more

842
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:23,830
regions required along you know

843
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:26,560
somewhere in the middle to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensure an</font>

844
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:29,369
error-free link and so currently we're

845
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:33,929
targeting 23<font color="#CCCCCC"> lambdas to turn up by</font>

846
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:36,480
by the early fall this year so in total

847
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:38,009
you know to support all those 23

848
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,529
circuits we we obviously need to have

849
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:42,179
transponders were determining but you

850
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:44,730
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> for many of these we also required</font>

links over like you know 1,800

911

kilometers this does increase the bit

912

rate for that single wavelength up to

00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:27,140
about 112 gigabit range due to that

925
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,040
a little bit about what what exactly

00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:00,500
that is in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past you know in order to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">from 1 to 10 was simply a matter of just</font>

just binary intensity modulation we

00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:11,329
could go from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 to 10 with a single</font>

932
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:14,119

933
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:16,160
particularly fancy the commercial

934
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:18,170
success of 10 gig has really led to

935
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,569
quite a cost reduction of all these 10

936
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,339
gigabyte components so instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

937
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:24,410
changing the symbol rate drastically

938
00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred gig has really looked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into two</font>

939
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:29,690
other ways of leveraging the existing

940
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:32,569
technology and trying to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ways</font>

941
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:34,490
to to increase the channel bitrate so

942
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:36,829
dual polarization was one way to achieve

943
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:39,290
this you can take polarization

944
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:41,119
multiplexers and and basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> double</font>

945
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,910
the channel great channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> bitrate by by</font>

946
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,829
just simply combining two orthogonal

947
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:47,240
polarizations so this this actually

948
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:48,760
doesn't change the amount of optical

949
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,259
spectrum that's needed

950
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,300
that's actually used on the fiber but it

951
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,250
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> allows you to double the channel</font>

952
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,070
bitrate so the graphic here that's

953
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,240
highlighted in the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> red box is</font>

954
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:00,320
intended to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help kind of visualize this</font>

955
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,569
concept it shows how there's a

956
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,510
horizontal on a vertical polarization

957
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:07,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are multiplexing to one signal and</font>

958
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:11,300
so in addition to keep costs low you can

959
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:13,940
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a single laser and have to mod</font>

960
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,650
you laterz to drive a cost down for so

961
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:18,800
you use the same transmitter for both

962
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:20,030
polarizations and so this this technique

963
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,950
turns out to work with or without

964
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:24,170
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called coherent detection that</font>

965
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:26,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about in a</font>

966
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:27,200
couple slides but it turns out coherent

967
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:31,520
detection is really a most

968
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,529
cost-effective way to do this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving</font>

969
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,230
on to the the modulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheme the the</font>

970
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:38,390
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> technique that's used to increase</font>

971
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:40,640
increase the channel bitrate and avoid

972
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:44,000
increasing the symbol rate is to use

973
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,589
this fancy modulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheme instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

974
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,480
using something like on-off keying we're

975
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:48,799
returning the laser on and off we're

976
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,140
basically changing the phase of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

977
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,570
signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the optical carrier to encode</font>

978
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,819
the data so in other words phase shift

979
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:57,380
keying quadrature phase-shift keying

980
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,150
just just means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're using for</font>

981
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:01,790
optical phases with each phase

982
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:03,890
representing two bids so this this red

box kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sort of depicts the in this</font>

really reduced the required speed<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

cost from that popularity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 10 gig that</font>

997
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:39,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was talking about so from so here's an</font>

998
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:41,240
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this looks like from a</font>

999
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,700
from a spectrum perspective in the

1000
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:45,830
middle there's a hundred gig signal this

1001
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">is basically two carriers space 20</font>

1002
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:51,200

1003
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:53,480
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about 14 big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abad so what we</font>

1004
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,129
basically have here are two carriers we

1005
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,930
have two polarizations and we have two

1006
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:58,369
bits per symbol

1007
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:00,379
from those constellation diagrams we

1008
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:02,960
just looked at so what we end up with

1009
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:05,359
these these 214 big<font color="#CCCCCC"> abad carrier is</font>

1010
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,300
turning into 112 gigabit per second

1011
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:10,190
signal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just pop up the the</font>

1012
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,329
channel spacing here and you can you can

1013
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:14,660
see this quiet this fits quite nicely

1014
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:16,010
into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 gigahertz spectrum the other</font>

1015
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,290
thing that's clear here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

1016
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:20,510
spectral efficiency of these hundred gig

1017
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:22,400
signals is quite a bit better there's

1018
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:23,960
there's actually less wasted spectrum

1019
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,700
you can kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see when you compared to</font>

1020
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,520
the to the 10 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 40 gig signal</font>

1021
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:33,589
you're using more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's available</font>

1022
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:35,450
there in that 50 gigahertz band right so

1023
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:36,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">I briefly mentioned coherent detection a</font>

1024
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,629
few slides back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm going to</font>

1025
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:40,280
elaborate a little bit more on that this

1026
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,190
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really the breakthrough</font>

1027
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,380
technology that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did at least in my</font>

1028
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:47,089
opinion is changing everything this was

1029
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:50,569
originally<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed back in the 70s or</font>

1030
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:51,828
80s and but really optical amps proved

1031
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:54,619
to be a cheaper and easier way to

1032
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:56,660
improve the noise tolerance so so a lot

1033
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:59,000
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on coherent was was largely</font>

1034
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:01,098
abandoned you know we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> placing</font>

1035
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">amps every 50 to 100 kilometers and</font>

1036
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:05,270
problems or basically solved and we

1037
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,890
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to worry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this so the</font>

1038
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:09,410
coherent detection has been sort of

1039
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:11,540
rejuvenated due to the all the advances

1040
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:13,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">in digital signal processing the number</font>

1041
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:16,520
of gates operating frequencies have all

1042
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:18,500
changed so now we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually process</font>

1043
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,299
these these kinds of signals and apply

1044
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,880
these sophisticated transformations in

1045
00:42:20,299 --> 00:42:25,910
order to do this signal recovery you

1046
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,160
know two things like hundred gig and

1047
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:30,828
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the there are two things that</font>

1048
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,480
this is is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing it's really</font>

1049
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:35,240
leading to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> elimination of needing</font>

1050
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,040
dispersion compensating fiber chromatic

1051
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,169
dispersion is just simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> no longer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1052
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,839
limiting factor like it has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 10</font>

1053
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:43,520
gig and the other neat thing about

1054
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,980
coherent detection is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it really</font>

1055
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,049
works like a radio receiver you know you

1056
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:50,359
you basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> tune a local oscillator to</font>

1057
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:53,480
the frequency<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in so</font>

1058
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:55,069
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's frequency selective this is</font>

1059
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,460
proved to be quite a breakthrough in

1060
00:42:55,069 --> 00:43:00,020
optical filtering because so far optical

1061
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,319
filter technology has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been very</font>

1062
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">disappointing it's never really been</font>

1063
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,440
matured to the point where it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost</font>

1064
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">effective so things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> colourless</font>

1065
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rotom architectures have never</font>

1066
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:12,369
really gotten very far because the

1067
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,720
optical filtering technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just as</font>

1068
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:16,840
you have just<font color="#E5E5E5"> never matured to the point</font>

1069
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,520
where it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost-effective to do this and</font>

1070
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,830
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> colourless wrote them you know</font>

1071
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:23,200
our architectures are now being created

1072
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:25,480
now that this technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> is here and</font>

1073
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,299
becoming reality so we will finally

1074
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,010
really have the you know the complete

1075
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,750
software reprogram ability of the

1076
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:33,880
optical layer using coherent detection

1077
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:35,800
so you once you bring this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing up</font>

1078
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,619
you're not going to have to move fibers

1079
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,760
around in order to you know if you tuned

1080
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:41,170
to a different wavelength you're just

1081
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,980
going to automatically be able to shoot

1082
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:46,420
that wave on to wherever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to go</font>

1083
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:48,700
there's a few interesting side effects

1084
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:51,100
of this one of them is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know</font>

1085
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:53,710
really we no longer really need fixed

1086
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:55,540
optical filters components such as the

1087
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:58,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">reed waveguide ratings that are very</font>

1088
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:59,710
common in DWDM systems would basically

1089
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:01,029
be pulled out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> replaced with</font>

1090
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:02,950
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of components</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

1091
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:05,380
essentially just splitters and combiners

1092
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:07,240
and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and if we</font>

1093
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,460
no longer have a need for for fixed

1094
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:12,189
optical filters we don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a</font>

1095
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,170
fixed wavelength grid and so we really

1096
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:17,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need to actually stay aligned to</font>

1097
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:19,119
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITU grid and longer and ultimately</font>

1098
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:21,100
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make more</font>

1099
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,960
efficient use of the spectrum will be

00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:25,060

1102
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,700
you'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pack them closer and</font>

1103
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,130
give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount of band what they</font>

1107
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:41,200
this concept but but I think in time

1108
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:42,520
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see this so one</font>

1109
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,859
interesting thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is that has come</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">has become a really important issue it's</font>

1112
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:52,000
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just if you want to go above</font>

1113
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:54,189
100 gig to 400 cake or one terabit but

1114
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,900
but even just staying at 100 gig we're

1115
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:57,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to see the effects of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vamp</font>

1119

00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:41,190
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to have so this has had</font>

1135
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:43,320
some very real impacts on the advertised

1136
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:45,420
reach for example of the of our hundred

1137
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,760
gig long-haul components and has you

1138
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,530
know essentially driven us to need more

1139
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,220
regions than you know you initially

1140
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:54,720
think you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need so just</font>

1141
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,689
getting back to the the flexible grid

1142
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,029
idea just for one moment if you want to

1143
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:01,950
go up beyond 100 gig at some point we're

1144
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:03,900
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit a limit where we're going</font>

1145
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:05,549
to require a better and better signor

1146
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,829
noise ratio which at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some point is just</font>

1147
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:10,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just not going to be achievable and</font>

1148
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:12,660
so you know one<font color="#CCCCCC"> way is to go about we</font>

1149
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,759
could put ultra low loss fiber all in

1150
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:18,240
the ground everywhere which is probably

1151
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,349
not a very very viable option you know

1152
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,560
we're probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be stuck with</font>

1153
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:23,460
the fiber we have for for quite a while

1154
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,930
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons why</font>

1155
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,849
flexible grid could be very beneficial

1156
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:28,560
because we can we can simply throw more

1157
00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:31,020
spectrum at the problem and not have to

1158
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,910
worry as<font color="#CCCCCC"> much about the OSN are so you</font>

1159
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:34,410
can see what's being depicted here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1160
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:37,200
you know your your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred gig channels</font>

1161
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:38,879
and are<font color="#E5E5E5"> using maybe you know a certain</font>

1162
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,069
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of spectrum but you know once you</font>

1163
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,250
get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a terabit waves you might give</font>

1164
00:46:41,069 --> 00:46:45,450
those a 150 gigahertz a spectrum and you

1165
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,099
know you would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would require</font>

1166
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:49,529
again all the Waveland selectable switch

1167
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:51,780
components to support all this but this

1168
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:59,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">is something that you know it looks like</font>

1169
00:46:51,780 --> 00:47:02,099
it's it's likely to happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay my</font>

1170
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:05,849
clicker is not working pareil<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1171
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:08,760
that's kind of it's kind of a rundown on

1172
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:11,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">the 100 gig over the over the win and</font>

1173
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:14,880
just moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a bit about 100 gig</font>

1174
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:16,560
Ethernet transmission this is a through

1175
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,740
this diagram here because I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

1176
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,119
it depicted how the packetization and

1177
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:23,549
you know works with hundred gig Ethernet

1178
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,099
because it's quite a bit different they

1179
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:29,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">really had to they really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had to exploit</font>

1180
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:31,010
parallelism throughout the design and

1181
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:34,190
you see here we know the

1182
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:36,260
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical coding sublayer is really</font>

1183
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:39,040
doing some sonnet like functions where

1184
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:41,990
you know it's providing the ability to

1185
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:45,440
to give the r you know to avoid

1186
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:47,839
reordering and skew<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the way buns so</font>

1187
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,530
it's adding very synchronous kinds of

1188
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:54,530
concepts to ethernet to allow basically

1189
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:56,480
allow you to use 10 gigabit components

1190
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:58,670
and turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> things into smaller and smaller</font>

1191
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,250
signals and reorder them all 18 when

1192
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:03,620
they come in on the receiver so and then

1193
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:06,080
here's a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> closer look at what</font>

1194
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:08,359
what the inside of for example 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> gig</font>

1195
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:11,690
cfp looks like right and you have this

1196
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:13,190
thing you have the physical medium

1197
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:14,600
attachment and then the important thing

1198
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:17,660
here is this thing called the gearbox

1199
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:19,040
the 10 to 40 year box this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see in the</font>

1203
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:31,520
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> gearbox that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can be quite a caustic</font>

1204
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:33,050
component and finally you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this is</font>

1205
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,310
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> showing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you how the four</font>

1207
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:38,029
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this possibility of skew and</font>

1208
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,530
wavelengths and these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and things associated with them and</font>

1213
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:48,110
that's what all those sonnet like

1214
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,850
features that you saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the last slide</font>

1215
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:51,560
or you know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you the</font>

1216
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:53,390
ability to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these these</font>

1217
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:57,980
physical effects of what happens after

1218
00:48:53,390 --> 00:49:01,400
these these signals go down the fiber so

1219
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:03,110
on to plug holes you know at one point

1220
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,410
in our deployment we were faced with the

1221
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:09,830
decision of do we do we go with lr 4s or

1222
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:12,549
what's called ten by ten ten by ten are

1223
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:16,880
gaining popularity and in vendor support

1224
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:18,080
you know we've we were unsure if this

1225
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,760
was actually going to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> out for us</font>

1226
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,350
but what we eventually decided to go

1227
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,080
with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ten by ten here that I</font>

1228
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:25,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">have highlighted in the middle I'm sure</font>

1229
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,500
you can probably guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the major</font>

1230
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:29,650
factors<font color="#E5E5E5"> where there was the two dollar</font>

1231
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:33,050
signs compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three dollar signs</font>

1232
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:35,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so this this was a very very</font>

1233
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:37,550
significant you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know amount of money</font>

1234
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:41,840
when when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start multiplying things</font>

1235
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:43,030
by by 52 or so or even you know 104

1236
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,760
since you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need optics on</font>

1237
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:47,560
transponders and on the routers right so

1238
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,140
so this ended up being a non-trivial

1239
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:52,210
cost for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and we ended up deciding to</font>

1240
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:54,069
go with these these<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten by ten optics</font>

1241
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:56,320
even though they were they were not an i

1242
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:58,930
triple e standard they had they had

1243
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:01,270
significant industry support and we were

1244
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:02,259
able to to work with our vendors to you

1245
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:04,900
know make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these were going to</font>

1246
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:08,080
work you know so one of the things that

1247
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:10,480
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I elaborate on this a bit more</font>

1248
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:13,000
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing</font>

1249
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">with 10 gig in one gig pluggable zor any</font>

1250
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,910

1251
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:17,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you already have you know will it work</font>

1252
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:19,359
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean some vendors are going to</font>

1253
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:20,560
lock it down and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be</font>

1254
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,580
able to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all and they're going</font>

1255
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,670
to you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1256
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:26,440
force you to buy their certified optics

1257
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:28,120
and some vendors will you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll</font>

1258
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,310
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it might not be very happy and</font>

1259
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,839
so it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same kinds of same kinds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1260
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:36,970
issues we've seen with with one gig and

1261
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:39,520
10 gig right so in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of optical</font>

1262
00:50:36,970 --> 00:50:42,040
power these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really hot they</font>

1263
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:44,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">launch it like you know plus 13</font>

1264
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:46,540
aggregate so you know one of the things

1265
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:48,550
we found interesting is you know we

1266
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,110
sometimes didn't even have power meters

1267
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:51,700
that could they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> read that high</font>

1268
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:53,680
right i mean the you plug the thing in

1269
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,960
it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as high right it just has no I</font>

1270
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:59,200
you know the power meter only goes to

00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:01,330
plus<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example and I guess some of</font>

1272
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,939
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we realized after</font>

1273
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:05,470
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to look at these were that</font>

1274
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:07,240
you know you really can't test for

1275
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:09,730
compliance unless you have an optical

1276
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,560
spectrum analyzer if you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1277
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">see the per Lane optical power across</font>

1278
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,980
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 wavelengths the tall 10</font>

1279
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,470
wavelengths that this thing is putting

1280
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:19,210
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fiber you really can't you know</font>

1281
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:20,500
see what you know how much difference

1282
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:23,800
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is between the wave runs for</font>

1283
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:25,360
example or or if you have one cfp that's

1284
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,730
a little bit better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the other right</font>

1285
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,710
because you might have a out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a pile</font>

1286
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:30,880
of cfp some might launch hotter on

1287
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:32,080
average and you might actually get a

1288
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,970
little bit better performance out of

1289
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:37,779
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are actually launching a</font>

1290
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:39,399
little hotter for example and just a few

1291
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:42,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">other things that we've just sort of</font>

1292
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:44,290
random notes here we've generally found

1293
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,480
that with the 10 by tens we just like

1294
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:47,980
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug them in you know they engineer</font>

1295
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,630
them nicely to be able to you know not

1296
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:52,470
need any attenuators when you when you

1297
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:54,940
plug them in<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font>

1298
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:57,759
sr10 we really haven't had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole lot</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of experience with so we're you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1300
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,740
still looking at maybe using this in

1301
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:04,540
some locations for hooking up hosts

1302
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:07,509
eventually or something like that but

1303
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've really standardized on on 10 by 10</font>

1304
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:13,720
or also known as el are<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 and you know</font>

1305
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,940
that that's sort of really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

1306
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,160
pluggable we've really done any thorough

1307
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,110
testing out we've done some lr fours and

1308
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,589
some limited cases but it's really

1309
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:26,230
mostly 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> by 10 C XPS look very</font>

1310
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:28,090
interesting you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they claim to be</font>

1311
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:30,640
there going to be interoperable with

1312
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:32,530
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> CFPs in terms of you know you can</font>

1313
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,060
plug<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fiber into a cxp over here and</font>

1314
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:35,830
you can plug a fiber the other end of it

1315
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:39,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">into a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cfp and everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should work</font>

1316
00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:45,120
fine we have you know really have no

1317
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:47,350
experience with<font color="#CCCCCC"> C XPS yet but so anyway</font>

1318
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:49,120
we're turning up our first hundred gig

1319
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:50,830
circuit in October of last year right

1320
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,660
and this is a this is a month before the

1321
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:55,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">big conference where we have to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1322
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:57,370
the hundred gig stuff working and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you</font>

1323
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,320
know things are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are great we can</font>

1324
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:01,089
hang across this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> our first hundred</font>

1325
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:03,670
gig<font color="#CCCCCC"> Channel right that's going almost</font>

1326
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:06,820
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole country which is very</font>

1327
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:08,290
cool we have about<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty days or so and</font>

1328
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know we actually do want to actually</font>

1329
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:12,700
allow users to test this stuff before

1330
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:15,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">before we you know before we actually</font>

1331
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:17,259
have the show and it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great to</font>

1332
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:19,029
be able to ping but we really wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1333
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:21,970
you know show that under load this thing

1334
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:23,830
still performed well everything looked

1335
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:26,169
perfectly fine for the transport system

1336
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:27,880
you know effect was not like you know

1337
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:29,980
kicking in at all it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know</font>

1338
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:32,080
showing showing everything looking very

1339
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:33,520
clean but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just drive it at</font>

1340
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,380
one hundred percent utilization just to

1341
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,960
really make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything was was okay</font>

1342
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:41,050
and and and really measure<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero drops do</font>

1343
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:43,030
some some validation of of qos and

1344
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:44,440
things like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the question</font>

1345
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:45,490
became well well how are we<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

1346
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,560
are we going to test this because we

1347
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:49,509
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any hundred test sets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

1348
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:52,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're how are we going to generate</font>

1349
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:55,720
this much traffic right and do we do we

1350
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:57,760
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy a hundred big test box so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1351
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:00,009
have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> these 10 gigabit per testers</font>

1352
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,080
already deployed everywhere just

1353
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:04,210
basically hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have 10 gig Nick's</font>

1354
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,720
in them and so we decided well let's

1355
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:08,750
have some fun with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some routing loop</font>

1356
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,910
so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a you know a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> persona our</font>

1357
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:12,470
boxes what you know is that what the

1358
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:15,200
boxes are called that have these 10 gig

1359
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:17,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">Knicks to our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> existing routers on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> es net</font>

1360
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:20,060
for we hooked up a couple 10 gigs

1361
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:22,960
between es net for and an ani which will

1362
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:25,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">be es 95 soon and we started basically</font>

1363
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,260
creating some you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically just</font>

1364
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:29,090
throwing in some static routes and and

1365
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:32,420
started starting making routing loops

1366
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:34,070
and we carefully chose some TTL so the

1367
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:36,440
traffic would loop exactly the right a

1368
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:38,150
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times and and and voila we</font>

1369
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,700
just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn on an i pref</font>

1370
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:43,099
cannon and instantly we have traffic

1371
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:45,020
looping 50 times around around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1372
00:54:43,099 --> 00:54:46,460
network and we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually see the the</font>

1373
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:49,490
utilization go all the way up to hundred

1374
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:51,859
percent so this was this this gave us

1375
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:53,209
some you know good feedback that okay

1376
00:54:51,859 --> 00:54:54,770
this is you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not getting any</font>

1377
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:57,020
errors on the routers the transport

1378
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:59,960
system still looks good you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

1379
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:01,670
pretty happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this so that was that</font>

1380
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,500
was a quick way to just saturate the

1381
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:05,060
link and just do some sanity checks and

1382
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,900
we're really wondering can we can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1383
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,849
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more</font>

1384
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,560
sophisticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually start</font>

1385
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:11,930
counting packets and making sure we're

1386
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">really not losing any so we started</font>

1387
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:15,770
actually setting up policy-based routes

1388
00:55:13,609 --> 00:55:17,299
for policy based routing to do more

1389
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:20,270
complex loops we're still doing

1390
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:21,410
basically sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> just UDP traffic but</font>

1391
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:23,330
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the routers and</font>

1392
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:25,009
essentially sticking in these these

1393
00:55:23,330 --> 00:55:27,259
policy based routing configs and

1394
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:29,510
firewall<font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles to to start counting</font>

1395
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:32,270
back packets and and measure loss and

1396
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:34,250
everything and and and this just whoops

1397
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:36,740
right this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> just worked out great</font>

1398
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:38,330
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean we we fired this off and</font>

1399
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:40,580
we were we were looping stuff around the

1400
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:43,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">entire the entire network all across all</font>

1401
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:46,700
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> 700 gig channels that we brought</font>

1402
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,140
up and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you know zero loss so</font>

1403
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:50,270
that was that was really what we were

1404
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:51,560
looking for and we're very very happy to

1405
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:53,330
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then we you know go and</font>

1406
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:57,349
hand it off to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who actually</font>

1407
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:59,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so so that was that the</font>

1408
00:55:57,349 --> 00:56:01,099
next step<font color="#CCCCCC"> was really to see well you</font>

1409
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,599
know how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP perform on this thing</font>

1410
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:04,040
right because this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are totally</font>

1411
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:07,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">different totally different gear that</font>

1412
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:10,160
we've not used to what we essentially

1413
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:11,480
ended up configuring here<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's unless</font>

1414
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,060
you're familiar with this is might be a

1415
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,500
little hard to see nurse gives on the

1416
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:18,049
west coast

1417
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:20,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oakland California argon is in is near</font>

1418
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:23,150
Chicago in the middle there are

1419
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:26,990
basically are 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> gig links between</font>

1420
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:28,820
chicago and california and what we what

1421
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:30,560
we had at each site is part of that

1422
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:32,750
experimental test bed on a and I that I

1423
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:34,220
told<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about we had a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts</font>

1424
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:36,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are actually capable of each</font>

1425
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:38,089
sourcing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sinking 40 kick of traffic</font>

1426
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:40,730
each so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have the ability to actually</font>

1427
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:43,910
generate a 120 gig of traffic and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sync</font>

1428
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:45,740
120 gig at either end so we started

1429
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:48,500
basically configuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some vpls</font>

1430
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:50,660
instances here and and basically firing

1431
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:53,960
this stuff up and here you can basically

1432
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:56,210
see that out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 streams we were able</font>

1433
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,890
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get basically 9.9 gig on on each</font>

1434
00:56:56,210 --> 00:57:00,230
stream the last couple were actually a

1435
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:01,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">little lower 9.4 those those hosts are</font>

1436
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:03,080
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was just slightly different</font>

1437
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:05,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">hardware rather</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't couldn't quite</font>

1438
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:07,009
do as well and at the very bottom air on

1439
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:09,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the router you could actually see</font>

1440
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:11,450
the the percentage utilization on the

1441
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:14,029
under gig interface was actually

1442
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:15,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety-nine percent so this was this</font>

1443
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">gave us you know a good confidence that</font>

1444
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:20,450
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP was going to perform as well</font>

1445
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:23,690
well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> also which you know we had a lot</font>

1446
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:25,310
of concerns about<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did still find some</font>

1447
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:29,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">issues with this but I'll get into that</font>

1448
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:30,980
in a bit so at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point we we had sort</font>

1449
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:33,109
of learned a little bit about well you

1450
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:35,630
know there were some certain things that

1451
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:37,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">were good about using host-based testers</font>

1452
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:39,020
and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually had access access</font>

1453
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:41,390
to some hardware testers as well and

1454
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:44,020
that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> proved to be very valuable</font>

1455
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:46,819
because there they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good at it</font>

1456
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:50,090
precisely controlling the packet content

1457
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:51,170
they're very stable well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if</font>

1458
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:54,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">I should say that actually they're not</font>

1459
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:55,780
not only stable but you can test you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1460
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:58,310
test<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> including</font>

1461
00:57:55,780 --> 00:58:00,380
things like reordering which can be

1462
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:03,080
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to actually test with</font>

1463
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:03,920
with host-based testers i'm so i'm not

1464
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,569
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read everything on this table</font>

1465
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,770
but there you know we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

1466
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:08,840
started writing down some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1467
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:11,240
advantages<font color="#E5E5E5"> and disadvantages of hardware</font>

1468
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:14,390
testers and and the host based testers I

1469
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,919
they both were very useful and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font>

1470
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:18,170
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> their advantages and disadvantages</font>

1471
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,790
so you know we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the host based</font>

1472
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:21,560
testers it was very nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually be</font>

1473
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:23,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to fire up a real applications and</font>

1474
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,040
start doing you know just to disk

1475
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:25,840
transfers and see how stuff is really

1476
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:31,600
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with</font>

1477
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:34,330
hook up real host to this thing so so

1478
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,740
moving on you know the this you know I

1479
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:37,180
make this all sound like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if everything</font>

1480
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:38,950
was just great and definitely never had

1481
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,470
any problems but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know obviously</font>

1482
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:43,270
obviously we did and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we found</font>

1483
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:46,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">ourselves basically tracking down lost</font>

1484
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:47,530
problems tracking down reordering and

1485
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:49,930
things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

1486
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:52,480
out what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on we were we were</font>

1487
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:54,549
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know acting alone we were</font>

1488
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,560
actually had you know customers who had

1489
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:59,440
routers that are other vendors right and

1490
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:01,090
connecting to us and connecting to other

1491
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,280
networks is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're using different gear</font>

1492
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:04,420
right so we're sort of connecting a

1493
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,010
whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hundred gig stuff</font>

1494
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:08,680
together that's all basically brand new

1495
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:10,540
lots of different vendors you know

1496
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,299
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we had some issues here and</font>

1497
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:15,400
there and and we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

1498
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,960
tracking down losses is pretty easy as

1499
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,580
long as you have accurate counters and

1500
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,740
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's nice to be able to</font>

1501
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:22,840
actually filter on a like an IP address

1502
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:24,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">or something and be able to to track</font>

1503
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:27,070
down loss that way by counting packets

1504
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:29,710
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when you have background</font>

1505
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:31,840
traffic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that or you can't</font>

1506
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:33,700
count with<font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles it can be it can be</font>

1507
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:35,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite difficult to see if you know if I</font>

1508
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:38,410
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I getting lost here or nowhere is</font>

1509
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:40,600
this loss coming from you know it's very

1510
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:42,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">important obviously to know where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

1511
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:46,240
the drop counters are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your boxes I</font>

1512
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:48,190
mean you know is it getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> dropped you</font>

1513
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:49,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">know in some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Q somewhere or you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1514
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:52,330
where where<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this where is this loss</font>

1515
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:54,100
happening that I'm seeing so you know we

1516
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:57,040
spent a quite a good bit of time

1517
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:59,380
tweaking qos and and all this to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1518
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:02,020
you know figure out how to get this all

1519
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:04,420
running loss free tracking down

1520
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:05,770
reordering was quite difficult you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1521
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:07,870
especially if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a hardware</font>

1522
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:10,660
tester we found some ways to do this

1523
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:13,870
using host but we really like to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1524
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:15,730
the hardware testers for this you know

1525
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:18,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've we were we were doing things like</font>

1526
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:19,840
capturing packet traces and you know all

1527
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:21,520
kinds of stuff and analyzing these

1528
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,590
things and kind of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure this</font>

1529
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:27,100
out so it was it turned out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be you</font>

1530
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:29,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">know quite time consuming to do so loop</font>

1531
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:32,020
backs intended you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure many</font>

1532
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:34,810
people have you know

1533
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:36,310
obviously you learn the values of using

1534
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:39,190
loop backs are debugging things like

1535
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:40,930
sonnet circuits and you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found</font>

1536
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:42,880
that it was very helpful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to</font>

1537
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:44,500
to verify patching and things like that

1538
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,180
by going on to our transport gear

1539
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:48,370
setting a facility loop facing the

1540
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:49,960
router making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had linked come up</font>

1541
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:51,940
on a port you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could we could</font>

1542
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:54,040
quickly sanity check patching between

1543
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:56,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">between the optical transport layer and</font>

1544
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:59,020
the routers that way so so that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1545
01:00:56,620 --> 01:01:00,700
helpful you could ping you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

1546
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:02,560
basically send pings to a broadcast

1547
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:05,140

01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:07,990
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it was just very helpful</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to place loops in different</font>

had to work out but<font color="#CCCCCC"> eventually we got</font>

this all all working quite well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1558
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:30,550
a few notes on interoperability before

1559
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:33,819
we get to the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> here between between</font>

01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:35,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the transport gear and the you know the</font>

01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:37,330
layer 2 and in the optical transport

1562
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:39,670
year we really didn't see any issues i

1563
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:41,830
mean the optical transport gear was just

1564
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:43,420
you know bits went in bits came out it

1571

1572
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:02,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">know various different kinds of issues</font>

1573
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:03,790
remember it's you know 100 gigs still

1574
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:05,620
find new we're dealing with with you

1575
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:08,080
know products that are you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">help the door vendors have chosen</font>

1577
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:12,220
slightly different ways of dealing with

1578
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:14,200
100 gig and supporting hundred gig in

1579
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:17,080
their platform so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it's really</font>

1580
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:19,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">important to understand exactly how how</font>

1581
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:21,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">how the flows go through your equipment</font>

1582
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:23,620
I mean you know what is the interface on

1583
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:25,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back side of your 100 gig line card</font>

1584
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:26,950
you know how does it interface to the

1585
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,960
backplane how does that backplane

1586
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:31,000
interface to the switch fabric you know

1587
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,790
or they can they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually handle a</font>

1588
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:36,070
single hundred gig flow or that you know

1589
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:38,620
doing something different and an

1590
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:40,120
understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know understanding</font>

1591
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:42,310
what schemes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use to basically</font>

1592
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,060
internally load balance or something

1593
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:44,350
like that is

1594
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:46,390
it can all be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important in</font>

1595
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:50,290
understanding how you how to get good

1596
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:51,790
performance so you know we basically

1597
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:53,980
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not all the vendors</font>

1598
01:02:51,790 --> 01:02:57,580
were we're necessarily optimizing for

1599
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:58,960
for one single line rate flow and and so

1600
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:00,610
this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely loves us some</font>

1601
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:04,390
challenges<font color="#CCCCCC"> that took</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some time to work</font>

1602
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:06,610
out so with the with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten by ten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cfps</font>

1603
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:08,680
we we certainly had<font color="#CCCCCC"> some concerns with</font>

1604
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:10,840
interoperability you know we there were

1605
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,669
we certainly went into this is a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1606
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:14,200
an unknown as to whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you know</font>

1607
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:15,970
this thing was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

1608
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:19,120
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten and is it going to talk okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1609
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:21,220
this other thing after after<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

1610
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:23,759
testing through supercomputing and after

1611
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:26,200
we basically ended up demonstrating

1612
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:28,360
basic interoperability and by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1613
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,859
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just mean these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things could</font>

1614
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:31,450
pass packets they weren't always really

1615
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:34,240
happy that you stuck this this this

1616
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:35,919
piece of this pluggable in there but you

1617
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">know things did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know package did</font>

1618
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,880
flow and you know i'm not going to claim

1619
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:43,600
that your vendor is going to officially

1620
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:46,330
support this they probably won't but but

1621
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:47,950
overall you know we we found that you

1622
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:50,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">know in general</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we could just plug these</font>

1623
01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:52,149
things in and they work quite well the

1624
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:54,009
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> for optical power monitoring you</font>

1625
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:56,710
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the CLI is varied quite a bit i</font>

1626
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:59,350
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some had it some didn't some</font>

1627
01:03:56,710 --> 01:04:01,510
had perlane power some had only only

1628
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:04,930
aggregate power some had not you know

1629
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:07,000
nothing and also so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1630
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:08,799
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit you know a little disappointing</font>

1631
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,890
but you know not not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big</font>

1632
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:13,990
surprise and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortunately over over short</font>

1633
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:16,120
distances we had no problems plugging in

1634
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:17,830
the the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> kilometer versions of the 10</font>

1635
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:20,470
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 into 10 kilometer versions of the</font>

1636
01:04:17,830 --> 01:04:26,319
10 by 10 so that was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> good to good</font>

1637
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:28,390
to find out and so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of a</font>

1638
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:30,010
this is sort of a some details about

1639
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:31,990
what we what we did with those hundred

1640
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:34,150
gigs that we took up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to supercomputing</font>

1641
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:36,279
so in near<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning i mentioned we</font>

1642
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:38,650
had 100 gig from from Salt Lake going up

1643
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:41,770
to seattle and so one of the challenges

1644
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:44,500
here was that another another network

1645
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:47,440
canary in in canada actually wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1646
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:49,780
bring 100 feet channel in as well so we

1647
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:52,180
basically you know had to work very

1648
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:53,620
closely with the sign it wide area

1649
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:55,230
network group to figure out how are we

1650
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:56,759
going to do this and so

1651
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:59,400
what we ended<font color="#CCCCCC"> up here with is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

1652
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:01,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actual OE o conversion</font>

1653
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:04,650
really happened right on the show floor

1654
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:07,379
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade show and down in salt lake</font>

1655
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:09,240
city for for our circuit in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle</font>

1656
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">here we had a couple of regions so there</font>

1657
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:14,368
were actually two regions required

1658
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:16,010
between salt lake and<font color="#CCCCCC"> seattle and this</font>

1659
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:18,510
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it gets kind of interesting so</font>

1660
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:20,310
actually what once we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to seattle</font>

1661
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:22,109
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually terminating the</font>

1662
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:24,450
circuit there in the in the westin

1663
01:05:22,109 --> 01:05:26,670
building at the pop we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1664
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:28,680
actually handed it off to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the to the</font>

1665
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:31,410
domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's managed by the the sign at</font>

1666
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:34,049
ranting here basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alien waves so</font>

1667
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:36,240
instead of handing them 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> gig e</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> client</font>

1668
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:38,700
signal we basically said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here's</font>

1669
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:41,220
here's an OTU for right just just keep

1670
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:44,129
transporting this over to the you know

1671
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:46,319
over to the show floor and so you know

1672
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:48,600
these these uh these boxes that were

1673
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:50,820
between the westin building and the

1674
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:53,160
trade show at the convention center

1675
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:54,840
we're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just taking an alien waves</font>

1676
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,190
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the power balancing and</font>

1677
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:57,869
pushing them across and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1678
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:59,760
didn't get converted back in 100 gig e

1679
01:05:57,869 --> 01:06:02,550
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got all the way to the to the</font>

1680
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">show floor so just a little little quick</font>

1681
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:06,450
case study there similarly something

1682
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:09,509
happened basically with the canary wave

1683
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:11,910
it came in from victoria<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> university</font>

finish the build to do the transition

01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:49,230
understand what the impact of doing that

<font color="#CCCCCC">is going to be there are there is a</font>

1706

01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:17,630
concept ends up being commercially

1712
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:20,390
viable eventually we want to do terabit

1713
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:22,340
waves and things like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so just</font>

01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:24,350
finally before before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i end this i just</font>

1715
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:26,090
want to you know just acknowledge

everyone who helped you know make this

1717
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:30,650
work possible there's a lot of some

<font color="#E5E5E5">people here in this room I really helped</font>

1719
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:33,260
make all this possible and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it certainly</font>

1720
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,080
wouldn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been possible to do all</font>

this without without the rest of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ESN</font>

references here forward at night you

1724

need to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sleep any questions or</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I will hungry from life and I was</font>

1727
01:08:03,589 --> 01:08:09,979
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your comment about the 10</font>

1728
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:12,529
x 10's are using the date center<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

1729
01:08:09,979 --> 01:08:14,058
wonder whether we if you think maybe

1730
01:08:12,529 --> 01:08:16,189
would like to see greater failures of

1731
01:08:14,059 --> 01:08:17,839
hundred gig links as a resolve them to

1732
01:08:16,189 --> 01:08:19,308
simply using more fibers because I mean

1733
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:21,170
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the failures of linksys in data</font>

1734
01:08:19,309 --> 01:08:23,150
centers is kind of like someone lent on

1735
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:26,480
the cave or you know the connector was

1736
01:08:23,149 --> 01:08:29,089
dirty isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to wonder</font>

1737
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:32,379
what that might increase right i mean i

1738
01:08:29,089 --> 01:08:34,849
mean with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sr10 basically they have</font>

1739
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:36,500
my understanding is<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have like mpo</font>

1740
01:08:34,849 --> 01:08:38,809
connectors and you know you're basically

1741
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,979
going over multiple strands so if you're

1742
01:08:38,809 --> 01:08:41,630
if you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something other than</font>

1743
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:43,759
like rock to rock or within the same

1744
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:45,078
rack you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you certainly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

1745
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:46,908
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through patch panels</font>

1746
01:08:45,078 --> 01:08:48,799
and actually break out all the fibers

1747
01:08:46,908 --> 01:08:50,778
and try to try to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know have this</font>

1748
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:53,630
octopus cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through patch panels</font>

1749
01:08:50,779 --> 01:08:55,040
and taking it somewhere else right so

1750
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,449
yeah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how that's</font>

1751
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,519
going to how that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pan out I</font>

1752
01:08:56,448 --> 01:09:02,210
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would probably feel comfortable</font>

1753
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:04,489
you know plugging a immuno mpo and to

1754
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:05,868
have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> MPO on both sides and FEMA plug</font>

1755
01:09:04,488 --> 01:09:08,509
that right into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a server or something</font>

1756
01:09:05,868 --> 01:09:10,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that or a router I think that would</font>

1757
01:09:08,509 --> 01:09:13,520
I could probably live with that you know

1758
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,809
from an operational perspective but I

1759
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,460
certainly wouldn't want to start you

1760
01:09:14,809 --> 01:09:18,049
know breaking out<font color="#CCCCCC"> all those individual</font>

1761
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:20,059
fibers and start you know I would just

1762
01:09:18,049 --> 01:09:21,859
do single mode before we before we did

1763
01:09:20,059 --> 01:09:26,599
any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so as the food this video I</font>

1764
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:29,029
guess yeah thanks Andrew<font color="#E5E5E5"> you promised me</font>

1765
01:09:26,599 --> 01:09:30,710
a question so why is it and early

1766
01:09:29,029 --> 01:09:32,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">Indiana University it's just a quick</font>

1767
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:34,849
comment Pendleton is actually not was

TD GFF that there are any<font color="#E5E5E5"> transponders</font>
