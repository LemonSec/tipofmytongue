38
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:11,850
doing is that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not changing in any</font>

198
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:26,339
thought it would be appropriate to talk

00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:29,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">about our most recent than the newest</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">network which we just activated quite</font>

201
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:35,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">recently it's called the all red line</font>

202
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:38,309
why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all red is because all maps</font>

203
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,839
from early in the 20th century British

204
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:44,519
territories used to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a red and it was</font>

205
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,949
obligatory that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> cable should start</font>

206
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,709
and terminate on British territory very

207
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:52,758
important so this being said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> famous</font>

208
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:55,939
network started across the Atlantic in

209
00:11:52,759 --> 00:12:00,240
1866 then there was a connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to</font>

210
00:11:55,939 --> 00:12:04,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">India in 1870 and was prolonged to</font>

211
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:07,379
Australia in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mid-70s 1870s that is</font>

212
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:13,679
and the missing piece at one point in

213
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:15,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">time was from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> canadian dominion to</font>

214
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:19,199
to australia and that's where a

215
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:21,420
committee was set up in 1896 and after a

216
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:24,420
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of discussion it was decided that</font>

217
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,729
the cable was starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> banfield i'm sure</font>

218
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,969
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all know where bamfield is located</font>

219
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,399
it's on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vancouver Island and used to be</font>

220
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:35,160
a cable station which eventually became

221
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,490
tell aglow later on in history so

222
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:41,969
basically cables were not long enough to

223
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:44,639
go in one stretch to all the way to Fiji

224
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:47,189
and Australia so they had to stop in a

225
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:51,720
little at all which is called a Fanning

226
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:54,179
islands and it's located in the Gilbert

227
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,600
Islands now part of curry but if you go

228
00:12:54,179 --> 00:13:00,199
there one day you'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it maybe so</font>

229
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,329
anyway in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build that cable</font>

230
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:05,008
Britain have first to annex the<font color="#E5E5E5"> island</font>

231
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:08,248
so it became British and the cable was

232
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:10,799
built so that was 1902<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course</font>

233
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:13,019
Queen Victoria send the first telegraph

234
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,439
message over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table it had a</font>

235
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:18,569
tremendous capacity of about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 bits per</font>

236
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:21,019
second and by the way the network

237
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:23,510
operating center was in the Queen's

238
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:29,540
castle

239
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:32,270
and and the cable by the way here was

240
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,849
active till 1926 if some of you like

241
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:37,760
scuba diving if you go to banfield and

242
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:41,570
you dive you still can find some pieces

243
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:46,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that 1902 cable then in 1953 it was</font>

244
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:48,200
moved to Port Alberni and 1959 the old

245
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,689
station was closed and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

246
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,290
Port Alberni you had the new and scan

247
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:58,040
cable which lasted till 2002 then the

248
00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:02,380
cable station was sold to a university

249
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:05,449
of victoria and still cable leaving from

250
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">port alberni and coming back it's the</font>

251
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,770
cable is a loop which is on the huon de

252

<font color="#E5E5E5">Fuca tectonic plate with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all kinds of</font>

255
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:22,870
online on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet so this is a long</font>

256
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:27,140
way and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course if we look forward</font>

257
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:30,440
century later 2012 there's a new global

258
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:35,000
around the world network and why is that

259
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:37,670
is because there are cable breaks and if

260
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,270
the eastern side breaks you can go west

261
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:43,760
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> round in fact I think Sylvia gave a</font>

262
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:46,130
presentation on the subject five years

263
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,100
ago here at nano and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way they had</font>

264
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:52,520
the same problem back in 1902 because a

265
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,830
commission of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> british royal army who</font>

266
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,770
included that there needed to be 49

cable cuts in order to isolate<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>
