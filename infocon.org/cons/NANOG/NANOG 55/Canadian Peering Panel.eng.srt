you

for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks agreeing to participate</font>

the main focus of this peering panel

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,880
today is to explore the current state of

194
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:29,370
public peering options in Canada I've

195
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,230
seven specific questions to ask these

196
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,930
panelists and then I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

197
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,430
it up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience for any feedback</font>

198
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:37,109
these questions are those that I get

199
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,270
asked on a regular basis by other

200
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,030
providers and in some cases consumers

201
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:44,040
themselves so it seemed prudent ask our

202
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:49,050
panel of experts their opinions on these

203
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:53,120
questions my first<font color="#CCCCCC"> question for the</font>

204
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:56,219
panelists some Canadians share a concern

205
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,500
excuse me some Canadian share a concern

206
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,990
around the amount of Canadian destined

207
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,110
to traffic the loops into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

208
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:07,110
back I did a really brief survey of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

percent conclusive and only one

215
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,480
viewpoint but I found it interesting

216
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,490
that my potential banking traffic went

217
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">out to Chicago and came back to various</font>

218
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,740
points in Canada for three out of five

219
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,050
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those banks my questions for the</font>

220
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,810
panelists is do you believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

221
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,250
concern is valid if your personal

222
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,619
banking traffic or other sensitive

223
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,900
information goes to another country or

224
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,670
through another country do you find this

225
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,290
concerning and do you believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

226
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,829
potentially more appearing options in

227
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:52,230
Canada<font color="#E5E5E5"> would alleviate the concerns that</font>

228
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:55,730
these folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> have or is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a lack of</font>

229
00:10:52,230 --> 00:11:03,900
peering in Canada who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that first</font>

230
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:06,090
ladies ladies first<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

231
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:09,449
when I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this question I</font>

232
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:15,000
can't answer it in many ways first off

233
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:18,330
as a citizen of Canada I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

234
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,040
while it seemed wrong why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my data</font>

235
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:24,750
going somewhere else then I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

236
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,790
networker I should have asked myself

237
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,640
that question maybe I should have done

238
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,180
some freestyle

239
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:34,750
myself but it never occurred to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and I</font>

240
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:37,900
wondered why is that I do trust my bank

241
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:41,410
to do what's best so I do trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

242
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:43,959
they have a networking team that is

243
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:46,329
protecting my data we do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

244
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,840
laws protecting confidential information

245
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:52,450
especially financial information so it

246
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:56,230
didn't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a big problem for me</font>

247
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:59,110
as a networker though I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're</font>

248
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:02,770
always better served as consumers when

249
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:06,040
the data does not travel long distances

250
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:13,689
so i would encourage my banks to look at

251
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:15,339
alternatives thank you so be John so

252
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:20,800
Sylvie's first mistake is trusting a

253
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:23,200
bank but to her concern a you know as a

254
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,140
resident as well why would my traffic

255
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,210
have to leave even the Toronto area but

256
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,280
then it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> dawned on me well he's an</font>

257
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,860
example TD Bank it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular in the</font>

258
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,770
Boston area so the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of begs the</font>

259
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:39,700
question do Americans now have to come

260
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:41,319
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Canada to do their banking so it</font>

261
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,330
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite interesting it is a valid</font>

262
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">concern you know if I were to ask my</font>

263
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:48,100
mother the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> question she would</font>

264
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,350
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> would have no idea would she</font>

265
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:55,150
care she would definitely question why

266
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:56,460
it has to happen to the second point do

267
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">you believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's potentially</font>

268
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,430
sorry was there more peering options

269
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:03,400
within Canada to alleviate the issue I

270
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:05,800
would say it would it would alleviate

271
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:12,600
part of the problem but<font color="#CCCCCC"> then ends up</font>

272
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:12,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">stirring up other problems Victor</font>

273
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:20,149
so I mean I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a citizen that kind</font>

274
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:22,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">of care of my banking traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those who</font>

275
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:25,490
the US or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably prefer that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

276
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:27,199
didn't but I see it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from an</font>

277
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,319
operator perspective I see it as more

278
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:32,599
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficiency I mean the banking</font>

279
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:34,339
traffic's problem some you know some

280
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,720
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic i might care about it</font>

281
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:38,240
but when we start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about other</font>

282
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">types of traffic which might become more</font>

283
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,779
indicative of the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> i start to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

284
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:43,939
more concerned about how efficiently

285
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,949
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving beds across and can i be</font>

286
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:47,959
more efficient by having more local

287
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:49,878
pairing that can offload things in

288
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:56,779
canada is that pose it shipping<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all</font>

289
00:13:49,879 --> 00:14:04,249
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to the u.s. bill well i</font>

290
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:07,009
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have much to add but but my point</font>

291
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:10,329
is basically the efficiency you know

292
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:13,790
obviously that silly said it exactly

293
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:17,888
yeah you don't want your data traveling

294
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:24,079
all over the place<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to get next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> door</font>

295
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:27,500
but the networks are very dynamic so

296
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,839
even if you did check and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see you know</font>

297
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,579
whether it was very difficult to even

298
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,860
check with content deliveries and

299
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,809
everything else you've a CDN metrics

300
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:40,160
it's very hard to determine exactly

301
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:41,839
where your data is flowing so and the

302
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,629
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are important like financial</font>

303
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:50,500
data are encrypted so theoretically it's

304
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:52,759
there's no security issue as such and

305
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">patrick maybe from a opposite</font>

306
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,189
perspective here the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. traffic come</font>

307
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:00,410
in the canada so there's two things to

308
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:02,329
worry about here<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first one is as a</font>

309
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,559
consumer I look at my banking data and I

310
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:06,109
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know if it should travel across</font>

311
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:08,089
a geopolitical boundary and what that

312
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,350
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the laws the whatever I mean</font>

313
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:11,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sure Canadians are worried about the</font>

314
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,679
Patriot Act<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the Americans are worried</font>

315
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:16,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">about you know some guy on a horse</font>

316
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:18,800
trying to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> down our data but</font>

317
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,089
whether that whether that happens or not

318
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,769
whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypted or not that's a</font>

319
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:24,559
little beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope of what I can</font>

320
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:25,610
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the efficiency that Sylvia</font>

321
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:27,160
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> many others brought up is very</font>

322
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,240
important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me as a networker</font>

323
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,819
unfortunately I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't necessarily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

324
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most efficient thing to</font>

325
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:37,878
always peer at the closest<font color="#E5E5E5"> place right</font>

326
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:39,559
if we have two banks in two towns that

327
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:41,149
are 100 miles<font color="#E5E5E5"> from each other inside of</font>

328
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:44,089
Canada and it takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> miles to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get to</font>

329
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:45,769
the US and back but the amount of

330
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:47,059
traffic between the two cities is five

331
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:49,639
percent of the total it could very

332
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:51,680
easily be more efficient total to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

333
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:53,209
through the United States remember we're

334
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,410
all for-profit businesses I mean to a

335
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:55,910
first approximation I'm sure there's

336
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,920
some educational institutions and

337
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:00,529
whatnot out there but in general<font color="#CCCCCC"> is PS</font>

338
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,599
or for-profit businesses and we want to

339
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:05,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">make money and to make money that means</font>

340
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,959
sometimes doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that may look in</font>

341
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:10,579
a small scope as suboptimal but in the

342
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,680
larger scope will increase the bottom

343
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:14,479
line so going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the US if there's</font>

344
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,099
lots of fiber that's cheap in it going

345
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,899
in that direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be more efficient</font>

346
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,459
than going across you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the frozen</font>

347
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:24,889
tundra when it's expensive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

348
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:26,599
to dig or something thank you so earlier

349
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:28,790
I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight of the larger</font>

350
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,699
providers in Canada just using examples

351
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,920
and using publicly available looking

352
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:36,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">glasses I took a look at these eight</font>

353
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,660
providers to get a feel for how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

354
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:41,509
them appear with one another or if they

355
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,889
purchase transit from one another my

356
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:45,470
interests here light and how the traffic

357
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:48,290
flows between these eight large

358
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:50,149
providers roughly<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaking and</font>

359
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely not conclusive by any means</font>

360
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:55,309
about fifty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of them communicate</font>

361
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,859
directly with one another the number is

362
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:59,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually higher than what I anticipated</font>

363
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,579
the remaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty percent of these</font>

364
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,378
eight large providers go through a

365
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:07,069
transit provider to communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

366
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:10,010
others a bit of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> political question and</font>

367
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:12,529
one that gets asked sometimes is do you

368
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:15,199
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that governments should look at</font>

369
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:17,750
imposing requirements for large telecoms

370
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:22,339
cable companies to connect to IXPs

371
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:23,659
locally in their region and if so those

372
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:25,129
larger companies should provide

373
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:27,199
reasonable peering guidelines for

374
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,429
interconnection it's a bit of a loaded

375
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">question John</font>

376
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,150
okay um should the government get

377
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:43,030
involved probably not a brief discussion

378
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:47,470
earlier today sort of regarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

379
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:48,700
whole thing there's any time the

380
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,560
government is involved with stuff it

381
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,330
seems to either drag on for an extremely

382
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,639
long time or doesn't get sorted out the

383
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:57,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">way that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best interest of</font>

384
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,790
how people want to see it in the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

385
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:03,909
I X's here to have the government

386
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:06,639
regulate telecoms or other providers to

387
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,560
connect to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> X's they may start doing</font>

388
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,600
other tricks to avoid putting traffic

389
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,480
there so again to the day you could end

390
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:22,120
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with less traffic than initially</font>

391
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:27,820
started Sylvia I really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

392
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:31,060
government should impose peering peering

393
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:34,210
as a mandatory thing I've said many many

394
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:36,429
times and<font color="#E5E5E5"> many years ago and haven't</font>

395
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:39,340
changed my mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this I think</font>

396
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:42,220
peering is a commercial<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision it's</font>

397
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:44,530
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy technically to peer what</font>

398
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,330
prevents<font color="#CCCCCC"> people from peering is their</font>

399
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,940
commercial and their<font color="#E5E5E5"> business plan and</font>

400
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:51,129
like Patrick was saying everybody has a

401
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">business plan and every ISP every</font>

402
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,840
content provider has a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan and</font>

403
00:18:53,190 --> 00:19:00,130
you have to trust them to do the right

404
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:03,240
decision for their network so and we do

405
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:07,450
also have examples in the world where

406
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:10,180
governments have imposed IXPs and

407
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:13,870
presence and mandatory peering and

408
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:17,680
they're not successful so what we want

409
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:20,379
is the peering point to be alive and

410
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,080
well and to be alive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you have</font>

411
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,930
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let the ISPs and the content provider</font>

412
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,970
and whomever joins the exchange to do

413
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:33,950
exactly the commercial arrangement that

414
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:37,100
they want to do Thank You Victor

415
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:40,340
so off to<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably concur the last few</font>

416
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,709
folks here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't personally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

417
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,379
you would probably get the right outcome

418
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,720
if the government was to try to craft a

419
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,980
way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this I find that the you</font>

420
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,480
know notion that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's</font>

421
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's commercial benefit of doing it</font>

422
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,130
if it serves a customer base you know

423
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:57,678
people's overall experience is improved

424
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,559
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> do having more pairing that that</font>

425
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,730
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the driver to doing it</font>

426
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:04,519
unfortunately like<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned as well</font>

427
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:06,139
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> various commercial processes</font>

428
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,149
and various companies that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of limit</font>

429
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:10,519
the ability to do this and hopefully we

430
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:11,989
can get past that because you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

431
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">think there's a lot of benefits to be</font>

432
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:17,120
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have better establish parent</font>

433
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:20,629
cross the Canadian operators excellent

434
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,459
Patrick I should point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i speak</font>

435
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:27,580
for myself not from my employer who is

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:30,440
apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> CBC now but anyway sorry aqua</font>

437
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,820
speaking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> myself only the idea that</font>

438
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,039
the government imposed peering is a

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,210
really bad idea all that will do is make

440
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:41,899
a lot of networks exit<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada so I</font>

441
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:49,309
encourage everyone to not do that and

442
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:52,459
built well I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

443
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:56,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">good idea the in Canada with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CRTC</font>

444
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:58,970
and the telcos a lot of the orders were

445
00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:02,120
for cooperation and love and all that

446
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:03,590
successful because a company if it

447
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,129
doesn't want to cooperate and always

448
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:09,379
think of ways to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> life difficult I</font>

449
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:12,679
be more interested in the government

450
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:14,389
themselves in Manitoba I'd be very<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy</font>

451
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,570
for that government in Manitoba to

452
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:19,699
appear with our IX itself you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'd</font>

453
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,210
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy that would be a good step</font>

454
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,510
forward

455
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:28,640
and if there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> business case for for</font>

456
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:33,710
isps to to appear well then fair enough

457
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:36,029
thank you given the large geography of

458
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">Canada which I've talked about and</font>

459
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:42,120
taking into<font color="#CCCCCC"> consideration the limited</font>

460
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,649
number of IXPs I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask each of</font>

461
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,289
the panelists if they believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

462
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:49,020
affects content delivery networks in

463
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:58,470
their ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> effectively deliver the</font>

464
00:21:49,020 --> 00:22:01,529
content Patrick no I was told to keep my

465
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">answers short sorry many content</font>

466
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:05,850
delivery networks are happy to put on

467
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,429
net nodes inside of networks so the lack

468
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:11,820
of a strong pairing base in many places

469
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:15,090
is not a complete and utter inability

470
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:17,428
for us to deliver content locally there

471
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,649
are obviously lower limits you can't put

472
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:21,779
nodes in every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP no matter how</font>

473
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:23,820
small they are so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> X's that can</font>

474
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,909
aggregate many small ISPs into something

475
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,610
that is large enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know require</font>

476
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:33,690
a note a dedicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> node for that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X is</font>

477
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:35,610
useful but the lack of those I X's

478
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,200
either means<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's not enough small</font>

479
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,299
ISPs because otherwise one would grow

480
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,980
organically or that there are enough

481
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:43,590
large ISPs<font color="#E5E5E5"> in which case you can just</font>

482
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:49,950
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> notes on them is that a better more</font>

complete answer Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Sylvie I will</font>

484
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:57,210
draw a parallel here to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

485
00:22:52,500 --> 00:23:01,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">u.s. we have nine large peering metros</font>

486
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:04,799
in Canada there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> three large peering</font>

487
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:07,309
metros and nine large peering metros for

488
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:12,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten times the population in the u.s.</font>

489
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:13,408
seems to have done the trick yes but

490
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,780
those three large peering metros<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

491
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:21,080
Seattle Chicago and

492
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:23,870
New York so I think that content content

493
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:27,080
delivery networks have other means than

494
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:30,290
just peering so by deploying caches in a

495
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,629
network you're effectively going much

496
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:34,970
deeper than appearing point and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

497
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:37,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">what drives benefits to end users</font>

498
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,650
because you're much more closer to them

499
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,990
than if you just leave your traffic at

500
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:48,590
the door of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the peering point so it</font>

501
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:52,730
won't it won't prevent<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdns from</font>

502
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:55,459
deploying the lack of IXPs or the lack

503
00:23:52,730 --> 00:24:02,500
of peering point won't be an impediment

504
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:02,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">to deploy CDN networks thank you Bill</font>

505
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:17,120
well Patrick and and silly answer the

506
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:23,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">question but what has said we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

507
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:23,350
starting an IX in Manitoba and we are

508
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:29,570
we'll be installing back<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my server</font>

509
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,550
and a google<font color="#E5E5E5"> cache server of course the</font>

510
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:36,200

514
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:47,389
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the the approach you can</font>

515
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can do and also the cache servers</font>

516
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:56,590
are still useful just that the CDN are

517
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:59,340
not actually appearing at the the I<font color="#CCCCCC"> axel</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Victor</font>

519
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,230
I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the CDN provider is going</font>

520
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:05,340
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I mean whether they brute</font>

521
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:07,830
force or not they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

522
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">provide to their customer base you know</font>

523
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:11,790
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not there's more or less</font>

524
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,439
exchanges I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't over use the</font>

525
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,540
word efficiency but that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know maybe</font>

526
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,670
there's better ways of doing it i don't

527
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:19,320
know i can't speak on<font color="#E5E5E5"> behalf of you know</font>

528
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:23,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">third party sedans or sedans that I</font>

529
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:25,260
don't want to control so I bet if I look

530
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,909
at it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future from our</font>

531
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:29,520
own contents perspective and how I like

532
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:31,530
that the flow to customer bases I mean I

533
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">would say there's my personal opinion</font>

534
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,460
that I think there's some benefits

535
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:38,429
behind there the one thing I try to do

536
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:41,250
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be new technology guy is I</font>

537
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:42,780
try not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use my old way of thinking to</font>

538
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">define what's the best way of doing</font>

539
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,129
something moving forward so I do agree

540
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,930
there's a lot of established ways and

541
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,370
practices to do things and you know

542
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:52,290
we've gotten pretty good at how we do

543
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:54,719
things in the past but I don't want to

544
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:57,030
limit our ability now kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of putting a</font>

545
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,710
future hat on on you know moving this

546
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,120
thing there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> beast forward by</font>

547
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:01,230
consistently trying to figure out well

548
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,790
if it's worked in the past that

549
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,620
obviously means old work in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future</font>

550
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,480
so I'm always open to trying to figure

551
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,179
out these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> better ways more efficient</font>

552
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,280
ways of doing it one last little example

553
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,450
there is you know there's the whole idol

554
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,820
I figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe people don't care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

555
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:16,110
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the green thing I mean it'd be nice</font>

556
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,540
to be able to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use less electricity</font>

557
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:20,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">no less resources to be able to</font>

558
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:23,330
effectively deliver the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of</font>

559
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:28,940
service to the same amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

560
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:32,120
jointly so one thing to touch on is that

561
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:35,580
at least from only some<font color="#E5E5E5"> torx examples</font>

562
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:37,409
over the past little while we've had a

563
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:40,260
lot of peers come in from very remote

564
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,640
areas in Canada through layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 circuits</font>

565
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,860
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick up some of these</font>

566
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,210
content providers so one way or another

567
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,909
those bits are going to get there

568
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,740
whether it's through these layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

569
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:51,270
circuits that come through or they end

570
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,900
up picking up transit through somebody

571
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:57,620
else so I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll answer</font>

572
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,620
essentially is no

573
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:06,928
so world ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> day is coming up very</font>

574
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:09,299
shortly as we know this is a major

575
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:12,480
milestone for content providers and

576
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:14,340
eyeball networks in my opinion there

577
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,340
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> some transit providers that</font>

578
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:20,250
will provide free ipv6 transit if you're

579
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,720
at a common ixp with them and there are

580
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,860
also some large peers that have

581
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:28,470
restrictive policies on ipv4 appearing

582
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:30,600
but for ipv6 are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> open to peering</font>

583
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:35,250
even with small networks so my question

584
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:38,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">is in your opinion do I XPS contribute</font>

585
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:44,070
towards ipv6 awareness and adoption and

586
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:48,020
i'll start with bill please yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

587
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:52,580
assume they will in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our case though</font>

588
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:57,840
an IXP actually goes a long way to

589
00:27:52,580 --> 00:28:00,389
encouraging acquiring an<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn and then</font>

590
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,120
bgp knowledge and just the whole process

591
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:05,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">of hearing a lot of the big big</font>

592
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:09,989
organizations in when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a</font>

593
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:12,840
don't have any ascends so you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

594
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:15,299
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that an i extent goes towards</font>

595
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,360
improving in the small areas improving

596
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:26,279
the knowledge of networking entirely

597
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:28,770
ipv6 of course Victor it's actually a

598
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:32,909
loaded question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no way off</font>

599
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:34,260
topic on this one whether IX<font color="#CCCCCC"> peas help I</font>

600
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:36,510
mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess some of these practices</font>

601
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,370
have helped although<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think at this</font>

602
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,679
point and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could be wrong neither you</font>

603
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:42,239
know is it on the operator side on you

604
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:45,510
know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> folks in this room I think the</font>

605
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISP I've sorry the ipv6 issues well</font>

606
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:49,020
understood and the need to move towards

607
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:52,860
it i mean there's a very impedance there

608
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:54,090
and but you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think ipv6 adoption</font>

609
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,740
has some had some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> barriers</font>

610
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,299
hopefully in the next couple days some

611
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,450
of those will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> lifted and excuses are</font>

612
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:01,309
removed and we can kind of move forward

613
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,779
but like i said it's had some

614
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:05,899
contribution did did in the earlier days

615
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:07,820
it did have some people asking the right

616
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,500
was I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> found it took a long time to</font>

617
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,659
get the whole operator community to

618
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:14,480
finally realize you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta got</font>

619
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:16,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of figure this one out and and</font>

620
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,690
on the enterprise side but I guess

621
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:20,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's not directly related to the IX</font>

622
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:26,750
piece excellent it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kind of</font>

623
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:29,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">non-answer John I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I acts as a</font>

624
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:32,210
whole I now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously from my</font>

625
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:35,000
viewpoint but from a permit or expect of

626
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:37,700
at least we try to encourage our peers

627
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,250
to reach out to other peers to get their

628
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,930
v6 connectivity flowing in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

629
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,910
cases there's many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that don't</font>

630
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:46,250
know how to where to start necessarily

631
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:49,160
or how to get it set<font color="#E5E5E5"> up so we generally</font>

632
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:50,420
tell them you know fired up we'll send

633
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">them a couple sites to at least get</font>

634
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,600
started with it or get a better

635
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:56,270
understanding of it and suggests them

636
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,610
who they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can reach out to locally to be</font>

637
00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:00,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some testing amongst</font>

638
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:02,360
each other and whatever else like even

639
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,939
all of our welcome package stuff that

640
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,590
goes out to peers always includes v6

641
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,020
information because we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push our</font>

642
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:11,149
peers to once they connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> do their v4</font>

643
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:14,530
and either v6 at the same time so they

644
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:23,660
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about it later on so</font>

645
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:27,610
Sylvie I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it would spur</font>

646
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:30,140
the adoption of v6 or not I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think people</font>

647
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:34,340
well first off I hope you're all

648
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:38,840
deploying ipv6 I mean really<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

649
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:42,230
second or third ipv6 day so if you're

650
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:44,530
not on with the program get started it's

651
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:50,360
going to implode in your face otherwise

652
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:52,820
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know that an IXP would be a</font>

653
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:56,600
motivator<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the motivation has to</font>

654
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:59,360
come from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own network and that you</font>

655
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,600
do believe that this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best path so</font>

656
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,510
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure an IXP has a role to play</font>

657
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:08,090
there but it certainly doesn't hurt I

658
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:10,730
mean it's a good way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test it out and</font>

659
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:15,350
test your<font color="#E5E5E5"> peering policies and test your</font>

660
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:18,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">maps so why not but I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it'd</font>

661
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:24,740
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like yay we can push v6</font>

662
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:26,330
is Patrick so I get this question

663
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:28,490
actually I quite a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times because I'm</font>

664
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:30,710
you know involved with a few internet

665
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:32,779
exchanges I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

666
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:35,059
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet exchange has a nice role</font>

667
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:36,770
to play because participants you know

668
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,990
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other and so you can lob</font>

669
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:41,210
the idea out there the reality is that

670
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:42,529
everybody who's got enough clue to

671
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,120
attach to an internet exchange better i

672
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:45,679
already have enough clue to do v6 and

673
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,600
they better have enough glue to have

674
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:49,460
already done v6 we all know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

675
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">the truth and unfortunately I don't</font>

676
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that the people at the internet</font>

677
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:55,340
exchange are going to change that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

678
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:56,899
it's not like<font color="#CCCCCC"> torques or links or Jay</font>

679
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,699
picks is going to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh what you should</font>

680
00:31:56,899 --> 00:32:02,209
do v6 in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isps going to go oh well</font>

681
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:04,220
what was I thinking I'll do v6 now um it

682
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,750
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sylvie says how to has a nice</font>

683
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">role</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you can you know enable it</font>

684
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,809
on appearing router<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the rest of your</font>

685
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:10,490
backbone our setups and sessions get

686
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:13,279
some idea about it so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

687
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:16,520
small use utility there but reality is

688
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,470
that you guys have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it and the</font>

689
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:22,190
exchange is not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to either help you</font>

690
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:23,570
or be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push you to do it it's got</font>

00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be down into your own networks if</font>

692
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:29,480
it's your own business cases for your

693
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:33,350
own customers for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own reasons good</font>

694
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:36,669
answers thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you when we look at the</font>

695
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:40,370
known active peering points in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Canada</font>

696
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:43,370
there's no I XP in let's say Calgary

697
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:45,799
Alberta just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an example there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

698
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:48,830
several internet providers in the

699
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:50,539
Calgary area so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could conclude that</font>

700
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:53,960
those providers might benefit from

701
00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:56,510
having an IXP so my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is why</font>

702
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,149
do you believe cities such as Calgary do

703
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:01,908
not have an IXP today is it for lack of

704
00:32:59,149 --> 00:33:05,719
interest from those providers funding

705
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:12,830
knowledge why isn't there one there

706
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:16,370
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> sylvie please so if we look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font>

707
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:18,830
model of opening up an IXP what makes

708
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:23,629
enough what what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the conditions that</font>

709
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:25,908
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to have a successful is V first</font>

710
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,799
off I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need a critical mass so</font>

711
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:31,130
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there needs to be sufficient</font>

712
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:32,550
networks in the area that<font color="#CCCCCC"> do want to</font>

713
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:37,440
enter can

714
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:40,270
secondly you need to have fiber

715
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,430
diversity you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

716
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:46,030
there's there's more than one provider

717
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:49,870
going to a location every network has

718
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:52,720
their favorite providers and when you

719
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:55,239
give them the<font color="#E5E5E5"> choice to extend their</font>

720
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,760
backbone to a location and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can do</font>

721
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:00,070
so using their providers you will

722
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,580
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business case to do so</font>

723
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:06,939
so when there is critical mass of

724
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:10,870
providers of networks and where there's

725
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:13,350
also more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than two fiber providers and</font>

726
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:16,389
think you start getting the conditions I

727
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:20,799
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> also say that what you need to</font>

728
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:23,350
have a very strong I XP is you you need

729
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">people like you you need members you</font>

730
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:30,610
need people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will make it work I</font>

731
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:35,409
think the IXPs have had an amazing role

732
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:37,660
in expanding the internet i can think of

733
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:40,029
the seattle exchange in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Toronto</font>

734
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:43,870
exchange that are all member based and

735
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:49,720
volunteers are powering the IXPs and

736
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:52,509
that makes a nugget of collaboration in

737
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:55,540
a city and I think that's important so

738
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:57,970
if the value of an IXP is to make us all

739
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:03,340
work together I think it has a lot of

740
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:07,060
value so I would add that and and it's

741
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:10,560
also a way to collaborate to to make

742
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:13,720
sure that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get closer to users</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

743
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:18,040
so those would be the conditions to open

744
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:22,600
up so the reason is why<font color="#E5E5E5"> Calgary not I</font>

745
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:26,590
don't know but I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> go back again and</font>

746
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:31,390
say do I have a business case to join an

747
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:33,490
IX in Calgary or not and to make my

748
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:35,650
business case I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that i</font>

749
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:38,819
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a sufficient number of</font>

750
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:40,030
peers and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can do so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Kasich</font>

751
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost-effective</font>

752
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:52,090
using by extending my network to that

753
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:53,760
area Patrick so as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was just saying a</font>

754
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:56,440
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> while ago whenever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody says</font>

755
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,760
why does something happen or does

756
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,610
something not happen the answers money

757
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,160
we're all for-profit businesses if

758
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:04,690
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting in Calgary you clearly</font>

759
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,940
have to have a line to somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

760
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:09,310
whether it's Vancouver Toronto Chicago

761
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,680
Seattle somewhere to get to the Internet

762
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,880
in general you may not need a line to

763
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,009
the building<font color="#E5E5E5"> next door where your</font>

764
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,930
competitor is and even if you buy that

765
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:18,730
line<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if it's very very cheap even</font>

766
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:20,140
if you could pair with your competitor

767
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:21,550
which is not at all guaranteed because

768
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:24,220
you know some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to pair</font>

769
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:25,630
with their competitors if only<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

770
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,060
megabit of traffic is going between the

771
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:31,090
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them there's no business</font>

772
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,560
incentive so summary is really just what

773
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,180
Sylvia was trying to say and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

774
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,980
importantly just does it make business

775
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,390
sense if it makes business sense if

776
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,160
there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> compelling business raising</font>

777
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:41,109
you know if it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> break even if it's</font>

778
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,330
closed somebody might overlook it but if

779
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:44,620
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> were a strong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> incentive if</font>

780
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:46,569
somebody could make a lot more money

781
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:48,790
increase their bottom line there would

782
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:50,710
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an exchange since there isn't that</font>

783
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">strong evidence not proved but strong</font>

784
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:54,460
evidence that there is no business<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

785
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,020
there maybe we can change that<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

786
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,610
case by having somebody like Google<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

787
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,110
Akamai or somebody show up and say hey

788
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:01,210
will pair with everybody well everybody

789
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:03,850
now come because it changes the business

790
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:06,370
case but at the moment there's clearly

791
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:11,490
not one for the ISPs in Calgary to do it

792
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:11,490
themselves thank you John

793
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:21,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">Calgary okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Calgary could have up to 50</font>

794
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:24,370
ISPs first question that comes to mind

795
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:27,040
is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> central location is there in</font>

796
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:28,870
Calgary to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like an IXP at</font>

797
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,340
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people may have some</font>

798
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:32,850
reservations regarding connecting to a

799
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:35,890
nice p that isn't in a neutral location

800
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,630
the other thing that comes to mind one

801
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:40,509
of my previous statements with layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

802
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:42,340
circuits it is cheaper to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a layer to</font>

803
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:44,260
certain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Toronto than it is in some</font>

804
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:46,660
cases to go across the street<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Calgary</font>

805
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:49,780
so in a lot of cases people may just run

806
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:51,790
connections elsewhere do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's</font>

807
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,230
a lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge not necessarily you</font>

808
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:54,820
can always turn around<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ask somebody</font>

809
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,230
for some assistance or reach out to the

810
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:59,200
other I axes and see how they're doing

811
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:02,620
stuff in terms of a funding model if

812
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,299
their word<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe a neutral location now</font>

813
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,839
pork started off with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the switch in the</font>

814
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:09,970
back of a beat-up honda so i mean i

815
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:16,690
don't think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily a concern</font>

816
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:18,069
I remember the Honda yeah we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

817
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:19,390
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bikes up in just a few minutes</font>

818
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:25,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">just so I don't keep you standing there</font>

819
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:27,310
too long<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks Victor yeah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

820
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,980
I think everyone's kind of beating the

821
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:31,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">calorie horse down but yeah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

822
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the lack of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interest I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

823
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:34,780
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of operators are probably</font>

824
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:36,669
well if they can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it come if is</font>

825
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,920
commercially viable they might try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

826
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:40,270
it again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think based on how some of</font>

827
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Contra visors have spoken to me</font>

828
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:43,120
there might be some challenges figure

829
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:46,060
out what the what the viability of

830
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:48,250
having an IXP out there might be you

831
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:50,080
know like John mentioned me right now a

832
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:52,330
lot of people make<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business</font>

833
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,430
case is really about cost of circuits

834
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,110
and building with fibers maybe hopefully

835
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:57,640
in the future the business case will

836
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:00,670
include other factors that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are currently</font>

837
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:03,310
not taken into account which include you

838
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:05,020
know maybe operators making or content

839
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:07,570
you know people put content on the

840
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:09,280
content providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> see DNZ</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make it part</font>

841
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,780
of that the deal you know if you're

842
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have my content I want you to</font>

843
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:15,940
have the certain types of assurance

844
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,400
quality quality of assurance

845
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:23,650
so hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might be factored in</font>

846
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:27,370
the future yep excellent and<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill well</font>

847
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:31,650
Calgary Alberta has has a network called

848
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:35,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">super nap which is mostly research but</font>

849
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:38,470
education but it also has<font color="#CCCCCC"> sofa doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

850
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:40,690
businesses as well that may satisfy a

851
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:43,480
lot of the needs for<font color="#E5E5E5"> fur and IX I don't</font>

852
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:48,210
know why we don't don't know in Manitoba

853
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,210
which is somewhat smaller than algorithm

854
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:53,980
is difficult to start an IX because of

855
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,790
the equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the points that Sylvia</font>

856
00:39:53,980 --> 00:40:00,550
and Patrick of have said it it's very

857
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:03,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to get that you know that critical</font>

858
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:09,220
mass it's really really hard

859
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:11,440
particularly when the dominant ISPs the

860
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,799
cable companies and the telcos are don't

861
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,170
seem to be all that interested in

862
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:22,270
joining and IX so I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

863
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:25,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult it's a tough slog thank you so</font>

864
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:27,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">taking the Calgary example a little bit</font>

865
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:30,040

872
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:45,880
a business case for potential

873
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:48,610
development of Canadian IXPs in

874
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,490
different regional areas well the study

875
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:55,060
is still ongoing this raises several key

876
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:57,069
questions in my opinion you know the

877
00:40:55,060 --> 00:41:00,910
ever going question is do we need more

878
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:05,830
Canadian I XP points and if so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what city</font>

879
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:07,810
or cities are appealing given in that

880
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:10,840
some of these identified cities there's

881
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:13,470
no why XP today it's safe<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assume that</font>

882
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:16,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was no business case previously or</font>

883
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:22,209
do we feel that nobody has built a good

884
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:25,509
business case to date John it would be

885
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:26,970
beneficial to have more in terms of

886
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:28,860
locations

887
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:30,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would probably say Montreal in</font>

888
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:34,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">Vancouver out of the two and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason</font>

889
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:36,210
I say that is there's likely more pull

890
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,210
from other international companies

891
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:41,280
whether it's in the US or overseas to

892
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:44,280
land in those locations simply from a

893
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,320
variety standpoint in terms of a

894
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,580
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> case maybe there is a business</font>

895
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,380
case kicking around but maybe there

896
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:52,259
aren't actually any people available<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

897
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:54,120
those cities to start running one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

898
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,790
these exchanges now that's not to say

899
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you couldn't do it remotely but</font>

900
00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:03,690
sometimes you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple local people</font>

901
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:05,340
to kick it off another<font color="#E5E5E5"> Victor again I'm</font>

902
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:08,460
probably in line with with mr. there

903
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:11,190
John mr. sorry I call them mr. JH is

904
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,620
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think Vancouver Montreal are</font>

905
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:16,470
probably pretty good locations<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

906
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:18,420
big metropolitan areas it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

907
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,700
likely easier to build a business case

908
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">around that there's a lot of local</font>

909
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:27,210
talent in those areas to help work the

910
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:29,100
exchanges and help out with that so I

911
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:30,240
think those are probably good places to

912
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,040
have and you know expression the

913
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">Vancouver side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to things it really helps</font>

914
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,029
us because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we talked about the</font>

915
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,290
whole 10 to 1 ratio of population but we

916
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:39,450
have slightly different drivers in

917
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:41,430
Canada and in the US this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

918
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:43,410
about density of population it's about

919
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:45,629
dispersion of population so it would be

920
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:47,069
nice to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to set you know satisfy</font>

921
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,840
the needs of for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> those in the</font>

922
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:51,300
West you know west coast or the west

923
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,830
side of Canada you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm looking at</font>

924
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,660
some other factors of it because of

925
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">distance so we still have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a distance</font>

926
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,220
challenge in Canada so I think that

927
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">plays a bit of why Vancouver might be a</font>

928
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:05,209
good selection as well excellent<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you Sophia please</font>

930
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:10,480
I definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> want appearing exchange in</font>

00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:14,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">Montreal because that's my backyard I</font>

932
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:19,370
think it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I also think</font>

933
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:23,629
that as a as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network planners you can</font>

934
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:26,359
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you can consider Canada as</font>

935
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:28,880
a diverse dirt diver spat for your

936
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:32,110
traffic if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at City pairs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

937
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:36,230
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily take Montreal New York</font>

938
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:40,460
Toronto Chicago and Vancouver Seattle as

939
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:43,130
pairs and you can deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> a redundant</font>

940
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:47,210
paths for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network when you do when</font>

941
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:50,270
you do the the Northern Corridor the

942
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:54,550
former network that employed me Tata

943
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:57,830
Communications have that plan and it was

944
00:43:54,550 --> 00:44:00,830
really really useful when there was an

945
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:06,160
event a networking event or I can think

946
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:10,880
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> brownout in midwest at one time so</font>

947
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:12,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">it you can take I would look beyond the</font>

948
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,810
boundary and say this is North America

949
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:17,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">and look at your network and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

950
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:21,730
look at your fiber routes and make that

951
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:23,960
determination in terms of having a

952
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:27,830
sustainable exchange yeah I think

953
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:31,490
Montreal does have a lot it's really

954
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:35,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">close to New York and it's also well</font>

955
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:39,049
served by European networks so it would

956
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:43,250
be a good a good location and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vancouver</font>

957
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:47,630
as well considering Asian networks and

958
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:51,620
also diversity I think diversity as we

959
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:54,470
grow the internet is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important we</font>

960
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:56,330
should all think of losing a metro what

961
00:44:54,470 --> 00:45:04,129
happens if we lose a metro where does

962
00:44:56,330 --> 00:45:05,450
that traffic go Patrick well my

963
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:06,800
geography sucks to begin with us on

964
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:09,950
sitting up here looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a map of</font>

965
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,170
Canada I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm edmonton they have</font>

966
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:14,328
a we have a hockey team in

967
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:16,520
pretty sure about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so that must be a</font>

968
00:45:14,329 --> 00:45:18,020
big city right I think it's at it and

969
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,849
then how it works I mean we do NFL

970
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:24,430
cities in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys do pal ki</font>

971
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:26,569
cities I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> but back in reality land</font>

972
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:28,040
choose the matter is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care how</font>

973
00:45:26,569 --> 00:45:31,099
many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in a city I don't care</font>

974
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,930
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how many fiber</font>

975
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:36,200
paths or whatever what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for</font>

976
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:37,640
is a hit bang on this drum again but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

977
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,230
looking for money right I'm looking for

978
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,520
a way to making you rich i'm looking for

979
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:42,319
a way to increase the bottom line in

980
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,710
Ruby PS whatever else you want to call

981
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:48,170
it and that is loosely but not / not

982
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:50,420
perfectly related to bits so we look at

983
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:52,099
places like Toronto Toronto is well

984
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:54,170
served by the torques and<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I don't</font>

985
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:56,420
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> there montréal is well served by</font>

986
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:58,460
New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> and his appearing point and</font>

987
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,500
there's not a lot of advantage I don't

988
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:02,390
get performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't increase my you</font>

989
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,819
know I get new customers I can't lower

990
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:06,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">my transit bills there's you know the</font>

991
00:46:04,819 --> 00:46:07,730
long lines are not that cheap or

992
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:08,899
something like that then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

993
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,369
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that and I look at the</font>

994
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,859
edmonton which is a much smaller city

995
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:15,589
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> montreal but perhaps the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

996
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:17,450
costs are much higher to reach there

997
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:19,790
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of things that i look</font>

998
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:22,250
at and everybody in this room should

999
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:23,690
understand exactly how peering works or

1000
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,619
you know most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you should understand</font>

1001
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:26,450
how pairing works and the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1002
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:29,180
hopefully are trying to you know get

1003
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:31,609
there it's a business decision I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1004
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:33,348
make money so while it's fun to look at

1005
00:46:31,609 --> 00:46:35,750
where the hockey teams are and it's

1006
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:37,819
entertaining it doesn't help me increase

1007
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:40,220
my eps and that's really what i'm trying

1008
00:46:37,819 --> 00:46:42,529
to do so look at performance look at

1009
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:44,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">long-haul costs look at you know what</font>

then to Winnipeg or<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes they end</font>

up calling the states and then Toronto

1030
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:47,359
paired together it seems so there was

quite a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest in creating an</font>

say we were ready to the point of

1053
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:02,029
implementing it and sarah said well how

politically use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Manitoba internet</font>

we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop an IX in an area which is</font>

too small to really warrant an obvious

1075
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:26,690
no no I've got a seventh question here

1076
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:28,129
and I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to pick up the pace a</font>

1077
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,710
little bit because I know some people

1078
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:32,210
want to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and ask questions I'm</font>

00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:35,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">just going to ask one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the panelists</font>

1080
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:36,710
this question if that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay content</font>

1082
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:41,299
looking at connecting a new IXPs it

1083
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,250
realize that's a very blanket statement

1084
00:50:41,299 --> 00:50:45,230
but let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a true let's assume that</font>

1085
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:49,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's true for a moment so when</font>

1086
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:51,200
evaluating potential IXPs what are the

1087
00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:53,630
common challenges you see in DC any

1088

challenges in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Canada that are unique to</font>

other locations in the world Sylvia I

1090
00:50:56,690 --> 00:51:00,430
think that'd be a great question for you

1091
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:08,589
you're welcome I was distracted by the

1092
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:12,440
colorful map can you repeat ribbon

1093
00:51:08,589 --> 00:51:14,779
thinking this is great for Patrick<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

him where Nunavut was

00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:30,109
can you repeat<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question yeah so no</font>

1097
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:32,869
I'm not listening it will be ok so when

1098
00:51:30,109 --> 00:51:34,970
evaluating IXPs what are the common

1099
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:37,849
challenges you see and or any of those

1100

1102
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:53,259
question I what's unique it's cold I

1103
00:51:54,730 --> 00:52:02,269
guess I guess I cooling down the gear

1104
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:08,920
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

cheap power is becoming the order of the

day we all know that transit costs are

declining bandwidth costs are declining

1118
00:52:54,200 --> 00:53:02,529
but one thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is steadily</font>

1119
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:07,069
increasing is energy costs so<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy</font>

1121
00:53:07,069 --> 00:53:11,450
it would be a differentiator and it

00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:15,170
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be helpful to set up a business</font>

locate it so I'll be I'd like to have a

regulation in regards to IXPs and you

1152
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:42,849
know what I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> of was what's going</font>

1153
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,609
on and go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> because there is some</font>

1154
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:47,079
form of regulation in Quebec but I'd

1155
00:54:45,609 --> 00:54:49,328
actually like to flip it<font color="#E5E5E5"> around and ask</font>

1156
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:52,270
sometimes regulation is bad but

1157
00:54:49,329 --> 00:54:54,640
incentivization is good we have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

putting internet putting telephone and

1161
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:06,700
communications on North etc would

1162
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:08,288
incentivization be a better way of doing

1163
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:11,169
it rather than regulation or is that

1164
00:55:08,289 --> 00:55:13,329
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the the same dog that the</font>

1168
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,700
the jokes that are in your head right

1169
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:20,700
now

1170
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:40,899
in me buddy else just picking up on your

1171
00:55:38,299 --> 00:55:44,450
question i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say that</font>

1172
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:46,849
incentivization should be definitely to

1173
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:49,490
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet connectivity to rural</font>

1174
00:55:46,849 --> 00:55:53,420
areas or remote area it is a very large

1175
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:59,020
country and as you as you leave the band

1176

1177
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:05,089
becomes increasingly<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to</font>

1178
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:10,520
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet services so you rely a</font>

1179
00:56:05,089 --> 00:56:12,200

1180
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:15,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">are typically networks that are a little</font>

1181
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:18,730
more expensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build so I would if I</font>

1184
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:30,470
access I think when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of an</font>

1185
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:32,899
exchange it's easy for people to make a

1186
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:35,480
business case to join in exchange and

1187
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:39,339
and that should be it should stand on

1188
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:42,380
its own and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if otherwise if you</font>

1189
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:44,299
incentivize and you create an exchange

1190
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:47,299
and it doesn't stand on its own other

1191
00:56:44,299 --> 00:56:50,270
than by government grant or funding it

1192
00:56:47,299 --> 00:56:54,109
will die<font color="#E5E5E5"> because people won't join it</font>

1193
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:56,900
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an initial uptake and then</font>

1194
00:56:54,109 --> 00:57:00,410
it will just<font color="#E5E5E5"> dwindle into oblivion</font>

1195
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:03,020
that's my personal opinion it doesn't

1196
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:07,520
reflect that of my employer or anybody

1197
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:08,930
else thank you so just to quickly touch

1198
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,250
on that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think from an incentive</font>

1199
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:12,470
perspective if there's any type of

government hand<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the thing you're</font>

going to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> some type of say in some</font>

1202
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:22,700
of it um I do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of work in Northern</font>

1203
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:24,950
Ontario and they still have party lines

up there so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1205
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:28,020
getting internet to some of them would

1206
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:30,120
even matter because

1207
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:35,250
just don't you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're fine without</font>

1208
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:37,950
it they also have a comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a bit</font>

saying Canadian tax fees I'd love to

<font color="#E5E5E5">hear from you just a quick question do</font>

1216
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:57,000
commercial grade standards make a

1217
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:59,850
difference in terms of attracting people

1218
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:02,250
or not and should those be written into

1219
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:06,120
some sort of s ellos or anything else or

1220
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:07,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">are they really a discouragement in</font>

1221
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,779
terms of bringing in new peers

1222
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:11,520
commercial grade standards are always

1223
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:13,890
nice you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to fly by night</font>

1224
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,420
place but realize that the most the

1225
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:17,640
largest internet exchanges in the world

1226
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:19,530
are typically have no SLA you know

1227
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:20,879
they're typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> member base they don't</font>

1228
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:22,560
give any money back if they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and</font>

1229
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,880
things like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the members wanted</font>

1230
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,430
to be professionally run they wanted to

1231
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:33,510
be stable but we're not looking for a

1232
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:36,330
telco style SLA in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the</font>

1233
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:40,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet is built on what we we called</font>

1234
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:45,299
best effort but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to be realistic</font>

1235
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:48,810
and best effort is pretty much golden I

1236
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:54,630
don't know of any ISPs that don't have

1237
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:57,660
five nines or really bad uptime or

1238
00:58:54,630 --> 00:59:01,470
packet loss everybody is vying for the

1239
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:05,370
same customers and best effort is really

1240
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:07,830
golden so I don't think s la's would

1241
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:09,330
make any<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference I think everybody in</font>

1242
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:11,310
the room here wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build good</font>

1243
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:14,790
networks and they won't they won't

1244
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:19,730
settle for a lesser quality so we just

1245
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:24,840
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way we build it thank you</font>

1246
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:27,210
yeah yes sir 10 Bloomberg again so in

1247
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:30,060
the one thing i saw that is different

1248
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:33,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> canada is that in the u.s. a</font>

1249
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:35,040
mom-and-pop isp probably starts at<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50</font>

1250
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:38,070
million dollars of revenue and that's

1251
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:40,380
considered mom and pop in canada we have

1252
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:43,290
because of the regulatory framework etc

1253
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:45,270
we have a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> smaller ISPs half a</font>

1254
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:47,790
million 1 million five million dollars

1255
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:50,850
in revenue lots of pockets of ISPs where

1256
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:52,440
you might only have five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> three is BS</font>

1257
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:54,660
in the town in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. you might have</font>

1258
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,340
fifty or a hundred like in Montreal they

1259
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:59,250
are probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a hundred is BS in</font>

1260
00:59:56,340 --> 01:00:02,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">Montreal that don't connect to an IXP</font>

1261
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:04,590
today because the cost to get Toronto as

1262
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:06,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">an example is too much but if there was</font>

1263
01:00:04,590 --> 01:00:08,640
one in Montreal or Vancouver you'd have

1264
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:13,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">all these smaller players suddenly</font>

1265
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:15,900
connecting is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that an accurate</font>

1266
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:19,200
difference between the US and<font color="#CCCCCC"> canada in</font>

1267
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:22,010
terms of the network makeups that there

1268
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:26,879
are lots lot more smaller providers

1269
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:28,560
compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously if</font>

1270
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,360
there are more providers and it's

1271
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,560
clearly a difference right I mean this I

1272
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,270
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question is a little Tut</font>

1273
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,560
illogical<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi we have more providers is</font>

1274
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:36,690
that different than the US where you

1275
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:39,630
have fewer providers the answer is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

1276
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:41,580
of yes would it matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that mean</font>

1277
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:43,830
that you should have exchanges that's up

1278
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:46,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the smaller providers you know it's</font>

1279
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:48,360
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> peering is not free as we've said for</font>

1280
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,529
years and years so if you have somebody

1281
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:52,200
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> half a million dollars with the</font>

1282
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:54,150
revenue and it costs him five grand to

1283
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:57,149
you know go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the building bring up a</font>

1284
01:00:54,150 --> 01:01:00,150
quarter rack by the equipment in set of

1285
01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:01,710
peering is that worth it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to him or it</font>

1286
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:03,120
will he only save five megabits of

1287
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:06,630
transit which costs him you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:09,120
question whether it's useful or not

1290
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:11,310
because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough about the</font>

1291
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:13,170
smaller providers it's up to them and if

1292
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:15,299
they do or if they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it would</font>

1293
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:17,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">be useful to have somebody like Google</font>

or meijer you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody else out</font>

1295
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">there to come and peer with them all</font>

1296
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:23,550
they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is email us we are more</font>

1297
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:24,930
than happy to discuss it<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them but I</font>

1298
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:26,550
can tell you right now one guy got

1299
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:27,960
emails us and says hi we'd like to set

1300
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:29,880
up an exchange and it's one small

1301
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:32,370
provider with one small amount of

1302
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,720
peering traffic the answer is going to

1303
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:35,460
be no you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them together so</font>

1304
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:40,520
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each other you have ISP</font>

associations you can do it a

1306
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:46,630
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been so careful not to say that the</font>

connection to it and lots of big

1317
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:20,200
providers there and it does very well so

1318
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:21,880
you know you can join us<font color="#E5E5E5"> technically</font>

1323
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:33,670
anybody from pier 1 it definitely would

1324

be nice to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear more about it and I do</font>

aqua doesn't have a router in Vancouver

1327
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:41,259
but apparently that exchange is

you know on the same route is the six

<font color="#CCCCCC">that connection is in our connection</font>

1341
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:12,850
that harper center so yes there is a and

well thank you we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> running out of</font>

1344
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:18,279
time so just one more quick question

1345
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:21,700
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> please yeah it's going to be quite</font>

1346
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:23,740
godly Cosby from CBC how successful our

1347
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:25,509
Canadian<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet exchange is compared</font>

1348
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:28,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the rest of the world</font>

1349
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:30,260
the the rest of the world is vastly

1350
01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:32,000
different right so you have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1351
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:35,210
am-6 and links and<font color="#E5E5E5"> d cakes which have</font>

1352
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,130
terabits traffic i was i was looking at

1353
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:40,550
stuff like all<font color="#CCCCCC"> Equinix exchanges around</font>

1354
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:42,200
the world are less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a single track</font>

1355
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:45,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">these less than the total traffic of</font>

1356
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:47,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">am-6 by itself literally so would you</font>

1357
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:49,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">consider equinix not successful yes or</font>

1358
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,839
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it's it's hard to say what is</font>

1359
01:03:49,069 --> 01:03:52,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the metric of success number of peers</font>

1360
01:03:50,839 --> 01:03:54,109
number of routes number of megabits

1361
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:56,150
whatever the Toronto internet exchange

1362
01:03:54,109 --> 01:03:58,759
is smaller than almost every you know

1363
01:03:56,150 --> 01:04:01,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">major exchange in the US but I would not</font>

1364
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,599
consider it I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even begin to</font>

1365
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:06,319
consider it unsuccessful it's very

1366
01:04:02,599 --> 01:04:08,420
successful I die but the rest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Canada</font>

1367
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:09,770
i would i would consider toronto to be

1368
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:14,540
honestly the only quote unquote

1369
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:17,119
successful exchange I think the there's

1370
01:04:14,540 --> 01:04:19,970
a somewhat an evolution for your network

1371
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">as well when you start peering on an IX</font>

1372
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:24,618
at one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in time you do make a</font>

1373
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:26,540
determination that it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be too much</font>

1374
01:04:24,619 --> 01:04:29,900
traffic on the public fabric and you

1375
01:04:26,540 --> 01:04:33,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefer to pry to privately pier with</font>

1376
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:36,829
another network and again that's why the

1377
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:39,440
neutrality of the site and the abundance

1378
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:44,140
of fiber providers to help you do those

1379
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:50,630
private connections by Iran is important

1380
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:51,828
great thanks next week we're kind of

1381
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:53,810
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> really out of time they're going</font>

1382
01:04:51,829 --> 01:04:55,940
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at me soon but you</font>

1383
01:04:53,810 --> 01:04:58,279
have a quick question very quick just a

1384
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:00,890
point of clarification when you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1385
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:04,430
talking about the terabits per second of

1386
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:07,190
peering traffic that's very often the

1387
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:09,020
public traffic that you can see so when

1388
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:11,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">Patrick says you know these guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1389
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:13,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">these big terabit per second exchanges</font>

1390
01:05:11,329 --> 01:05:16,430
as public hearing fabrics other

1391
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:18,379
facilities like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> equinix for example</font>

1392
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:20,810
would have an enormous<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of traffic</font>

1393
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:23,150
going privately between parties that you

1394
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:25,250
cannot see so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult to</font>

1395
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:28,030
compare the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> um the private peering</font>

1396
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:30,230
is by definition not exchange traffic

1397
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:32,420
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> one 11-8 has a lot of</font>

1398
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:33,790
privateering if you take you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

1399
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:35,320
exchanges out of it

1400
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:36,540
the point is yes there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1401
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,860
buildings with lots of private

1402
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:41,020
connectivity the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> was are the</font>

1403
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:43,720
exchange is successful and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font>

1404
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:46,150
the internet exchange generally consists

1405
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:48,279
of both public and private peering that

1406
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:49,900
goes on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I woodsy I would disagree</font>

1407
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:51,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that because if you take Equinix</font>

1408
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:54,430
and packs<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the loop if you look at</font>

1409
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:59,230
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know links as a private private</font>

1410
01:05:54,430 --> 01:06:01,390
peering product but m6d cakes tour<font color="#CCCCCC"> x 6 j</font>

1411
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:02,440
pics etc do not they don't own the

1412
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:05,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">buildings they don't own the facility's</font>

1413
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:09,040
they are not in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> way related to the</font>

1414
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:10,390
private peering so no the exchanges

1415
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,370
exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> and private peering is private</font>

1416
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:14,080
peering now it's perfectly valid to say

1417
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:17,500
that one is useful and the other is also

1418
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:19,569
useful but they are separate I was just

1419
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:21,910
close by saying I disagree I think the

1420
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:23,350
public and private<font color="#CCCCCC"> period collectively</font>

1421
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:26,100
is what makes the exchange valuable

1422
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:31,930
whether you use one or both or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hybrid</font>

1423
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:34,150
anyway that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool thank you heard I</font>

1424
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:37,330
think we're out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of we're out of time</font>

1425
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:39,340
here folks sorry to cut cheese off I
