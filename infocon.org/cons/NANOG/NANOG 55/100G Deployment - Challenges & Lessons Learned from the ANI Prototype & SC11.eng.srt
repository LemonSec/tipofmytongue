1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you very much next up we</font>

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:17,640
have Chris Tracy from<font color="#CCCCCC"> es net talking</font>

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:20,630
about hundred gig hello there now for

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:24,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">something completely different I think</font>

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:27,590
where's the clicker right there yeah

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,150
just a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> green button on top thank you</font>

7
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:34,590
hello good afternoon I'm Chris Tracy

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,390
from from es net day s 293 going to be

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:41,160
talking about 100 gig today and our

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,870
experiences so just a I have to

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,480
apologize the title of this talk might

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,370
have been somewhat miss named might have

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,779
led you to believe that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,629
experimenting with 100 gig and it's

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,039
actually definitely not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case we're</font>

16
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,379
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing the middle deploying a</font>

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,649
production hundred gig backbone across

18
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,480
the nation so much of this material and

19
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,760
in our operational experience was built

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,619
on on our initial experiences with

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,170
deploying this coast to coast prototype

22
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,670
under Teague network but just in a few

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,350
months this will all be transitioned to

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,330
production production quality hundred

25
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,130
cake network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font>

26
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,320
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few things that we learned with our</font>

27
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,699
initial turn up but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to</font>

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,798
clear up any confusion about<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,159
than not this is a real<font color="#CCCCCC"> network because</font>

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,710
because it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's just a quick</font>

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,360
outline of the of attack I'm sure you're

32
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,210
all capable of reading so I'm just going

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get on with it and start into a quick</font>

34
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,630
overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we call a and I and an</font>

35
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:39,059

36
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,890
advanced network initiative was are

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,649
funded program that was intended

38
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,240
intended really to accelerate the

39
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:48,149
commercialization 100 gig by deploying a

40
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,250
nationwide hundred kick<font color="#E5E5E5"> backbone and so</font>

41
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,310
what we essentially have today is a

42
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,479
pre-production 100 gig network that has

43
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,240
hundreds 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> gig circuits stretching</font>

44
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,469
across the country it links the three

45
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,298
major department of energy

46
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,100

52
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,130
the

we<font color="#CCCCCC"> base get another entirely dark</font>

54
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,060
footprint which spans the nation this is

55
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:23,410
actually a separate fiber pair thats

56
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,940
it's mostly congruent to the the lid the

57
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,579
lid network that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about in a</font>

58
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,940
few moments you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know with the exception</font>

59
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:33,250
of some<font color="#CCCCCC"> Metro strands this this fiber is</font>

60
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,440
completely dark we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually actively</font>

61
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,080
looking for researchers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> or vendors</font>

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,950
to to work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> us as submit proposals</font>

63
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,230
to use this<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to field trials and</font>

64
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,750
approval technologies like like flexible

66
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:52,090
things like that finally we have an

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,340
experimental test bed is deployed at

68
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,950
three locations at nurse Corrigan and

69
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,900
brookhaven this basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> consists of</font>

70
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-performance hosts that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are capable</font>

71
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,090
of sourcing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sinking traffic at it up</font>

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,640
to 100 Gig per second I have a bunch of

73
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,160
open flow switches virtual machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts</font>

74
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,690
open flow controllers conventional

75
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,640
routers and switches all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

76
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you might want for for</font>

77
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing different types of research on</font>

78
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,360
networks even some some layer one

79
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,130
optical gear the primary purpose of this

80
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,770
test fit is really to facilitate network

81
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,959
research and like with the dark fiber

82
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,550
footprint were we're actually actively

83
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,320
supporting a number of different funded

84
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:30,700
research projects who are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

85
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,390
this infrastructure to support their

86
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:36,100
work and finally it's also very<font color="#CCCCCC"> helpful</font>

87
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,450
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our own engineering staff because we</font>

88
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,340
we also get access to all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

89
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:43,089
resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our own testing and</font>

90
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:44,709
development so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how many</font>

91
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,330
people here are really<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

92
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:49,180
supercomputing conference for those that

93
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,620
aren't just stay with me there's a you

94
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,040
know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big conference every</font>

95
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,060
year in November very much focused on

96
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-performance networking</font>

97
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,510
high-performance computing all the big

98
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,829
networking vendors are there all the big

99
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,350
you know high performance computing

100
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,060
vendors are there it's a big big

101
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,579
conference you know ten to fifteen

102
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,959
thousand people probably and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font>

103
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,270
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where there's always a big push</font>

104
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,930
to see you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast we can make the</font>

105
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:15,750
network that year and so it the last

106
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,640
supercomputing in 2011 was in Seattle

107
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,488
what we essentially ended up with at the

108
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,460
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> was were 700 gig circuits one of</font>

109
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:24,289
which

110
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,880
and all the way into Seattle talk a

111
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:30,860
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the engineering of</font>

112
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:32,750
that link at the end and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we basically</font>

113
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,729
turned up seven seven hundred gig waves

114
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,530
that are depicted here in the map the

115
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:38,680
smaller green dots are showing the the

116
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:41,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">locations of the optical add drop points</font>

117
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,000
in this particular case the small dots

118
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,710
ended up being the hundred gig regions

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,680
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of the longer circuits</font>

120
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,690
really that you know the circuits

121
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,030
terminate on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the larger dots which are</font>

122
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">shown here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the larger dots are also</font>

123
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:57,049
optical a drop points but they really

124
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">show where we deployed hundred gig</font>

125
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,949
routers at for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know for to</font>

126
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:03,680
build this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> network for</font>

127
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:05,389
supercomputing this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically</font>

128
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,370
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client handoff from the from</font>

129
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:12,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">the optical transport gear to the router</font>

130
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,759
occurred so so moving on is just that

131
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:15,349
was sort of a quick overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a and I</font>

132
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,159
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now where we're going with this</font>

133
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:20,539
is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really to what we call es net five</font>

134
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:22,009
throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that whole roll out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

135
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:24,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">the prototype network I just discussed</font>

136
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:25,400
our intention has always been to

137
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:27,590
basically build something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font>

138
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,960
ultimately be transitioned to production

139
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,690
and inform the core of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our of our next</font>

140
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,549
generation<font color="#CCCCCC"> network so ESN five is</font>

141
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,650
ultimately what what and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will morph</font>

142
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,630
into and and this will completely

143
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,880
supplant the current the current network

144
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,340
known as he isn't it for so this map is

145
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,770
just is showing the optical design is

146
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:49,520
this essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> consists of 13,000</font>

147
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,289
miles of lit fiber all of which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:57,710
manage the the wave capacity across the

00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,370
actually shared with our with our

152
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,320

153
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,289
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these on these links we've divided</font>

the wave capacity and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the system</font>

155
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:10,940
is engineered for fulfil so we we

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,740
divided up to between<font color="#CCCCCC"> 88 channels</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

157
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,830

160

channel capacity to ourselves there so

162
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:29,360
as of today last I checked we were we

163
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:31,580
were over 200 amp nodes deployed across

164
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,229
this network there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still some work</font>

167
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,860
I think it's Seattle<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to LA or so a</font>

168
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,780
lot of nodes are I think still in the

169
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,060
process of<font color="#E5E5E5"> being brought up I think</font>

170
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,059
we're anticipating about over 300 or

171
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,350
maybe 350 amp know<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly when it when</font>

172
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,389
everything is finally finished being

00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:54,280
built out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of out of all those nodes we</font>

174
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:57,760
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a bunch of a drop points just</font>

175
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,950
shown by the black circles and these are

176
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,020
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are essentially where we can add</font>

177
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:05,919
drop client signals and install

178
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:08,680
transponders and so these these are

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially mems-based multi-degree Road</font>

181
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,770

00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:22,000
they can they can do locally add they

185
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,460
can locally a drop channels and either

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,520
connect to clients or form regions for

187
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:30,489
four long circuits and 15 of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes</font>

188
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,659
particularly in the metro metro areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

189
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,180
have what we call directionless

190
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,800
capabilities by directionless we really

191
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,900
mean that the waves that terminate on

192
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,820
that node can actually be optically

193
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,370
rerouted either<font color="#E5E5E5"> either east or west</font>

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">without physically moving any fiber at</font>

195
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:47,440
the at that sign so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is particularly</font>

196
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful in in the metro areas where we</font>

197
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,020
know we might want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually rear out</font>

198
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,180
circuits in the event of fiber cuts

199
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,049
since we're provisioning all these

200
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,460
circuits without any kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of protection</font>

201
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,910
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting close to working our</font>

202
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,469
way here up to up to layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

203
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:07,090
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide you'll actually see how</font>

204
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:08,560
all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2300 circuits and you know see</font>

205
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,760
where they're all actually landing at

206
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,650
and where all the routers are deployed

207
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,690
so but shown here are just two examples

208
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,900
of hundred gig circuits across the wide

209
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,639
area as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a metro the circuits are</font>

210
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,229
handed off<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 gig routers it they're</font>

211
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,630
deployed at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the endpoints of these</font>

212
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:25,090
circuits and if the circuit extends

213
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:29,500
quite far like that one from Sacramento

214
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:31,840
to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's Denver is usually one or</font>

215
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,070
more regions required along you know

216
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,799
somewhere in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ensure an</font>

217
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,700
error-free link and so currently we're

218
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:43,169
targeting 23<font color="#CCCCCC"> lambdas to turn up by</font>

219
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:45,720
by the early fall this year so in total

220
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,250
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support all those 23</font>

221
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,770
circuits we we obviously need to have

222
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,420
transponders were determining but you

223
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,970
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> for many of these we also required</font>

224
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,310
a lot of regions in the middle and so

225
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:59,490
800 gig the cost for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> can-can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

227
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,620
as possible we've strived to to minimize

228
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,570
the number of overall regions by you

229
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,300
know using optical modelers and

230
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:12,510
carefully selecting the hardware in some

231
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,790
cases even having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to wait possibly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> till</font>

234
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:22,069
better performance for example so here's

235
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:25,470
here's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> picture of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rounded network</font>

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,840
up the stack here our current target

right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 routers that are going</font>

this up with real applications that are

<font color="#E5E5E5">that does is allow for error correction</font>

error-free links over like you know

283
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:30,230
1,800 kilometers this does increase the

284
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,740
bit rate for that single wavelength up

285
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:36,380
to about 112 gigabit range due to that

286

extra added overhead but but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> effect</font>

the required optical signal noise ratio

and finally a modulation scheme that's

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,839
known as dual polarization quadrature

292
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,140
phase-shift keying is used to squeeze

293
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,810
that entire 112 gig signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it into</font>

294
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:00,620
this little 50 gigahertz window of

295
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:03,140
optical spectrum and so since i since i

296
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,490
mentioned DP<font color="#E5E5E5"> qpsk we might as well talk</font>

297
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,280
a little bit about what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

298
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,740
that is in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in order to</font>

299
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,740
increase the channel line rates going

300
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:15,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">from 1 to 10 was simply a matter of just</font>

301
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">increasing the simple rate symbols were</font>

302
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,370
just binary intensity modulation we

303
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,569
could go from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 to 10 with a single</font>

304
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,330
carrier without having to do anything

305
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:25,400
particularly fancy the commercial

306
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:27,410
success of 10 gig has really led to

307
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,810
quite a cost reduction of all these 10

308
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,579
gigabyte components so instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

309
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,650
changing the the symbol rate drastically

310
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">hundred gig has really looked into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

311
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:38,900
other ways of leveraging the existing

312
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,810
technology and trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find other ways</font>

313
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,730
to to increase the channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> bitrate so</font>

314
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:46,069
dual polarization was one way to achieve

315
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,530
this you can take polarization

316
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,090
multiplexers and and basically double

317
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:52,150
the channel great channel bit right by

318
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:55,070
by just simply combining two orthogonal

319
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:56,480
polarizations so this this actually

320
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,100
doesn't change the amount of optical

321
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,500
spectrum that's needed

322
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,509
that's actually used on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber but it</font>

323
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,490
still allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to double the channel</font>

324
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:06,310
bitrate so the graphic here that's

325
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,480
highlighted in the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> red box is</font>

326
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:10,339
intended to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of visualize this</font>

327
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,470
concept shows how there's a horizontal

328
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:15,199
on a vertical polarization that are

329
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:17,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">multiplexing to one signal and so in</font>

330
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:20,359
addition to keep costs low you can even

331
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">use a single laser and have multitude</font>

332
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,889
modulators to drive a cost down for so

333
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:28,008
you use the same transmitter for both

334
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:29,300
polarizations and so this this technique

335
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:31,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">turns out to work with or without</font>

336
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,439
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called coherent detection that</font>

337
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about in a</font>

338
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,440

339
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:40,759
detection is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a most</font>

340
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost-effective way to do this so moving</font>

341
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,470
on to the the modulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheme the the</font>

342
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:47,630
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> technique that's used to increase</font>

343
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:49,880
increase the channel bitrate and avoid

344
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:53,240
increasing the symbol rate is to use

345
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,829
this fancy modulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheme instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

346
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,720
using something like on-off keying we're

347
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:58,040
returning the laser on and off we're

348
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,380
basically changing the phase of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

349
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,810
signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the optical carrier to encode</font>

350
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,060
the data so in other words phase shift

351
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,619
keying<font color="#E5E5E5"> quadrature phase-shift keying</font>

352
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,420
just just means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're using for</font>

353
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,029
optical phases with each phase

354
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,130
representing two bits so this this red

355
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:15,980
box kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sort of depicts the in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

358

really reduced the required speed of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

now possible to leverage the you know

366

the existing CMOS available today and

<font color="#CCCCCC">I was talking about so from so here's an</font>

370
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:50,480
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this looks like from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">from a spectrum perspective in the</font>

372
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,069
middle there's a hundred gig signal this

00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:57,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">is basically two carriers space 20</font>

running<font color="#E5E5E5"> it about 14 gig</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abad so what we</font>

376
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:04,370
basically have here are two carriers we

377
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,589
have two polarizations and we have two

378

bits per symbol from from those

379
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:10,370
constellation diagrams we just looked at

380
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:11,059
so what we end up with these these<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">14</font>

384
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:20,329
pop up the the channel spacing here and

385
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,159
you can you can see this quiet<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fits</font>

386
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:24,378
quite nicely into a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 gigahertz</font>

387
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,509
spectrum the other thing that's clear

388
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:28,489
here is that the spectral efficiency of

389
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:30,529
these hundred gig signals is quite a bit

390
00:15:28,489 --> 00:15:32,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">better there's there's actually less</font>

391
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,429
wasted spectrum you can kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see when</font>

392
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:37,309
you compared to the to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 and the 40</font>

393
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:39,499
gig signal you're using more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

394
00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:43,549
available there in that 50 gigahertz

395
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:45,619
band right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I briefly mentioned</font>

396
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:46,848
coherent detection a few slides back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

397
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:48,919
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to elaborate a little bit more</font>

398
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:51,319
on that this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really the</font>

399
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:53,299
breakthrough technology that that's did

400
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:55,189
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my opinion is changing</font>

401
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:58,848
everything this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> originally designed</font>

402
00:15:55,189 --> 00:16:00,589
back in the 70s or 80s and<font color="#CCCCCC"> but really</font>

403
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:02,689
optical am proved to be a cheaper and

404
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:04,429
easier way to improve the noise

405
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:07,608
tolerance so so a lot of this work on

406
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:09,259
coherent was was largely abandoned you

407
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:11,689
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started placing amps every 50 to</font>

408
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,889
100<font color="#E5E5E5"> kilometers and problems or basically</font>

409
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:15,858
solved and we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worry about</font>

410
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:18,229
this so the coherent detection is been

411
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:19,789
sort of rejuvenated due to the all the

412
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:21,949
advances<font color="#CCCCCC"> in digital signal processing</font>

413
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:25,009
the number of gates operating

414
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:26,569
frequencies have all changed so now we

415
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:28,419
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> process these these kinds</font>

416
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:30,108
of signals and apply these sophisticated

417
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:33,409
transformations in order to do this

418
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:36,979
signal recovery you know two things like

419
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:38,869
hundred gig and really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the there are two</font>

420
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:40,879
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is is really changing</font>

421
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:43,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really leading to the elimination</font>

422
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">of needing dispersion compensating fiber</font>

423
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:47,839
chromatic dispersion is just simply no

424
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:50,988
longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> a limiting factor like it has</font>

425
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,339
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 10 gig and the other neat thing</font>

426
00:16:50,989 --> 00:16:55,069
about coherent detection is that it

427
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:56,659
really works like a radio receiver you

428
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:58,279
know you you basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> tune a local</font>

429
00:16:56,659 --> 00:17:00,709
oscillator to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> frequency you're</font>

430
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:03,709
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in so it's it's frequency</font>

431
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:05,720
selective this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is proved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be quite a</font>

432
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:08,148
breakthrough in optical filtering

433
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,029
because so far optical filter technology

434
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:13,158
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been very disappointing it's never</font>

435
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:15,019
really been matured to the point where

436
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:16,819
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost effective so things like</font>

437
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:19,638
<font color="#CCCCCC">colourless Rotom architectures have</font>

438
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:21,589
never really gotten very far because the

439
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,938
optical filtering technology is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

440
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:23,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just never matured to the point</font>

441
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:26,460
where it's

442
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:28,079
cost-effective<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this and finally</font>

443
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">colorless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rotom you know our</font>

444
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,429
architectures are now being created now

445
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:34,710
that this technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> is here and</font>

446
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,530
becoming reality so we will finally

447
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,270
really have the you know the complete

448
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,980
software reprogram ability of the

449
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:43,110
optical layer using coherent detection

450
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,030
so you once you bring this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing up</font>

451
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,850
you're not going to have to move fibers

452
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,020
around in order to you know if you tuned

453
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,399
to a different wavelength you're just

454
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,210
going to automatically be able to shoot

455
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,680
that wave on to wherever it needs to go

456
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,930
there's a few interesting side effects

457
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,360
of this one of them is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know</font>

458
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">really we no longer really need fixed</font>

459
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,770
optical filters components such as the

460
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">reed waveguide gratings that are very</font>

461
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,940
common in DWDM systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> would basically</font>

462
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,260
be pulled out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and replaced with</font>

463
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,180
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of components</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

464
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,640
essentially two splitters and combiners

465
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,500
and things like that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and if we</font>

466
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,720
no longer have a need for for fixed

467
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:21,510
optical filters we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need a</font>

468
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,400
fixed wavelength grid and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

469
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,610
don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually stay aligned to</font>

470
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,380
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITU grid and longer and ultimately</font>

471
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:30,330
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make more</font>

472
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,190
efficient use of the spectrum will be

473
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,320
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pack in channels that that</font>

474
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,790
require more bandwidth or less bandwidth

475
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,929
it would be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pack them closer and</font>

476
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,389
give them the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of band what they</font>

477
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,710
need this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to this is actually</font>

478
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,240
going to require a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new wave length</font>

479
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">selectable switches that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could actually</font>

480
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,440
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this concept but but I</font>

481
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,440
think in time or we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see this</font>

482
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,520
so one interesting thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

483
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,290
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of all of this is that amp</font>

484
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,690
placement<font color="#E5E5E5"> has become a really important</font>

485
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:01,050
issue it's not just if you want to go

486
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,640
above 100 gig to 400 cake or one terabit

487
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,649
but but even just staying at 100 gig

488
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,660
we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the effects of</font>

490
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,430
for additional regions in the network it

491
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,140
can be a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a balancing act to some</font>

492
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,870
extent right you know do i add another

493
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:18,240
100 gig region here or can<font color="#CCCCCC"> i take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

maybe break those up into<font color="#CCCCCC"> some shorter</font>

496

498
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">is really is really what is you know</font>

499
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the key factor in</font>

501
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:37,290
bitrate channels the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea IM spacing you</font>

502
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,150
know what your system is designed for is

503
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:41,370
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily going to match</font>

504
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,140
reality when you when you actually get

505
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,760
into a field and you know get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your fiber</font>

506
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,940
and you start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

507
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,950
right so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have so this</font>

508
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,140
has had some very real impacts on on the

509
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,360
advertised reach for example of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hour</font>

510
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,790
hundred gig long-haul components and has

511
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,770
you know essentially driven us to need

512
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:02,460
more regions than you know you initially

513
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,960
think you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need so just</font>

514
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,690
getting back to the the flexible grid

515
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,730
idea just for from one moment if you

516
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,170
want to go up beyond 100 gig at some

517
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,180
point we're going to hit a limit where

518
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,340
we're going to require a better and

519
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,750
better signor noise ratio which at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

520
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,810
point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just it's just not going to be</font>

521
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:21,120
achievable and so you know one<font color="#CCCCCC"> way is to</font>

522
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:23,490
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> about we could put ultra low loss</font>

523
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,709
fiber all in the ground everywhere which

524
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:28,110
is probably not a very very viable

525
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,270
option you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably going to</font>

526
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">be stuck with the fiber we have for for</font>

527
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,900
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

528
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,699
reasons why flexible grid could be very

529
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,200
beneficial because we can we can simply

530
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,120
throw more spectrum at the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

531
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,580
not have to worry as<font color="#CCCCCC"> much about the OSN</font>

532
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,649
are so you can see what's being depicted

533
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,409
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're 100 Gig channels</font>

534
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,090
and are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you know a certain</font>

535
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,280
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of spectrum but you know once you</font>

536
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:53,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a terabit waves you might give</font>

537
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,690
those a 150 gigahertz a spectrum and you

538
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,130
know you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this would require</font>

539
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,720
again all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wavelengths selectable</font>

540
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,660
switch components to support all this

541
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:04,460
but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know it</font>

542
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">looks like it's it's likely to happen</font>

543
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:14,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay my clicker is not working pareil</font>

544
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:17,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that's kind of it's kind of a</font>

545
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:20,280
rundown on the 100 gig over the over the

546
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:23,790
win and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving into a bit about 100</font>

547
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,530
gig Ethernet transmission this is a I

548
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,530
through this diagram here because I like

549
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:29,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way it depicted how the</font>

550
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,320
packetization and you know works with

551
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,350
hundred gig Ethernet because it's quite

552
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,899
a bit different they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really had to they</font>

553
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,969
really had to exploit parallelism

554
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,580
throughout the design

555
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:44,060
and you see here we know the the

556
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:46,070
physical coding sublayer is really doing

557
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:49,280
some sonnet like functions where you

558
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:51,919
know it's providing the ability to to

559
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,280
give the r you know to avoid reordering

560
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:57,080
and skew of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wavelengths</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's</font>

561
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,770
adding very synchronous kinds of

562
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:03,800
concepts to ethernet to allow basically

563
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:05,720
allow you to use 10 gigabit components

564
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,909
and turn things<font color="#E5E5E5"> into smaller and smaller</font>

565
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,490
signals and reorder them all in a when

566
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,890
they come in on the receiver so and then

567
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:15,320
here's a little bit closer look at what

568
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:17,600
what the inside of for example 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> gig</font>

569
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">cfp looks like right and you have this</font>

570
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,429
thing you have the physical medium

571
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:23,840
attachment and then the important thing

572
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,870
here is this thing called the gearbox

573
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,280
the 10 to 40<font color="#E5E5E5"> year box this is one of the</font>

574
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,639

physical effects of what happens after

00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:11,060
these signals go down the fiber so on to

593
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,350
plug holes you know at one point in our

594
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:15,350
deployment we were faced with the

595
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:18,889
decision of do we do we go with<font color="#E5E5E5"> lr fours</font>

596
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:20,899
or what's called ten by ten ten by ten

597
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:25,790
are gaining popularity and in vendor

598
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:27,290
support you know we've we were unsure if

599
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:29,000
this was actually going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work out for</font>

600
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,590
us but what we eventually decided to go

601
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,679
with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ten by ten here that I</font>

602
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">have highlighted in the middle</font>

603
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:36,220
I'm sure you can probably guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

604
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:38,139
the major<font color="#CCCCCC"> factors where there was the</font>

605
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:41,529
two dollar signs compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the three</font>

606
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:44,799
dollar signs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so this this was a very</font>

607
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:46,090
very significant you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know amount of</font>

608
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,230
money when when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start multiplying</font>

609
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:52,269
things by by 52 or so or even you know

610
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,999
104 since you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> optics on the</font>

611
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:56,799
transponders and on the routers right so

612
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:59,379
so this ended up being a non-trivial

613
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,139
cost for us and we ended up deciding to

614
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:03,309
go with these these<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 by 10 optics even</font>

615
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:05,559
though they were they were not an i

616
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:08,168
triple e standard they had they had

617
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:10,509
significant industry support and we were

618
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:11,499
able to to work with our vendors to you

619
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:14,169
know make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these were going to</font>

620
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:17,350
work you know so one of the things that

621
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:19,899
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I elaborate on this a bit more</font>

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:22,090
later<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,029
any pluggable<font color="#CCCCCC"> xand you're in your gear</font>

625
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:26,860
that you already have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

626
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:28,330
work or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean some vendors are</font>

627
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,289
going to lock it down and you're not

628
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,639
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all and</font>

00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:31,570
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you're going to they're</font>

630
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:34,600
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to force you to buy their</font>

631
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:36,519
certified optics and some vendors will

632
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,980
you know it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> work but it might not be</font>

633
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:40,269
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same kinds of</font>

634
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:45,639
same kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of issues we've seen with</font>

635
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:47,950
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Monhegan 10 gig right so in terms</font>

636
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:51,279
of optical power these things are really

637
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:53,950
hot they<font color="#E5E5E5"> launch it like you know plus 13</font>

638
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,779
aggregate so you know one of the things

639
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,789
we we found interesting is you know we

640
00:24:55,779 --> 00:24:59,350
sometimes didn't even have power meters

641
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:01,059
that could they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could read that high</font>

642
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,070
right i mean you plug the thing in it

643
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:05,408
just as high right it just has no I you

644
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:08,590
know the power meter only goes to plus

645
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:11,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example and I guess some of the</font>

646
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:13,509
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we realized after starting</font>

647
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:15,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">to to look at these were that you know</font>

648
00:25:13,509 --> 00:25:17,080
you really can't test for compliance

649
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,299
unless you have an optical spectrum

650
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,549
analyzer if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to see the</font>

651
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:23,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">per Lane optical power across all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

653
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,909
thing is putting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fiber you really</font>

654
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,139
can't you know see what you know how

655
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:31,210
much difference there is between the

656
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:33,580
wavelengths for example or or if you

657
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,049
have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> cfp that's a little bit better</font>

658
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other right because you might</font>

659
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:38,500
have a

660
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:39,850
out of a pile of<font color="#CCCCCC"> CFP some might launch</font>

661
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,260
hotter on average and you might actually

662
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:43,209
get a little bit better performance out

663
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:47,110
of ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are actually launching a</font>

664
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:48,640
little hotter for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example in just a few</font>

665
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:51,399
other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've just sort of</font>

666
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,530
random notes here we've generally found

667
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,720
that with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten by tens we just like</font>

668
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:57,220
just plug them in you know they engineer

669
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,870
them nicely to be able to you know not

670
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,710
need any attenuators when you when you

671
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:04,178
plug them in<font color="#CCCCCC"> back-to-back for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

672
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:07,000
sr10 we really haven't had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole lot</font>

673
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:09,220
of experience with so we're you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

674
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,980
still looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at maybe using this in</font>

675
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:14,410
some locations for hooking up hosts

676
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:17,160
eventually or something like that but we

677
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:21,040
really standardized on on<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 by 10 or</font>

678
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:22,960
also known as el are<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 and you know</font>

679
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,178
that that's sort of really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only</font>

680
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,400
pluggable we've really done any thorough

681
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:29,350
testing out we've done some lr fours and

682
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:32,830
some limited cases but it's really

683
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:35,469
mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> c XPS look very</font>

684
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:37,330
interesting you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they claim to be</font>

685
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,880
there going to be interoperable with

686
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:41,770
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> CFPs in terms of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you can</font>

00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,299
plug<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fiber into a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cxp over here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

688
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:45,070
you can plug a fiber the other end of it

into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cfp and everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should work</font>

690
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:52,480
fine we have you know really have no

691
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:56,110
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> with CX peas yet but so</font>

692
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,760
anyway we're turning up our first

693
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,709
hundred gig circuit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> october of last</font>

694
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,360
year right and this is a this is a month

695
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,650
before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big conference where we have</font>

696
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,770
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hundred gig stuff</font>

697
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:07,480
working and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in you know things are</font>

698
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:09,549
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are great we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ping across this</font>

699
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">this our first hundred gig channel right</font>

700
00:27:09,549 --> 00:27:14,830
that's going almost across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

701
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:16,540
country which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very cool we have about</font>

702
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:18,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">forty days or so and you know we</font>

703
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually do want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually allow users</font>

704
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,960
to test this stuff before before we you

705
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,450
know before we actually have the show

706
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,950
and it was he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> great to be able to</font>

707
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,690
ping but we really wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

708
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:31,210
show that under load this thing still

709
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:33,070
performed well everything looked

710
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:35,410
perfectly fine for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transport system</font>

711
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:37,120
you know effect was not like you know

712
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:39,220
kicking in at all it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know</font>

713
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,320
showing showing everything looking very

714
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,760
clean but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just drive it at</font>

715
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,620
one hundred percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> utilization just to</font>

716
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,200
really make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure everything was was okay</font>

717
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,919
and and and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure zero drops do</font>

718
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,800
some some validation of

719
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,150
of qos and things like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font>

720
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,320
question became well well how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

721
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,910
going to how we going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> test this</font>

722
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,280
because we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any hundred kick</font>

723
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,810
test sets know where we're how are we

724
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,000
going to generate this much traffic

725
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:05,300
right and do we do we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy a</font>

726
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,360
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> big test box so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have all</font>

727
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:10,280
these 10 gigabit perfect testers already

728
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,709
deployed everywhere just basically hosts

729
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,270
that have 10 gig<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick's in them and so</font>

730
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:16,700
we decided well let's have some fun with

731
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:19,010
some routing loops so we can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you</font>

732
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,990
know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> persona our boxes what you know</font>

733
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:23,629
is that what the boxes are called it

734
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:25,910
have these 10 gig Nick's to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing</font>

735
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,430
routers on us net for we hooked up a

736
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:31,640
couple 10 gigs between es net for and an

737
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:34,100
A&I which will<font color="#CCCCCC"> BES</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 soon and we</font>

738
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:35,780
started basically creating some you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

739
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,850
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just throwing in some static</font>

740
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,520
routes and and started starting making

741
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:42,469
routing loops and we carefully chose

742
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,240
some TTL so the traffic would loop

743
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:47,060
exactly the right a number of times and

744
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,700
and voila we just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn on an</font>

745
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:52,220
i pref cannon and instantly we have

746
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,900
traffic looping 50 times around around

747
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network and we can actually see the</font>

748
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,280
the utilization go all the way up to

749
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,770
hundred percent so this was this this

750
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,330
gave us some you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know good feedback that</font>

751
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:04,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this is you know we're not getting</font>

752
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:06,020
any errors on the routers the transport

753
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:09,050
system still looks good you know where

754
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,250
we were pretty happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this so that</font>

755
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:11,870
was that was a quick way to just

756
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,550
saturate the link and just do some

757
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,929
sanity checks and we're really wondering

758
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:17,090
can we can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something a little bit</font>

759
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,800
more sophisticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually start</font>

760
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,169
counting packets and making sure we're

761
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,850
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not losing any so we started</font>

762
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:25,010
actually setting up policy-based routes

763
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:26,540
for policy based routing to do more

764
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:29,510
complex loops we're still doing

765
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:30,649
basically sending just UDP traffic but

766
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:32,570
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to the routers and</font>

767
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:34,250
essentially sticking in these these

768
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,679
policy based routing configs and

769
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:38,750
firewall<font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start counting back</font>

770
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,510
packets and and measure loss and

771
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:43,490
everything and and and this just whoops

772
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,950
right this this just worked out great

773
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,600
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we we fired this off and</font>

774
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,820
we were we were looping stuff around the

775
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,030
entire the entire network all across all

776
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:55,970
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> 700 gig channels that we brought</font>

777
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:57,379
up and and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know zero loss so</font>

778
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:59,510
that was that was really what we were

779
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,820
looking for and we're very very happy to

780
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,590
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then we you know going</font>

781
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:06,610
handed off to the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

782
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:08,350
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it so so that was that the</font>

783
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,330
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step was really to see well you</font>

784
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,830
know how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP perform on this thing</font>

785
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:13,299
right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is these are totally</font>

786
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:16,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">different totally different gear that</font>

787
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:19,389
we've not used to what we essentially

788
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,710
ended up configuring here it's unless

789
00:30:19,389 --> 00:30:23,320
you're familiar with this is might be a

790
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:26,200
little hard to see nurse gives on the

791
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,928
west coast near Oakland<font color="#E5E5E5"> California argon</font>

792
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:32,230
is in is near Chicago in the middle

793
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:35,649
there are basically are 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig links</font>

794
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:37,929
between chicago and california and what

795
00:30:35,649 --> 00:30:39,549
we what we had at each site is part of

796
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:41,590
that experimental test bed on a and I

797
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:43,450
that I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> you about we had a couple of</font>

798
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:45,519
hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are actually capable of each</font>

799
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,320
sourcing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> syncing 40 kick of traffic</font>

800
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,559
each so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the ability to actually</font>

801
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:53,139
generate 120 gig of traffic and sync 120

802
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,000
gig at either end so we started

803
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:57,729
basically configuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some vpls</font>

804
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,889
instances here and and basically firing

805
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:03,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff up and here you can basically</font>

806
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:05,439
see that out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 streams we were able</font>

807
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,120
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get basically 9.9 gig on on each</font>

808
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,460
stream the last couple were actually a

809
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,959
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower 9.4 those those hosts are</font>

810
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,100
actually was just slightly different

811
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,289
hardware rev that couldn't couldn't

812
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,759
quite do as well and at the very bottom

813
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:18,250
there on the on the router you could

814
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,200
actually see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the percentage</font>

815
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,690
utilization on the on 100 gig interface

816
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,159
was actually ninety-nine percent so this

817
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,200
was this gave us you know a good

818
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,929
confidence that the tcp / was going to

819
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,840
perform as well well as with<font color="#E5E5E5"> also which</font>

820
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:33,279
you know we had a lot of concerns about

821
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,970
well we did still find some<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues with</font>

822
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:39,009
this but I'll get into that in a bit so

823
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:41,559
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point we we had sort of learned</font>

824
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:42,730
a little bit about well you know there

825
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:45,220
were some certain things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were good</font>

826
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,960
about using host-based testers and then

827
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,120
we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> had access access to some</font>

828
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,649
hardware testers as well and that

829
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,539
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> proved to be very valuable</font>

830
00:31:50,649 --> 00:31:55,570
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are they are very good at</font>

831
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:59,169
it precisely controlling the packet

832
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:00,399
content they're very stable well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

833
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:03,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I should say that actually ended</font>

834
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,239
up not only stable but you can test you

835
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:07,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different things</font>

836
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,340
including things like reordering which

837
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,279
can be quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to actually test</font>

838
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,178
with with host-based testers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

839
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:14,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> read everything on this table</font>

840
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:15,469
but there

841
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:17,359
we just sort of started writing down

842
00:32:15,469 --> 00:32:19,700
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the advantages and disadvantages</font>

843
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:21,918
of hardware testers and and the host

844
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,929
based testers I they both were very

845
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,539
useful and they both have<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

846
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:27,919
advantages and disadvantages so you know

847
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:29,269
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found with the host based testers it</font>

848
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,639
was very nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually be able to</font>

849
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:33,259
fire up a real applications and<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

850
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:34,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing you know just to disk transfers</font>

851
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:36,589
and see how stuff is really going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

852
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:41,989
work when people hook up real real host

853
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:44,330
to this thing so so moving on you know

854
00:32:41,989 --> 00:32:45,709
the this you know I make this all sound

855
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">like if everything was just great and</font>

856
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:50,089
effing we've never had any problems but

857
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:51,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know obviously obviously we did and</font>

858
00:32:50,089 --> 00:32:53,658
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found ourselves basically</font>

859
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:55,998
tracking down<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost problems tracking</font>

860
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:58,159
down reordering and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

861
00:32:55,999 --> 00:33:01,099
trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

862
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,809
we were we were not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know acting</font>

863
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:04,879
alone we were actually had you know

864
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:07,539
customers who had routers that are other

865
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:09,559
vendors right and connecting to us and

866
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:11,690
connecting to other networks is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

867
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:13,279
using different gear right so we're sort

868
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,839
of connecting a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hundred</font>

869
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,899
gig stuff together that's all basically

870
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:19,489
brand new lots of different vendors you

871
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:22,488
know obviously we we had some issues

872
00:33:19,489 --> 00:33:24,469
here and there and and we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

873
00:33:22,489 --> 00:33:25,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">know tracking down losses is pretty easy</font>

874
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,799
as long as you have accurate counters

875
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:30,259
and and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's nice to be able to</font>

876
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:32,089
actually filter on a like an IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

877
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:33,379
or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and be able to to track</font>

878
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:35,809
down loss that way about counting

879
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:38,539
packets but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know when you have</font>

880
00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:40,908
background traffic and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that or you</font>

882
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:45,169
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite difficult to see if you know if</font>

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,629
I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I getting lost here or nowhere is</font>

884
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:49,849
this boss coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you know it's very</font>

885
00:33:47,629 --> 00:33:51,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">important obviously to know where all of</font>

00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:55,458
the drop counters are on your boxes I

887
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:57,979
mean you know is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting dropped you</font>

00:33:55,459 --> 00:33:59,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">know in some Q somewhere or where where</font>

is this where<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this loss happening</font>

890
00:33:59,629 --> 00:34:04,519
that I'm seeing so you know we spent a

891
00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:07,279
quite a good bit of time tweaking qos

892
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,899
and and all this to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

893
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:12,109
figure out how to get this all running

894
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:14,210
loss free tracking down reordering was

895
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:15,619
quite difficult you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know especially if</font>

896
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,960
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a hardware tester we</font>

897
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:20,179
found some ways to do this using hosts

898
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,010
but we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> liked using the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware</font>

899
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:24,690
testers for this

900
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:27,150
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've we were we were doing</font>

901
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:28,320
things like capturing packet traces and

902
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,360
you know all kinds of stuff and

903
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,250
analyzing these things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying trying</font>

00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">to figure this out so it was it turned</font>

out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know quite time consuming</font>

906
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:40,700
to do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> loop backs attended you know</font>

907
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:44,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sure many people have you know</font>

908
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:45,540
obviously learned the values of using

909
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,418
loop backs or debugging things like

910
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:50,190
sonnet circuits and you know we we found

911
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:52,109
that it was very helpful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to</font>

912
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,760
to verify patching and things like that

913
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:55,409
by going on to our transport gear

914
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,600
setting a facility loop facing the

915
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:59,190
router making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had linked come up</font>

916
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,170
on a port you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could we could</font>

917
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:03,270
quickly sanity check patching between

918
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:05,880
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the optical transport layer and</font>

919
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:08,280
the routers that way so so that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

920
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,960
helpful you could ping you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

921
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,790
basically send pings to a broadcast

922
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,400
address and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're not</font>

923
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're not getting lost there and well I</font>

924
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,250
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it was just very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful</font>

925
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,740
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to place loops in different</font>

00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:24,270
near end of a circuit or the far end you

930
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,470
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that we had to had</font>

931
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:34,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">to work out but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually we got this</font>

932
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:37,020
all all working quite well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a few</font>

933
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:40,050
notes on interoperability before we get

934
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:43,050
to the end here between between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

935
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:44,550
transport gear and the you know the

00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,590
layer 2<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in the optical transport</font>

937
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:48,900
year we really didn't see any issues i

938
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:51,060
mean the optical transport gear was just

939
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,680
you know bits went in bits came out it

940
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">was just you know it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just as</font>

941
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,759
transparent as you could ever hope but

942
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:58,500
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know should be right it was you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

943
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,200
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically no problems you know</font>

944
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:04,560
never had any<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues between you know</font>

945
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,990
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 gear and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> layer 23 gear and some</font>

946
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,020
other layer 23 year we had various you

947
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:11,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">know various different kinds of issues</font>

948
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:12,630
remember it's you know hundred geeks

949
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:14,400
still find new we're dealing with with

950
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,040
you know products that are better you

951
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,780
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just help the door vendors have</font>

952
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,940
chosen slightly different ways of

953
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,590
dealing with 100 gig and supporting

954
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,390
hundred gig in their platform so you

955
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:28,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">know it's really important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

956
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:30,029
exactly how how<font color="#CCCCCC"> how the flows go through</font>

957
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:31,630
your equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you know what is</font>

958
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:34,360
the interface on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back side</font>

959
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,680
you're 100 Gig linecard know how does it

960
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,930
interface to the backplane how does that

961
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,580
backplane interface to the switch fabric

962
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,730
you know or they can they actually

963
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:44,770
handle a single hundred gig flow or that

964
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:47,860
you know doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> different and</font>

965
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:49,390
an understanding you know understanding

966
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:51,550
what schemes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I use to basically</font>

967
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:53,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">internally load balance or something</font>

968
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:55,300
like that is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can all be very</font>

969
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:59,110
important in understanding how you how

970
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:00,610
to get good performance so you know we

971
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,010
basically found that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

972
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:04,960
the vendors were we're necessarily

973
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:07,960
optimizing for for one single line rate

974
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,610
flow and and so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely led</font>

975
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,850
to some challenges that<font color="#E5E5E5"> took some time</font>

976
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:15,100
to work out so with the with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten by</font>

977
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:17,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CFPs we we certainly had some</font>

978
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">concerns with interoperability you know</font>

979
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:21,790
we we certainly went into this is a bit

980
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">of an unknown as to whether or not you</font>

981
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,700
know this thing was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like the</font>

982
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:27,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten by ten and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it going to talk</font>

983
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:29,950
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this other thing after after</font>

984
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:32,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of testing through supercomputing</font>

985
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:35,080
and after we basically ended up

986
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:37,210
demonstrating basic interoperability and

987
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,590
by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just mean these</font>

988
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">things could pass packets they weren't</font>

989
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:42,190
always really happy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've stuck</font>

990
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:44,470
this this this piece of this pluggable

991
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:47,080
in there but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> things did you</font>

992
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,490
know package did flow and you know i'm

993
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to claim that your vendor is</font>

994
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:53,680
going to officially support this they

995
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:56,620
probably won't but but overall you know

996
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,759
we we found that you know in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

997
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,490
could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug these things in and they</font>

998
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,170
work quite well the support<font color="#E5E5E5"> for optical</font>

999
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:04,450
power monitoring you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the CLI is</font>

1000
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:06,730
varied quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean some some had</font>

1001
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:10,240
it some didn't some had perlane power

1002
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:13,480
some had only only aggregate power some

1003
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,009
had not be no nothing and also so that

1004
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,960
was you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it was a bit you know a</font>

1005
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:19,510
little disappointing but you know not

1006
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,790
not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big surprise and</font>

1007
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:24,130
fortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> over over short distances we</font>

1008
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:25,960
had no problems plugging in the the two

1009
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:27,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">kilometer versions of the 10 by 10 into</font>

1010
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:30,660
10 kilometer versions of the 10 by 10 so

1011
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:36,310
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> also good to good to find out</font>

1012
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:38,020
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a bit a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a this is</font>

1013
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,549
sort of a some details about what we

1014
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,980
what we did with those hundred gigs that

1015
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:44,049
we took up to supercomputing so in near

1016
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,199
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned we had 100</font>

1017
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:48,819
from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Salt Lake going up to seattle</font>

1018
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:52,209
and so one of the challenges here was

1019
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:54,429
that another another network canary in

1020
00:38:52,209 --> 00:38:57,999
in canada actually wanted to bring 100

1021
00:38:54,429 --> 00:38:59,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">channel in as well so we basically you</font>

1022
00:38:57,999 --> 00:39:02,049
know had to work very closely with the

1023
00:38:59,979 --> 00:39:03,308
sign it wide area network group to

1024
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:05,769
figure out how are we going to do this

1025
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:08,650
and so what we ended up here with is act

1026
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:10,660
you know the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual OE</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 00 conversion</font>

1027
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:13,869
really happened right on the show floor

1028
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:16,749
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade show and down in Salt Lake</font>

1029
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:18,549
City for our circuit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

1030
00:39:16,749 --> 00:39:20,319
we had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of regions so there were</font>

1031
00:39:18,549 --> 00:39:23,920
actually two regions required between

1032
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:26,229
salt lake and Seattle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is where</font>

1033
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">it gets kind of interesting so actually</font>

1034
00:39:26,229 --> 00:39:30,069
what once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to Seattle instead of</font>

1035
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,839
actually terminating the circuit there

1036
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:34,359
in the in the Western building at the

1037
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:37,029
pop we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually handed it</font>

1038
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:38,558
off to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the domain that's managed</font>

1039
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:41,380
by the the sign at landing here

1040
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:43,299
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> as alien waves so instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1041
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,459
handing them a hundred Giggy<font color="#CCCCCC"> client</font>

1042
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:47,920
signal we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> said okay here's</font>

1043
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:50,469
here's an OTU for right just just keep

1044
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,349
transporting this over to the you know

1045
00:39:50,469 --> 00:39:55,569
over to the show floor and so you know

1046
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:57,849
these these these boxes that were

1047
00:39:55,569 --> 00:40:00,069
between the westin building and the

1048
00:39:57,849 --> 00:40:02,410
trade show at the convention center

1049
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:04,058
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just taking an alien waves</font>

1050
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">just doing the power balancing and</font>

1051
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:07,119
pushing them across and they actually

1052
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:09,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't get converted back in 100 gig e</font>

1053
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,799
until<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got all the way to the to the</font>

1054
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:13,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">show floor so just a little little quick</font>

1055
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:15,699
case study there similarly something

1056
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:18,759
happened basically with the canary wave

1057
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:21,160
it came in from victoria<font color="#CCCCCC"> the university</font>

1058
00:40:18,759 --> 00:40:22,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">of victoria and came in is a again as an</font>

1059
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:26,578
alien wave into the westin building in

1060
00:40:22,689 --> 00:40:30,279
seattle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and went over as an alien wait</font>

1061
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:32,739
so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more or less it you</font>

1062
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:33,999
know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future we you know we still</font>

1063
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:35,650
have a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work to do obviously to</font>

1064
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:37,538
finish the<font color="#E5E5E5"> build to do the transition</font>

1065
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:40,239
some of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're interested</font>

1071
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:57,970
understand what the

doing that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be there are</font>

there is a reference here if<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you want</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think we're going to restrict</font>

1080
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:15,190
problems but but this is something we're

interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in looking at deploying</font>

colorless Road ohms is certainly

1083
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:21,760
hopefully on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the roadmap long-term</font>

1084
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,010
flexible grid if the you know if this

1085
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,859
concept ends up being commercially

1086
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:29,680
viable eventually we want to do terabit

1087
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:31,420
waves and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so just</font>

1088
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,609
finally before before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i end this i just</font>

1089
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:35,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to you know just acknowledge</font>

everyone who helped you know make this

1091
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:39,880
work possible there's a lot of some

<font color="#E5E5E5">people here in this room really helped</font>

make all this possible and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it certainly</font>

1094
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:45,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't have been possible to do all</font>

this without without the rest of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> es</font>

1099
00:41:54,670 --> 00:42:06,210
comments oh come on down everybody rush

00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:15,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">I will hungry from life and I was</font>

1101
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:19,220
interested in your comment about the 10

1102
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:21,769
x 10's are using the datacenter and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1103
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,328
wonder whether we if you think maybe

1104
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:25,249
would like to see greater failures of

1105
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:26,960
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> key clinks as a resolve them</font>

1106
00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:28,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">just simply using more fibers because I</font>

1107
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,019
mean a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the failures of linksys in</font>

1108
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:32,390
data centers is kind of like someone

1109
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:35,720
lent on the cave or<font color="#E5E5E5"> no the connector was</font>

1110
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:38,359
dirty isn't like that I wonder if<font color="#CCCCCC"> wonder</font>

1111
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:41,618
what that might increase right i mean i

1112
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:44,089
mean with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sr10 basically they have</font>

1113
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:45,739
my understanding is<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have like mpo</font>

1114
00:42:44,089 --> 00:42:48,049
connectors and you know you're basically

1115
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:49,220
going over multiple strands so if you're

1116
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:50,869
if you're doing something other than

1117
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,999
like rock to rock or within the same

1118
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:54,319
rack you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you certainly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

1119
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:56,149
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through patch panels</font>

1120
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,038
and actually break out all the fibers

1121
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:00,019
and try to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know have this</font>

1122
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:02,869
octopus cable going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through patch panels</font>

1123
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:04,279
and taking it somewhere else right so

1124
00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:05,690
yeah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know how that's</font>

1125
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:07,759
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to how that's going to pan out i</font>

1126
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:11,450
mean i would probably feel comfortable

1127
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:13,460
you know plugging a immuno mpo and to

1128
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:14,868
have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> MPO on both sides and being a</font>

1129
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,509
plug that right into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a server or</font>

1130
00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:19,609
something like that or a router<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1131
00:43:17,509 --> 00:43:20,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i could probably live with</font>

1132
00:43:19,609 --> 00:43:23,359
that you know from an operational

1133
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:25,069
perspective but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i certainly wouldn't</font>
