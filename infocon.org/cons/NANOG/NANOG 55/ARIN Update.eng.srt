forms now one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

61
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,940
kind of exciting for me this week was

62
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,230
actually hearing about some of the

63
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,329
things that's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the night to</font>

64
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,310
you and that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is brought forth to</font>

65
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,490
this community because it's important

66
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,190
for you all to understand the stresses

67
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,110
are going on not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only with v4 depletion</font>

68
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,660
but also with the governance issues and

69
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,300
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are important for for all</font>

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,940
of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin I socket and budget other</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ITU and seeing what they're doing as</font>

73
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,390
well as I can but it's important for all

74
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:30,590
of us to understand and to realize

75
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,570
implications of what changes could occur

76
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:37,200
before inventory this is how much we

77
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:39,480
have left 4.37 / 82 equivalents so we

78
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,260
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some addresses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left we also</font>

79
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,410
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4.82 / 16 equivalents of return</font>

80
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,899
space that will be reissued at some

81
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:52,280
point we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one / 10 Reserve</font>

82
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,410
that's used for dedicated v4 block for

83
00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:01,160
v6 deployment basically some sort of

84
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:06,630
matting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would assume here you see some</font>

85
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:09,750
first quarter of our 2012 v4<font color="#E5E5E5"> addressing</font>

86
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:11,579
assignments in terms of what's given out

87
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,380
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin and one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

88
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,450
kind of interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's we had spikes a</font>

89
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,829
little bit of ebbs and flows and it's

90
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,760
starting to rise<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're starting</font>

91
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:22,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see a little bit more demand for v4</font>

92
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,490
space a lot of this has to do with as

93
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,630
part of the before<font color="#CCCCCC"> run out plan is that</font>

94
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:31,630
you the window of<font color="#E5E5E5"> space that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font>

95
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:35,500
receive from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron changed and that is</font>

96
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually has changed drastically changed</font>

97
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,240
the amount of space that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron's given</font>

98
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:42,750
on as a result here you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see v6</font>

99
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,570
allocations and assignments fairly flat

100
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:49,510
so we had a spike right when the last /

101
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,849
states were given out to from iono to

102
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,110
the various regional registries but<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

103
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,900
there on out it really kind of

104
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:59,890
diminished in is kind of flatlined again

105
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:02,049
and here you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the lower</font>

106
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,120
4,000 subscribers that aaron has within

107
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,300
its region that you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

108
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:11,410
predominant majority of these only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

109
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,480
v4 space and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty-four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent or</font>

110
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,670
one-third actually have v4 and v6 we

111
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,830
certainly like to see that rise where

112
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:22,000
there's more people that actually start

113
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:24,310
using v6 as well so if you do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> v4</font>

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,490
and you want to have v6 now it's a good

115
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,770
time to get in we have a number of

116
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,810
policies coming out the door when is a

117
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,299
global policy for plastic post

118
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,790
exhaustion viewport allocation

119
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,340
mechanisms<font color="#CCCCCC"> diana and what this allows us</font>

120
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do is if we have a return</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> space we</font>

121
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,030
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in turn give it back Diana</font>

122
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,640
there was no policy in place to make

123
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,080
this happen before and I and I in turn

124
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:53,700
to give it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the regional</font>

125
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:56,530
registries we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of</font>

126
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">transfer sort of policies are going</font>

127
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,280
forth and John's going to talk more

128
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,750
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these we have inter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a are</font>

129
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,500
transfers going from region to region

130
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,510
there's a policy put in place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'd be</font>

131
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about that there's clarifying</font>

132
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:12,130
requirements for v4 transfers and one of

133
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:15,310
the things that it has is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

134
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:17,620
idea of you can't flip so if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> v4</font>

135
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:19,450
space and you turn go around and try to

136
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:24,780
sell<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the next day that that's just</font>

137
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:27,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a good thing and also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asn transfers</font>

138
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,859
here a bunch of a litany of proposals

139
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,650
are on the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now a lot of it</font>

140
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,449
sort of cleanup work on v 6 allocations

141
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:39,849
and a bunch of other things you can read

142
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:41,620
about as well now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

143
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,509
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the development efforts and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

144
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,860
is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of what's near dear to my</font>

145
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:46,240
heart what are the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

146
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,729
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do within</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron is doing a</font>

147
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,430
bunch of cost reduction sort of things

148
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:53,560
one of one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our bigger cost drivers is</font>

149
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,600
actually running oracle and we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

150
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">move it to postgres and that is</font>

151
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,860
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're actually have on</font>

152
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,289
the books and plan on doing we also use

153
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,050
Red Hat JBoss and we're moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> to jboss</font>

154
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:06,900
Community Edition which goes that also

155
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">is going to reduce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our licensing costs</font>

156
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,260
this is pretty substantial for us and we

157
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,449
look forward to actually doing this on

158
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,580
the jboss stuff is what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

159
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:17,830
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and we'll be rolling it out at</font>

160
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end of this month actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:29,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">to pay for stuff through air</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

164
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,340
not pleasant is it you have to remember

165
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:32,020
a bunch of things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't</font>

166
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,369
have to remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

167
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,380
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were also going to fix is</font>

168
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,770
that we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this seamless</font>

169
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,510
and and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is say something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

170
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,940
especially the billing department with

171
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:45,370
an errand would really like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see we've</font>

172
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,930
implemented a whois service and we have

173
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,810
a bunch of before run out tests that we

174
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,250
have to do so here's what i<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do I</font>

175
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,260
come on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Segway into two different</font>

things one is our<font color="#CCCCCC"> pic I and none of</font>

dis manipulate the data as you wish and

184
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:18,909
we generate a repository based on the

185
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,669
selections that you have made four rows

186

or whatever else the delegated model is

187
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:26,560
is different we're just actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed</font>

by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP keys are held by the ISP and</font>

certificate authority within it you have

191
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,640
to do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make that</font>

to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this themselves and they will</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually only hold the information that</font>

we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the hosted solution</font>

197
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,300

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:55,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that's actually made it</font>

199
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:58,060
difficult for us is we had to move<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

200
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,680
program programmable<font color="#E5E5E5"> hsm and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked</font>

201

<font color="#CCCCCC">about this before but this is just a</font>

202
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">really tedious work making these these</font>

203
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:09,370
programmable agent sums actually work in

00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:11,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">a very correct way once the hosted</font>

205
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,990
solution is deployed which we anticipate

206
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,290
be later this year we plan on then

207
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:19,240
moving on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the delegate solution we're</font>

208
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,670
also participating with the other

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,710
regional registries on a global trust

210
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:27,910
anchor what I can this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:29,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I I be with an ITF has asked for and</font>

212
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,959
we're actually going to implement as

213
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,760
well we're also participating with the

214
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,120
other regional registries now that we

215
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:41,950
have a global transfer process that we

216
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,950
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with so can you play</font>

217
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,510
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpki today yes we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">if you want so what I'm going to do is</font>

you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to walk you through</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the steps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can take to actually</font>

start playing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> us one is the first</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">part is actually registering with our</font>

pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> down a validator there's a number</font>

231
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,040
as an example here in a little bit and

232
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">you compare with the routes that you</font>

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,780
have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you received and see if</font>

234
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,900
they're validate or not so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

235
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:29,439
something you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> today so we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

236
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:32,800
this pilot since<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2009 it's an ER branded</font>

237

version of a ripe<font color="#CCCCCC"> NCC software it's not</font>

238
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,359
integrated with an errand online so once

239
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,800
the data is in there that I will

240
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,570
transfer from our registry database into

241
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,079
the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is what you'll be</font>

242
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:49,840
playing with and once you play with in

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> pilot that information they put in</font>

00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,260
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> those rows will not transfer</font>

245
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,820
into production when we do go into

246
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">production so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way of</font>

247
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:59,120
doing some experimentation we<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently</font>

248
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:02,029
have 55 Orton

249
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,060
Plus organizations participating I get a

250
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:07,339
couple every day and you can go ahead

251
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,709
and experiment now<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the things</font>

252
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:12,320
based on Randy's comment at the last

253
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:15,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">note nanog meeting as our trust anchor</font>

is now publicly available in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a in a more</font>

255
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,620
transparent manner and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can actually</font>

256
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:25,400
find it on that particular URL on the

257
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:28,820
aaron's website so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go ahead and</font>

258
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">request your your your account and you</font>

259
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:34,820
go to the pilot website you'll get user

260
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,680
an ID via<font color="#E5E5E5"> password I a user ID and</font>

261
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,420
password via email and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go ahead and</font>

262
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,660
load your resources in and at that point

263
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,920
you can start loading up your<font color="#E5E5E5"> rows at</font>

264
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,260
that point you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grab down a</font>

265
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,890
validator and the example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font>

266
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:51,770
use as ripes validator it's a very nice

267
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,390
turnkey sort of system that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

268
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,240
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to do at this point is</font>

269
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:59,870
go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a preview so you pull it up</font>

270
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,339
it brings up a basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> JBoss</font>

271
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:05,959
instance running on your local machine

272
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:07,850
on port 8080 and this is when you first

273
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:09,319
come in this was what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see and you</font>

274
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,850
can play around with a little bit and

275
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,140
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see is it</font>

276
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:16,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually pulls it in a bunch of</font>

00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:19,279
information through ripes<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrist system</font>

278
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,350
right information system and you can

279
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,959
actually see a bunch of routes that

280
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,480
that's within their system and you can

281
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:28,459
see well you really can't see whether or

282
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">not it's valid or not if you pull it</font>

283
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:33,829
down you'll be able to see if it's a

284
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:35,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit too coarse on the screen what</font>

285
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,120
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also do is you can also see the</font>

286
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:41,239
validated row us that have been put in

287
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,860
per region for example within errands

288
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:46,160
region there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred rows</font>

289
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:48,170
that have been transferred<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are you</font>

290
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,819
can see through the validator that are

291
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,010
part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pilot and all these things</font>

292
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:54,650
are all integrated and packaged within

293
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:56,600
ripes validator system all you have to

294
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,939
do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go ahead and load it up and</font>

295
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,950
it actually does all the magic for you

296
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:05,720
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually start seeing this</font>

297
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:08,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to now I</font>

298
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:11,060
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on to who is our WS what</font>

299
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:12,460
this is is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> has really started the</font>

00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,079
weirds effort with a night

301
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,720
that Tom talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a little bit</font>

302
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,300
earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've had a pretty good run on</font>

303
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,630
on traffic we've had multiple highs with

304
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:25,349
in 2010-2011 right now we're running

305
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:28,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">about 475 queries per second which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

306
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:30,700
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> number but when they're one of the</font>

307
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:33,640
interesting things is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the restful</font>

308
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,580
calls that we have have overtaken port

309
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,170
43 calls and it's by substantial margin

310
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,880
now I'm going to have a graph about this

311
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:43,449
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit later but it's pretty cool</font>

312
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,670
to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this old antiquity did who</font>

313
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:49,090
is directory service is now being

314
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:53,349
supplanted by a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> and cool system that</font>

315
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:57,250
all engineers like to use so here you

316
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:59,770
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> our graphs on port 43 here you</font>

317
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,350
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see our graphs on dealing with who</font>

318
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,569
is our WSMV<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting is</font>

319
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:08,710
we're now getting close to one percent

320
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:10,180
of our total traffic coming across v6 so

321
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:17,350
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say we're part of that one</font>

322
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:19,900
percent and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned a little bit</font>

323
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,880
earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 443 that's this crusty</font>

324
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,650
crusty system that we had which is

325
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,620
firmly established and everybody has a

326
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:30,370
whois client that<font color="#CCCCCC"> talksport 43 is now</font>

327
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:32,920
being supplanted by by by restful calls

328
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,290
and here's the graph that shows it and

329
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,750
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the green is the total</font>

330
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,490
number the orange is the restful calls

331
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,620
and over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last couple of months is</font>

332
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,440
overtaking what's actually seeing on 443

333
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,500
so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to me this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

334
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:52,630
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool to see having a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> core service</font>

335
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:54,280
being replaced by a newer service here's

336
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:58,090
where upcoming meetings are we have one

337
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,319
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dallas and given from the picture it</font>

338
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:03,580
looks like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a warm and</font>

339
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,830
sunny place in the spring of 2013 so we

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,860
go on and what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen next</font>
