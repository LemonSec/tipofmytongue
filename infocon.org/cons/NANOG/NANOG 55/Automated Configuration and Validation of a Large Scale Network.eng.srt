00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,700
content we had is fantastic we closed it

21
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:43,379
out with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the peering track you know</font>

thanks very much everyone who

24
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:50,340
and split out in the tracks today the

25
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:54,000
track we have is DNS after the close of

26
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,459
the plenary one thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:00,420
discussion guidelines as a little hairy

00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,849
there for a little while<font color="#CCCCCC"> yesterday</font>

30
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,470
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> could just recognize that the</font>

00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:06,720
speakers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that come up here doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this on</font>

32
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,449
their own time and in some cases on

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,008
their own dime and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember to</font>

the audience it's just greatly

36
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:18,930
appreciated it causes less friction

41
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:43,880
automated configuration validation of a

42
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:43,880
large-scale network DJ is ambling up now

43
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:51,359
you need four minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk four</font>

44

minutes early your calendar does not

me try<font color="#E5E5E5"> this out pointer works how do you</font>

54
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:40,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">go for here we go next back excellent so</font>

55
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,600
hi I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vijay kill I work for Microsoft</font>

56
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,179
and we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about automated</font>

57
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,790
configuration management today this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

58
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,110
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large topic and this involves a</font>

59
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:54,328
cast of hundreds although the primary

60
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:57,750
author of the work is actually mr.

61
00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:00,660
Schmidt on my right so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

62
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,400
motivation everybody knows sorry for the

63
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,510
eye chart it looked a lot better on the

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:11,400
84-inch<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows tablet I do my work on</font>

65
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:14,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">my bad so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the need for</font>

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,410
configuration management there's a

67
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,769
fairly widespread audience here how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

68
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:24,900
people here run or operate networks or

69
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:29,039
other large automated systems for

70
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:33,210
network operators these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as many</font>

71
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:36,349
hands as as I would prefer to see so

72
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,349
what do the rest of you guys do

73
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:45,730
drink<font color="#CCCCCC"> lovely let me try this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again how</font>

74
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,830
many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here don't run either</font>

75
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:52,600
networks or other automated or other

76
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:54,669
systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> at scale like this like do hands</font>

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,110
up so there's a discrepancy here

78
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,310
somewhere either you guys are still

79
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,310
asleep or you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying attention</font>

80
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:08,590
anyway so for the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm having is</font>

81
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,719
I'm having a hard time reading what's on

82
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,690
the on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitors here good thing I've</font>

83
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,400
memorized entire thing one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

84
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:19,420
everybody knows is there's a network

85
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,870
skills you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that the</font>

86
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:25,930
supporting systems scale sub linearly

87
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:28,960
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean on average in the g8 and</font>

88
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:32,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at a loaded FD cost of</font>

89
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,380
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> five to four per million dollars</font>

90
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:37,960
of GNA right so as you increase your

91
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:41,050
network size and having your

92
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,750
organization scale linearly your your

93
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:48,670
cogs<font color="#E5E5E5"> Also Rises everybody here knows</font>

94
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:50,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">what cogs is Right see OGS cogs is cost</font>

95
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:54,130
of goods sold it's a large metric it

96
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:56,260
determines gross margin and a net profit

97
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:59,230
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all here to somehow make a</font>

98
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,510
profit except for some were non profit

99
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,490
but point being<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want cogs to</font>

100
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,670
grow linearly with your service you want

101
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:09,880
cogs to ideally or portions of cogs to

102
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:12,760
track sub linearly with your scale units

103
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:17,219
and as a result putting more people to

104
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,219
do more work is a losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposition</font>

105
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,780
many many reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> for configuration</font>

106
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,390
management one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them is scaling the</font>

107
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:28,090
second one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it makes it makes it</font>

108
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:29,770
easier to<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason about what it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

109
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">are doing and i'll go into stats on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

110
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,020
next slide and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it</font>

111
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:38,320
enforces standards and it reduces

112
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:40,930
complexity and one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does</font>

113
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,730
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important for us as a</font>

114
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:48,040
service provider is that it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

115
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,000
standardize the network and stand with

116
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,010
standardized

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,630
you can get to scale and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

118
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,330
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people keep</font>

119
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:59,380
documentation in a wiki or a SharePoint

120
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:03,219
of course SharePoint or<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of</font>

121
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:07,570
other documentation management tool I

122
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,920
see 35 about oh wow because you know

123
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,540
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> my next question is how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many people</font>

124
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,560
here don't keep their documentation

125
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:18,130
around and nobody raises their hand

126
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,660
shame on you the point is as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

127
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,120
put any documentation or any

128
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,610
configuration management or any process

129
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,970
in a document management system like a

130
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:31,390
wiki or a SharePoint or JIRA or whatever

131
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,400
it is it is obsolete it is obsolete as

132
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:36,270
soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you hit enter and click on</font>

133
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:40,210
submit or save or save to SharePoint

134
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:42,190
it's done it's obsolete so one of the

135
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:45,039
things configuration management allows

136
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:49,060
us to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it keeps your documentation</font>

137
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,650
as code code is<font color="#E5E5E5"> documentation and this</font>

138
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,690
is applicable<font color="#E5E5E5"> for process it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

139
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:55,330
applicable<font color="#E5E5E5"> for configuration it is</font>

140
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:57,010
applicable for standards so therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

141
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:00,099
you change a standard and you change the

142
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:02,380
code it pushes it out there's no lag

143
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:05,169
between what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing and what your</font>

144
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:08,669
documentation looks like how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people</font>

145
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:10,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">here love to document stuff they do</font>

146
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:22,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright at least this time we are being</font>

147
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:24,520
honest here exactly well played sir well

148
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,550
played well played Patrick well played

149
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:31,330
the point here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if documentation</font>

150
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:33,400
is code then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no discrepancy</font>

151
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,468
between updating your documentation and

152
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,059
updating a code because there are two

153
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:38,830
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> people hate updating</font>

154
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:41,949
documentation for the most part as you

155
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:46,270
all are tested and second is any time

156
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:49,110
you type stuff in twice there is a entry

157
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:53,339
point for errors for configuration miss

158
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:58,320
for typos for configuration creep so and

159
00:08:53,339 --> 00:09:00,470
humans make mistakes even engineers

160
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:10,110
and of course since we are better humans

161
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:12,000
we that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually this entire</font>

162
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:15,090
talk is a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me to show this</font>

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,800
picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I mean one does think</font>

164
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,650
like civil engineers constructing

165
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,260
bridges are very rigorous because

166
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,240
people's lives are at stake here they

167
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,450
tend to have very large amounts of

168
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,310
program management budgets and of course

169
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,230
all the ancillary equipment that goes

170
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,150
around with building a large seabridge

171
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,820
you would figure that they of all people

172
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:40,590
would get this right but<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously not</font>

173
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:42,240
so much so moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so here are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

174
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,670
the stats this is why I said it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

175
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,130
easier for for me to show you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

176
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,920
we can talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to reason or think</font>

177
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:53,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how do we operate on this entity</font>

178
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,310
the key part here is there about 77 280

179
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,959
device<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolls we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know for sure</font>

180
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,939
because they keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing around and</font>

181
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:04,230
not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> documented in our</font>

182
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:06,930
share points this tens of thousands of

183
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:10,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">networked devices number is very large I</font>

184
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:12,060
see a bunch of Microsoft people here you

185
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:15,290
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how how big that is and how chaotic</font>

186
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:18,479
but I should have said that inside voice

187
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:21,120
there are 30 million lines of config

188
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,040
approximately<font color="#CCCCCC"> so now if you look at the</font>

189
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,300
reasoning about 30 million lines of

190
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:30,959
config that's one config line it's about

191
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:34,170
57 config lines a minute so what

192
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,150
approximately 1 config line is second so

193
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:39,240
trying to reason about something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

194
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:42,150
large is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just completely not viable</font>

195
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,180
by manual or human processing or

196
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:49,040
scanning right on the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand if we</font>

197
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:49,040
have a generating function and that

198
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,540
encapsulate sand generates 30 million

199
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:58,050
lines of config that generating function

200
00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:00,780
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be 10,000 lines of code or five</font>

201
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:03,060
thousand lines of code and we can reason

202
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:05,970
and think and analyze and check for

203
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:09,030
correctness<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten to fifteen two hundred</font>

204
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:11,370
thousand lines of code which is multiple

205
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:14,699
orders of magnitude less than the output

206
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:18,770
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> core generates so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore from a</font>

inspection validation and testing

208
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:23,160
purposes having automation that can

209
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,740
generate 30 line 30 million lines of

210
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,529
config is much easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get right to</font>

211
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:31,200
reason about and think than to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

212
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:32,490
the actual raw information that it is

213
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,850
generated through that generating

214
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:40,830
function so that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> good and well but</font>

215
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,230
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> net-net people don't care whether</font>

216
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:45,450
what my cogs looks like as long as they

217
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:48,690
get their service at a cheap or

218
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:50,250
acceptable price so in the net all we

219
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,920
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is make sure that</font>

220
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is actually resulting</font>

221
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,110
in good service management because

222
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,800
customers care about reliability data

223
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:04,710
loss and so reasoning about how to give

224
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,449
them that using<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a large system and we</font>

225
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:09,420
are working on large systems now there's

226
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:12,710
no longer like networks or computers or

227
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:17,760
data centers it's all one integrated

228
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:20,700
system it requires very rigorous service

229
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,770
management it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to reduce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> costs</font>

230
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,680
already talked about cogs on an<font color="#CCCCCC"> SG&A</font>

231
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:27,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">perspective it's great for users it</font>

232
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,939
gives them reliable service without

233
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,380
manually triggered outages although if

234
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,020
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been reading the press lately we</font>

235
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,660
are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite I think as an industry</font>

236
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,209
where we need to be and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proofs</font>

237
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,980
time-to-market you can't reason about 70

238
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:42,479
million lines of code or 30 million

239
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,670
lines of code<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then make changes</font>

240
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,080
operational transforms<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get you from</font>

241
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:48,180
one service offering to another service

242
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,730
offering but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can reason about code</font>

243
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,199
that takes that operationally transforms

244
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,240
this service offering with that 30

245
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,100
million lines of code to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font>

246
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,680
offering with that 30 million line of

247
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,230
code because here you're operating on

248
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,510
10,000 lines of code I can understand

249
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:06,180
10,000 lines of code I can understand 30

250
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:08,490
million lines of config at least I can't

251
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:13,890
most people here I guess can but that's

252
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:17,070
why you're smarter than I am so how did

253
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:19,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do this well when I say we I mean</font>

254
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,480
David did<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I'm only the mouthpiece</font>

255
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,069
work and credit should be given to David

256
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,550
and one of the people here who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

257
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:29,410
writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug-in scripts and David</font>

258
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:32,439
how that's implemented so one of the

259
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,540
things we did was I set a principle out

260
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,350
that in two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years there should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

261
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:42,160
human touch on the network except<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

262
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:43,630
very urgent break fix and having that as

263
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,969
an operating principle or an overriding

264
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,529
goal then allows us to work back and

265
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,540
like reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how do we get from</font>

266
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:53,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">where we are today to where we want to</font>

267
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:55,510
be and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft like like our</font>

268
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:00,010
friends is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Edward here Edward Edward</font>

crab here<font color="#E5E5E5"> he is much like our as Edward</font>

270
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,329
gave in his talk yesterday and there are

271
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,860
two networks one is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

272
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:10,120
backbone and then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the data</font>

273
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:11,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">center to data center backbone and one</font>

274
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,670
of the goals we set up for the data

275
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,290
center backbone was that it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

276
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,479
entirely hundred percent automated and

277
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,660
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> David will go into more examples</font>

278
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,820
there and it's inspired by<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

279
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:25,600
programs on Microsoft if you bring for

280
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:28,990
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> auto pilot Microsoft the first hit is</font>

281
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,850
a paper by microsoft research that talks

282
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,190
about out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the autopilot fabric</font>

00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:43,839
for that which is pretty open<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess in</font>

287
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,640
the industry so we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to move</font>

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,540
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that was trying to point a</font>

292
00:14:54,070 --> 00:15:00,040
point out here is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are now at a</font>

293
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:02,529
scale where we humanly can't do do this

294
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,839
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible on a manual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> inspection</font>

295
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:07,270
or manual work to actually get to where

296
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:10,329
we need to be there are services here at

297
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,800
Microsoft that don't don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> boot up short</font>

298
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:14,040
of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty thirty thousand servers</font>

299
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,449
at a time that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the minimum</font>

300
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,930
footprint for the service<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

301
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:23,459
I can't at least I don't know anybody

302
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:27,579
else who can manually configure any

303
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:29,469
element that takes care of like 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 50</font>

304
00:15:27,579 --> 00:15:33,489
thousand hundred thousand hosts at a

305
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:34,390
time it's just too<font color="#CCCCCC"> large to do by by</font>

306
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,920
hand

307
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,290
and of course one of the problems is

308
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,229
that at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that scale you are constantly</font>

309
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:43,719
broken failure is rampant at all points

310
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:47,800
just by the law of large numbers and so

311
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,240
therefore as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you at that scale there's</font>

312
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,359
so much failure that if you have to

313
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,010
manually remediate that failure you

314
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,350
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 10,000 people just</font>

315
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,569
sitting there like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 people per door to</font>

316
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,490
figure out what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong I see</font>

317
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:04,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dylan is here he's like I do that we</font>

318
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:05,470
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop lying but you see where I'm</font>

319
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:07,870
going with this just just think about

320
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,340
the numbers and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course it follows the</font>

321
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:13,270
light rod management principle which is

322
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:16,260
to reduce<font color="#CCCCCC"> SGA so here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are some of the</font>

323
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:20,079
stats we've seen so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first set is</font>

324
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:22,660
about a year ago it took us about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two to</font>

325
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,120
three days to roll out the router after

326
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,740
the the automation was in place it's

327
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,010
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 seconds and most of that is</font>

328
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,690

<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two to three engineers to do peer</font>

your credentials in and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course even</font>

335
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,840
our engineers were making ten to fifteen

percent error rate compared to base

337
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,430

checking what was bounced back through

<font color="#E5E5E5">Bill of wrongs after automation there</font>

345
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:17,949
are 0 because well you either code it in

00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:21,400
the documentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need</font>

352
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,480
process and human inspection we could

353
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,399
push about 50 changes on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,260
with that

360
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:53,440

00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:55,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of shows the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amount</font>

362

of goodness that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> managed to leverage</font>

363
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,280
and to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are certain</font>

364
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,320
principles that we adhere to when

365
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,060
designing the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the first</font>

366
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,480
principle is deployment is declarative

367
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:09,730
you declare what the state that the

368
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,760
desired state is and then the

369
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:16,150
operational transforms looks at desired

370
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:18,340
state current<font color="#E5E5E5"> state and does a minimally</font>

371
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:20,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">invasive set of procedures that takes it</font>

372
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:24,070
from current state to desired state so

373
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:27,479
it's decorative deployment I already

374
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:30,129
said we had a principle that said<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

375
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,920
human changes on the network and by

376
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:34,810
decorative in programming we can we can

377
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,820
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that that happens and there</font>

378
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:39,310
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be never any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end-user downtime</font>

379
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,830
during deployments that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

380

381
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:47,199
our friendly bug filled routers even

with the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> rigorous testing some</font>

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,210
still escape in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the field so we would</font>

384

like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be there but in some cases we</font>

385
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,740
are not but we are minimizing those and

386
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:01,090
we are a lot less than when we were

388
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:05,290
is that we can now repair automatically

389
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:07,690
I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it a little bit at the</font>

indistinguishable<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a host failure</font>

422
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:36,889
because the unreachable hosted an

perspective sometimes you do it's hard

434
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,580
to distinguish between hard down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

435
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:09,490
soft corruption so on and so forth but

436
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,750
for the vast majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases an</font>

437
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,909
application looks at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> network failure</font>

438
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,860
as a host failure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that allows it to</font>

439
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:18,350
mitigate the service away by moving it

440
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,969
to a different set of hosts and then you

441
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,158
can kick off your<font color="#E5E5E5"> repair process at</font>

442
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,669
leisure so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> allows you for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

443
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,899
to move away from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> four-hour</font>

444
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:30,799
replacement window which is very

445
00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:32,750
expensive to maybe one week replacement

446
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">window which is significantly cheaper</font>

447
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,639
from a MN our perspective nmn are of

448
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:43,760
course is directly flowing through<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

450
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem and you can alarm a problem you</font>

451
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:51,169
know something is<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong and since we are</font>

452
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,820
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a declarative policy system if you</font>

453
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:55,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what is wrong you know what what</font>

454
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,320
you need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so repair</font>

455
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,850
becomes the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as alarming or alarming</font>

456
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,309
becomes the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> as repair or vice versa</font>

457
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,719
again there are some nuances here that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

458
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:04,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">because of time I'm not going to go into</font>

460
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,740
outside but for the high level you can

461
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:12,049
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of alarming and repair as two</font>

462
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:14,249
sides of the same coin in a declarative

463
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:18,009
system

464
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:22,419
and of course software development

465
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:24,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">lifecycle Microsoft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a software</font>

472
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:46,839
anymore I'm looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hire software</font>

473
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:50,379
engineers because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is now in all</font>

474
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:52,989
ways and forms a software system it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:55,509

477
00:22:55,509 --> 00:23:00,879
reason about systems and programs and

478
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:04,690
code and unit tests and we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

479
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:06,309
that in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide this is an area</font>

480
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,950
where there is still a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of room we</font>

481
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:12,129
have to do work on so again like I said

482
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:14,529
it is easy for us to reason about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000</font>

483
00:23:12,129 --> 00:23:16,599
lines of code versus 30 million lines of

484
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:19,960
config right you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it but</font>

485
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:23,289
still people<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mistakes errors come</font>

486
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,659
in data quality issues transposition of

487
00:23:23,289 --> 00:23:29,219
IP addresses so one of the things that

488
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:31,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working on now is we can test and</font>

489
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:34,479
validate the program the<font color="#E5E5E5"> generating</font>

490
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:36,460
functions that generator config but

491
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:38,019
there's also another software test

492
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,369
system and<font color="#CCCCCC"> David will go into that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

493
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:42,489
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> in his portion of the talk</font>

494
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:45,699
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are looking at how do we unit</font>

495
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:48,429
test two things unit<font color="#E5E5E5"> test the output of</font>

496
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:52,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">the programs and then you unit test the</font>

497
00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:55,119
program's themselves so an example we

498
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:58,479
have a router which needs a loopback

499
00:23:55,119 --> 00:24:00,158
address so you run a unit test on the on

500
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:02,619
the module that generates the loopback

501
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,440
config but one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

502
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:08,049
can do is that we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the loopback</font>

503
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,229
address should have two properties first

504
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:13,179
property is that it should come from a

505
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:17,349
assigned block of Lubeck addresses so

506
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:20,710
you run a / 32 or a / 128 match against

507
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:22,960
the reserved block of Lubeck addresses

508
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,159
and see if it fits into that the second

509
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">property is that it should not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

510
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,049
assigned elsewhere on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network right</font>

511
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:31,690
and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is again easy to test</font>

512
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:35,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">for you run a grep or you run some sort</font>

513
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:37,779
of other check against what's already in

514
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:40,359
the network and see if both those

515
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:42,909
properties hold true if<font color="#E5E5E5"> those both those</font>

516
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:45,189
properties hold true it is much safer to

517
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:46,659
push out that config and know at least

518
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,879
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are not going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bollix</font>

519
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:51,070
something majorly up because the worst

520
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:53,109
case is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we assign a loopback</font>

521
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:55,059
address that is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the far side or on</font>

522
00:24:53,109 --> 00:24:56,619
the near side when it shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be but</font>

523
00:24:55,059 --> 00:25:00,849
we know that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to conflict</font>

524
00:24:56,619 --> 00:25:02,709
and cause is is week Alex and we know

525
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:06,039
that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to blow up an ACL</font>

526
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:07,539
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the ACLS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lubeck</font>

527
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:10,179
addresses should be denied or whatever

528
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:12,099
it is the policy is for they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> also we</font>

529
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:14,320
feel that within the guard rails of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

530

532
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:24,339
into the network and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's an area we</font>

533

<font color="#CCCCCC">are still working on we know what the</font>

end state looks like an undescribed it

535
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:30,809
we are not fully there yet in interest

536

of full disclosure but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again just</font>

reducing the entire configuration to

generating functions that are several

thousand lines in code allows us to be

540
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:43,329
much more manually rigorous in

major why automation and of course one

544
00:25:51,579 --> 00:25:54,999
of the last principles is

545
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:56,499
standardization by definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

hundreds of thousands of lines of code

549
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:06,369
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have standardized and</font>

550
00:26:03,879 --> 00:26:08,079
standardization because you need a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

551
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:09,459
few elements because you can reason and

552
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,158
think about those three elements and

553
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,229
then replicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee apply them it's like</font>

a fractals most people here are familiar

00:26:14,229 --> 00:26:19,059
with fractals the generating function

556
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:21,309
for fractals are like in some cases a

562

610

658
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:16,600
I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier the libraries are</font>

00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:19,600
very important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep the scripts</font>

661
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,689
about 60 lines long this again allows

662
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:29,289
non scripters to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go in there</font>

663
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:35,409
and tweak them when a change is

664
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:37,119
necessary this is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example workflow so</font>

665
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:41,919
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example we have a device</font>

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,109
monitored by individual scripts for

668
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:50,080
example the interfaces there is a

669
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:52,869
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and based on the user option</font>

670
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,220
there's a report or repair action and

671
00:31:52,869 --> 00:32:01,840
the repair goes back and fixes the

672
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:03,789
incorrect item conditions and then as I

673
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,668
mentioned earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is very important</font>

674
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:09,850
we have various pattern matching

675
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:12,629
auditing tools today they unfortunately

676
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:16,168
generate a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of false positives due to</font>

677
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:19,059
the inflexibility of the pattern match

678
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:21,669
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes many ways of doing</font>

679
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:26,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pattern match can be</font>

680
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:29,619
very rigid at times so the example here

681
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:32,738
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to prefix lists at first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> glance</font>

682
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:35,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">they do not match however under the</font>

683
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:37,809
loose match rules everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

684
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:41,908
accounted<font color="#E5E5E5"> for and this particular</font>

685
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:44,739
configuration would pass however under

686
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:46,659
strict rules there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one line in</font>

687
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:50,769
particular that does not belong and

688
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:53,859
should be removed and then finally we

689
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:56,289
have strict order which requires the

690
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:59,230
expected configuration to exactly match

691
00:32:56,289 --> 00:33:02,080
line by line in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the actual</font>

692
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:04,539
configuration and the remediation would

693
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:09,689
be to remove the prefix list entirely

694
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:09,690
and readd it in the expected order

695
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:14,350
dependencies since we broke down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

696
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,330
configs into very small pieces

697
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:19,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">oftentimes there's one script that</font>

698
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:21,350
monitors one part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the config while</font>

699
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:25,519
there's another piece of config

700
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:27,740
somewhere else that is perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken</font>

701
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:31,210
and one script is unaware of the other

702
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:34,490
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> built in a way for scripts to</font>

703
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:38,019
recursively check other scripts to see

704
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:41,630
that other components are also passing

705
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:44,899
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> example I gave a peer group has</font>

706
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:47,059
dependencies on EGP policies BGP

707
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:51,500
policies have dependencies on prefix

708
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:53,658
lists and AAS paths so if there was an

709
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:57,080
issue in the ass path for example the

710
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:59,330
peer group<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I ran it would run it</font>

711
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:04,039

713
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:09,469

716
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:20,750
earlier advert on an average script ran

717
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:23,839
about 60 lines we found across<font color="#E5E5E5"> those 230</font>

718
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:28,550
scripts about 4,000 different variations

that we needed to remediate some of

720
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:35,629
these variations were very simple

721

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:49,399
earlier challenges so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

725
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,970
challenges is different vendors and how

726
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:54,799
their configurations are formatted how

727
00:34:51,969 --> 00:35:00,259
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> behavior of the router is when you</font>

728
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:03,380
make a change<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can move from with one</font>

729
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:05,150
vendor loading a config<font color="#E5E5E5"> and saving it</font>

00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,760
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're okay whereas another vendor</font>

731
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:11,599
removing a prefix list for example might

732
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a problem and we adding it may have a</font>

733
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,680
brief period where there's there's

734
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:18,710
issues on the router we're looking into

736
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:23,359
we're not quite there

737
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:27,440
at during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> initial cleanup we found</font>

738
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:29,779
we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of research</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into why</font>

739
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,230
things are simply going from the current

740
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,780
running state to the standard state was

741
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:39,950
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always the best choice doing so</font>

742
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:42,430
could lead to outages so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cleanup</font>

743
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:48,290
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> was was time consuming and and</font>

744
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:50,629
difficult scripts can conflict with each

745
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:52,670
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> so for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example if you have two</font>

746

scripts that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> both looking at the</font>

00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:57,890

00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:00,380
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> different they can both or one</font>

00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:04,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">or the other fail so you need to be</font>

750
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:09,200
careful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to limit how the scripts are</font>

751
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:11,480
monitoring your configurations and then

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">finally strip coverage is really</font>

753
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,150
important to achieve maximum benefit for

754
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:20,270
example if you only are<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitoring half</font>

755
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:22,760
of your configuration how do you know if

756
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:25,009
there's croft lingering in your other

757
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,839
half of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your configuration so by</font>

758
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:29,420
covering the entire code you can quickly

759
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:34,849
identify what doesn't belong and what is

760
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:37,280
left out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the framework as far as</font>

other use cases we use it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a config</font>

generator with just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few variable</font>

763
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:45,950
inputs we can generate a baseline

764
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:47,950
template for a new router as Vijay

765
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:51,470
mentioned it takes<font color="#CCCCCC"> just seconds to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

766
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:55,490
and has greatly diminished the number of

767
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:57,859
errors in new router deployments we also

768
00:36:55,490 --> 00:37:00,729
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the framework the same libraries</font>

769
00:36:57,859 --> 00:37:04,220
to do incremental changes for example

770
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:08,180
new peering sessions new interface

771
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:11,660
turnips are tailored so that they take

772
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:13,520
user input and the user input creates an

773
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,710
expected config compares it against the

774
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,509
router fails generates the the

775
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:20,810
remediation and we push<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out to the</font>

776
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:22,990
routers thank you are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

777
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions</font>

778
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:38,680
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so obviously you know these are</font>

779
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:42,339
networks sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> name it really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hydra</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crab</font>

780
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,890
Google these are networks these devices

781
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:47,519
interact and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have</font>

782
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:50,439
changes that encompass multiple devices

783
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:52,569
do some transactional semantics to take

784
00:37:50,439 --> 00:37:54,759
care of partial config changes across

785
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:56,949
the network that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually related to</font>

786
00:37:54,759 --> 00:38:00,099
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other do you just roll back all of</font>

787
00:37:56,949 --> 00:38:01,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">them and then how do you deal with the</font>

788
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:03,849
different levels of push that you may

789
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:09,039
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgiven transaction across</font>

790
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:13,299
multiple devices I can't get it so one

791
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:16,119
example was updating a md5 password on

792
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:18,640
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp sessions obviously you have to</font>

793
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:21,219
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> password on both sides so</font>

794
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,839
if you have one router updated the

795
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:25,900
session will be down until the other

796
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:29,499
side is updated we have the ability to

797
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:32,319
push out all the configs within a few

798
00:38:29,499 --> 00:38:34,538
seconds by doing parallel streams with

799
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:36,609
these scripts most of the time that's

800
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:41,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">not necessary we just push out one at a</font>

801
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:42,819
time as necessary I don't really tell

802
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:45,160
you much speed of delivery though I'm

803
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:47,319
talking about when one is the pushes

804
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,178
fails right so you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font>

805
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:51,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep track of state on on multiple</font>

806
00:38:49,179 --> 00:38:53,589
devices to determine whether descriptive

807
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:55,749
completed for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the complete set of places</font>

808
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:58,479
we run into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the complete configuration</font>

809
00:38:55,749 --> 00:38:59,979
if the network is clean and you know not

810
00:38:58,479 --> 00:39:02,819
mark dirty anymore rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than an</font>

811
00:38:59,979 --> 00:39:05,078
individual device or or script

812
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:07,359
partitioned config portion of a device

813
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:09,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so after the scripts are run all</font>

814
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,900
the changes of push we can rerun the

815
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:14,109
same script with a different option to

816
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:15,789
report out what is still failing and if

817
00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:17,380
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes back everything passes then</font>

825
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:38,618
about the structure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the configuration</font>

management system but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

827
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:42,190
cultural issue you said you're looking

828
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,690
to hire software engineers not network

829
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:46,239
engineers and I assume that's because

830
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:48,309
one of the biggest problems that network

831
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:49,749
engineering shops have with automating

832
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:51,279
network engineering is that it puts

833
00:39:49,749 --> 00:39:53,499
network engineers out of business and

834
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:55,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very different job that needs to</font>

be done how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you deal with that like</font>

836
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:59,019
there's a core<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean they're</font>

837
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,180
people here have been ranting about this

838
00:39:59,019 --> 00:40:03,669
for you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple decades now about</font>

839
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,899
monkeys on keyboards but like in reality

840
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,279
there's still a lot of monkeys on

841
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,859
keyboards and lots of us feel better

842
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:10,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we type things in it just feel like</font>

843
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:11,920
we're doing something and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though we</font>

844
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,538
know that's wrong like that's the wrong

845
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,099
way to do something but we feel like

846
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:17,559
we're doing something how do you deal

847
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:19,539
with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so did everybody get the</font>

00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:21,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">question the question was in defect and</font>

849
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:23,650
summarize it was basically that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

850
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:26,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">people feel that automation will take</font>

851
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:30,069
number of a job and some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us just feel</font>

852
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:32,380
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we type stuff in so how do</font>

853
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:34,239
you reconcile all of those so I if you

854
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:38,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to pull back a little bit and think</font>

855
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:41,200
about the stem production of of

856
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:43,960
Engineers right the stem production<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

857
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,379
the u.s. is much more heavily tailored

858
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,089
towards CS as opposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to network</font>

859
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,559
engineering specialities in fact most

860
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:52,719
places don't have network engineering

861
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:55,210
specialities so if you if i just look

862
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:57,099
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> five ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going forward into</font>

863
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:59,049
where the networks and systems like i

864
00:40:57,099 --> 00:41:03,130
mentioned earlier evolving to by

865
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:05,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">definition I need to go where the the</font>

866
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:07,299
engineers are right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like why do you</font>

867
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:09,759
rob banks I rob banks because that's

868
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:12,940
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money is and so now i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

869
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:14,739
to tailor my systems to go to where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

870
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,839
money is and in this case the money is

871
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:18,579
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineering and engineering the vast</font>

872
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:21,400
majority of people that are relevant to

873
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:24,069
this industry are coming out of software

874
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,569
engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> CS degrees sorry sorry i</font>

875
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:27,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly the right thing to</font>

876
00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:29,979
do one good<font color="#CCCCCC"> olympic ahsha's how do you</font>

877
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:32,859
sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm damned getting there right so</font>

878
00:41:29,979 --> 00:41:34,180
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> part is that by definition i</font>

879
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:36,788
have to go to software engineering

880
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:39,669
anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so the second part is then</font>

881
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:40,960
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you transition our existing base</font>

882
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:42,550
while keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system</font>

883
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,470
running into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a software center culture</font>

884
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:46,540
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that work</font>

885
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:49,180
here the first principle<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that as you</font>

886
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:51,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">are well aware and so is Edward these</font>

887
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,919
systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> are too large to reason think or</font>

888
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:56,080
even type stuff in by hand anymore so

889
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:01,839
there are no other option did I

890
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:04,210
say that so that's one by<font color="#E5E5E5"> definition not</font>

891
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:08,200
just you can't just do it the second

892
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:12,550
part is that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really a role</font>

893
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:15,129
removal I am I'm hiring my team

894
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:17,109
essentially by I'm doubling the size of

895
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:21,609
my team this fiscal year which starts

896
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:26,710
now in<font color="#CCCCCC"> three weeks I'm doubling the team</font>

897
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:29,770
because what I don't need highly paid hi

898
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:33,940
GNA folks to type stuff into router<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

899
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:35,589
not a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> use of their time v I need</font>

900
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:38,140
them to start thinking and reasoning

901
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:41,259
about design goals about operating

902
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:42,970
principles so they can feed back stuff

903
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:44,260
two coders even within the coding

904
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:47,950
community it's not like one giant

905
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:49,510
amorphous blob of quarters right there

906
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:50,710
are people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do testing their</font>

907
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,940
people that want to do new features

908
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:56,320
there are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very good at</font>

909
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:57,940
doing maintenance right so even<font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font>

910
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,770
the network engineering field it's not a

911
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:02,410
blob of network engineers that type

912
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:06,339
stuff in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in two routers those are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

913
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:08,140
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are spending time typing</font>

914
00:43:06,339 --> 00:43:11,259
stuff in where I would rather have them

915
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:13,629
spend time thinking about other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

916
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:16,300
like how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do it design how do i do a</font>

917
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:18,580
regional routing system as I expand to

918
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:20,349
emerging markets how do I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

919
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:24,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">that how do I operationalize and</font>

920
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:26,800
implement scripting how do i make my RMA

921
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,680
process more efficient I want them to

922
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">think more high-level design not type</font>

923
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,779
stuff in and most<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are good</font>

924
00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:37,270
and the ones that you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep</font>

925
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:39,700
anyway are bored and don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> type in</font>

926
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:41,470
two routers for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most part so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

927
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,029
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> dovetails very well in and</font>

928
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:44,649
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always going to be people and</font>

929
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,880
this always going to be need from a

930
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:48,790
break fix and an operational perspective

931
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,740
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> of turnips or bass configs who want</font>

932
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:54,670
to do stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> on routers unfortunately</font>

933
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:55,149
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a requirement in some ways and</font>

934
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:58,060
will contain

935
00:43:55,150 --> 00:44:04,380
would be but that's it in my thinking

936
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:06,940
that's a career limited role thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aunt</font>

Warren welter to warn you please<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

salt call it non-traditional I'm

943
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:27,580
assuming right now the target<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pushing</font>

things into existing disparate boxes may

vs changing is this something you're

00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:33,669
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in terms of a completely</font>

specifically working on right now things

that we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> think with traditional</font>

951
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:47,070
routers with consoles and the problem

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so in general this is a</font>

954
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:55,690
operates on is in some ways completely

955
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:58,500
orthogonal to the problem what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">are doing here is semantic development</font>

957
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:04,240
what it operates on is<font color="#E5E5E5"> syntactic sugar</font>

00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:08,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">whether operates on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Juniper or a Cisco</font>

or alcatel-lucent or whatever cool is is

960
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:12,610
syntactic sugar and is irrelevant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

961
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:15,640
larger principles at work here so

whether operates on a SD<font color="#CCCCCC"> n-type network</font>

00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:21,490
is is almost in one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would argue is not</font>

964
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:23,170
really relevant except to the point

965
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:24,939
where Edward was talking about because

966
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:26,260
that is more closely coupled than what

967
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:29,220
we have today this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what they were</font>

968
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:33,460
saying that some of the syntax input or

969
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:35,740
CLI exposure lends<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself to some</font>

problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example we consistency with</font>

971
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:39,609
the facts what Edward was talking about

972
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:41,520
yesterday is actually a very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font>

973
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:44,950
where you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the entire</font>

974
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,840
unit as it as a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> entity and</font>

975
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:49,629
operate on it in different fashion but

976
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:51,580
the principles are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still the same it's</font>

977
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:53,890
the implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's a little</font>

978
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:55,720
different and there some<font color="#CCCCCC"> deltas with</font>

979
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:58,270
with transactional consistency which are

980
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:01,509
easier to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with in what the SDN type</font>

981
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:03,550
workflow is versus our current piecemeal

982
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:07,080
unit at a time current<font color="#E5E5E5"> state of the</font>

983
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:07,080
rotting art and that's that
