Thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> You</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jessie that was scary but now</font>

2
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:12,870
it's time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lightning talks and</font>

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:18,539
first up here is Tony who's going to

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:26,430
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DNS changer and yes I'll</font>

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:29,070
just leave him thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so as</font>

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:34,769
you can see for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those of you know Mary</font>

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:36,270
Kay I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> her and she was unable to</font>

8
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">attend to the last minute because she</font>

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,780
hurt her back and can't drive the

10
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,360
distance it takes to get here<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,629
offered to present the slides on her

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,789
behalf because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have some familiarity</font>

13
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:53,579
with the subject matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> to could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

14
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:55,920
reset the clock work<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and it's</font>

15
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,649
also a timely topic that's important so

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,930
I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to get missed this time</font>

17
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,480
so we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked briefly about what</font>

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,099
students change or what the takedown

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,039
would happen during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the takedown and</font>

20
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:11,460
replacement of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> seas servers customer</font>

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,070
infection remediation statistics efforts

22
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:18,240
and what happens on<font color="#E5E5E5"> July ninth which is</font>

23
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,729
only a little more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> month away so</font>

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:26,789
for those who don't know Dina's changer

25
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:29,460
is a malware that changes the dns

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,200
settings on on victimized machines and

27
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,079
also tries to reconfigure the home

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,380
gateway to point at<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS servers that</font>

29
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,110
were operated by a<font color="#E5E5E5"> criminal enterprise</font>

30
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:42,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">of folks that were mostly located over</font>

31
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:47,130
in Europe and there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> coordinated</font>

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,890
law enforcement effort to take down

33
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:53,670
these to arrest these individuals take

34
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,979
their assets and prosecute them and what

35
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:03,140
basically what it was was to make money

36
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:06,310
off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> illegitimate ad insertion traffic</font>

37
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:09,919
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net blocks involved</font>

38
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:14,510
the what happened during the takedown

39
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:16,309
was that the seized servers which were

40
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:22,519
actually physically located in the US

41
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:25,510
were replaced<font color="#CCCCCC"> by ones that that operated</font>

42
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:30,830
normally and and and generally gave

43
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:33,859
correct answers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so the they were put</font>

44
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:36,290
in the place<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> existing servers on</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same existing address space in the</font>

46
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:42,530
same ISPs were continued to advertise

47
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,510
that address space so that there was an

48
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,490
interruption of service a blackout for

49
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,100
all the people using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad DNS servers</font>

50
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:52,610
for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because of them just going</font>

51
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:54,620
away that was back in November and this

52
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,770
is kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick cartoon about</font>

53
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,380
how how it happened they took the

56
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:13,190

57
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:14,959
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> took the information from the</font>

that there's information on the DC WG

there's also information there about how

to detect whether you're infected in

that have chosen to redirect to

basically in cary internal routes for

that address space and pointed at their

own internal dns servers that's all done

00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,638
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> positive outcome in mind which is</font>

91
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,279
to keep their users running and also to

00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:06,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to internally detect whether</font>

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:14,969
so that they can notify them and help

them remediate there are tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have</font>

been work to try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> help clean it up</font>

97
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:24,210
unfortunately this malware is really

98
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:28,710
nasty it affects the boot Master Boot

99
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:31,409
Record and and often actually

100
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,719
reformatting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk is is that the</font>

00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:37,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">only thing that will really fix it but</font>

102
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:39,930
there's also cases where it's updating

103
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:43,770
the home router let's see I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

104
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:46,409
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next slide there's a number of</font>

105
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,870
ones that since obviously probably

106
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:51,199
everyone here knows that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the many home</font>

107
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:54,659
routers ship with the default config<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

108
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,330
user login credentials it'll try and

00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">exploit those to reset the the configure</font>

the router not actually install malware

111
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,688
on the router but that's one nasty

112
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:09,629
aspect of it so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little cartoon</font>

113
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:11,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was supposed to show essentially</font>

114
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:14,460
what what happens how how an affected

115
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:16,529
home router can make it appear that

116
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,620
device is behind it that are not even

117
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:22,979
affected with malware like a smartphone

118
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,860
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a printer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or what have you it will</font>

119
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:28,000
also may show up so if you if you try

120
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">and get to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,090
that shows the different green or red

122
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:36,010
based on your infection you may see it

123
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,679
on device<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not infected but</font>

there<font color="#E5E5E5"> were some spurious spikes in the</font>

beginning but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all started on november</font>

132
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,390
eighth when the when the replacement

133
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,060
servers were put in and it's been

134
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,979
trending generally downward but there's

135
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's been about forty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent remediated</font>

136
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:15,419
by this metric and there's still well

00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:17,890
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> three hundred thousand apparently</font>

affected people although that may be

139
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,409
something where there's a number of

enterprise firewall that that that's

142
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,560
masking some larger number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of infections</font>

143

but this is the course coarse-grained

151
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:07,950
helped but still basically lots of

152
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:10,000
infections so part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all it to</font>

153
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:13,210
thinking back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> jesse's doc you know</font>

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,360
it's a bottom-up community organization

155
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:18,310
involvement and trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out you</font>

156
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,979
know what went well and what didn't is a

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:24,040
little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the exercise people</font>

158
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:26,469
have probably seen discussion on the on

the nanog list about well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've got this</font>

161
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,330
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense or i didn't care or</font>

162
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,169
what have you so that's all part of the

163
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:40,979
learning experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more feedback is</font>

164
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:44,500
appreciated constructive feedback

165
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,180
so what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen is in less</font>

166
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,490
than a month's time no sorry slightly

167
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,260
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a month's time those the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> court</font>

replacement servers so people who are

170
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,410
still pointing at them will we believe

171
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,510
go offline because they won't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

resolve<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS there's possible it's</font>

173
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:06,660
possible that some<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating systems</font>

174
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:10,510
will fall back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dynamically learned</font>

175
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:12,189
DNS servers so it's not completely known

176
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,439
what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> will happen with all of them</font>

177
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">but there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may be a wave of extra support</font>

might that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be helpful because</font>

181
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:27,280
better that you do it proactively while

00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,959
they're still online before they just

183
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:33,490
call you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you know what happened</font>

that record put in<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

186
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,529
so any questions I do have some

187
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,329
familiarity with the topic but I can't

188
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:56,579
necessarily answer everything that she

189
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:56,579
may have put in here questions comments

190
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:23,709
all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> no oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very sorry next up is</font>

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:49,720
amante from level 3 i'm here to talk

198
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:51,939
about resource certification using dns

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,339
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> IRRs some things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been</font>

202
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:07,600
castor oil from verisign so the broadly

203
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:09,009
I think there's a probably agreement

204
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,600
that the three Horsemen of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

205
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:16,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">is three things the IRS the Internet</font>

206
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,730
routing registry specifically is what is

207
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:24,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">encoding routing policy information what</font>

208
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:26,709
is the intent of what is an AS wants to

209
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:28,959
originate or effectuate from a routing

210
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:31,949
perspective you have the output<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the</font>

211
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:35,589
results of the policy information

212
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:37,839
carried inside bgp that's routing that's

213
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:39,970
reach ability information and then last

214
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,550
but not least you have dns which is

215
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,730
naming right naming is obviously very

216
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:48,128
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's what gets</font>

217
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:50,559
everyone to their destinations without

218
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:52,779
having to memorize IP addresses so these

219
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">are very three very critical systems</font>

220
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:59,189
that are already deployed scaled being

221
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:03,780
used and they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been for well over</font>

222
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:07,710
a decade if not longer so the question

223
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:11,040
came up as to why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just use the IRS</font>

224
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:13,440
for resource certification and usually

225
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,339
the first answer you get back is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRR</font>

226
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,520
sucks period and then you ask ok well

227
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:23,220
why you know what does that really mean

228
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:25,680
because there's aspects to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IRRs</font>

229
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,050
there's the data portion of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRS and</font>

230
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,300
then there's the routing policy

231
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:32,160
specification language or<font color="#E5E5E5"> our psl the</font>

232
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,349
latter of which is a very rich syntax

233
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,380
which allows which is very expressive

234
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,380
and allows one to express many things

235
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a routing policy perspective and</font>

236
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,430
usually the concerns are not around the

237
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:46,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">RP SL but around the data or the quality</font>

238
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:49,949
of the data and that's really what the

239
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,870
the fundamental<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue is is I don't</font>

240
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:55,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">really know what data within the IRS to</font>

241
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:57,390
trust so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question I asked back is</font>

242
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,230
can we actually improve I are our data

243
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:05,640
quality and I believe the answer is yes

244
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:10,610
with the light assist from<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS so the</font>

245
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,610
question is will why<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS well why not</font>

246
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:16,470
obviously I'm not sure how many folks

247
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:22,440
are aware but DNS SEC is deployed for

248
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:25,920
reverse<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns we've in fact signed several</font>

/ sixteens through<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron already it's a</font>

250
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:33,750
very quick painless process to actually

251
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:37,470
set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and works just fine I'll talk</font>

252
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:39,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of slides the the</font>

253
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:42,540
other important points worth mentioning

254
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:45,060
is that in DNS in particular there's a

255
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route obviously and there's a</font>

00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,979
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust anchor that is deployed for</font>

257
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:53,430
DNS SEC that's operational today which

258
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:56,310
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all good obviously given the</font>

259
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:58,439
operational experience we have in

260
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:00,750
deploying DNS for the last couple of

261
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,990
decades there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously substantial</font>

262
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:07,290
resiliency and scalability to DNS and by

263
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:09,300
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can easily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of</font>

264
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:13,319
a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> different scenarios one is</font>

265
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:15,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">anycast DNS is a mechanism that's widely</font>

267
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-availability reasons as well as the</font>

268
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,910
capability to deploy multiple name

269
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,319
servers and obviously you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should deploy</font>

270
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,269
multiple name servers across multiple

271
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:30,509
networks of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> for maximum</font>

00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:31,889
resiliency if you don't know how to do

273
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:34,649
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things than perhaps you should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

274

<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a provider that does do these</font>

275
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:39,990
types of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and entrust them with</font>

276
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:41,699
your DNS and then last but not least of

277
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,680
course there's obviously a massive

278
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:46,439
amount of monitoring documentation

279
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,709

around<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS for the last several decades</font>

281
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:53,880
as well so it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very nice to leverage</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that same already deployed</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">could such a system work what we would</font>

one

310
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:15,900

311
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:20,280
coming up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a set of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP prefix origin</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a.s pairs next step would be after that</font>

313
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:25,500
you actually go through and you verify

318
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:42,810
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the AAS or origin is</font>

320

what you is what you pulled<font color="#E5E5E5"> out from the</font>

321
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:52,920
IRR and then last but not least

322
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:55,650
obviously if it matches then you're you

323
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,229
have a sect of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Li a secure route origin</font>

325
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:04,860
broken so here's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

326
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:08,670
details of what the DNS lookup process

327
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:10,229
would actually be obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

328
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:13,350
there's only three steps here it's

329
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:17,459
hopefully pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple obviously if the</font>

330
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:20,219
DNS SEC SRO resource records set matches

331

what you pulled out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRR for an IP</font>

333
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,870
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a signed authenticated response</font>

334
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:32,310
following the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS hierarchy that that's</font>

335
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:34,530
a valid origin obviously if that's the

336
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:38,370
case you can include<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in either IP</font>

337
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:40,530
prefix lists with origin<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s matches</font>

338
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,320
inside routing filters that you're going

339
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:45,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to apply two routers inside your network</font>

340
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,070
or you could just use it for offline

341
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:51,600
manual verification if you want it to do

342
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:54,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and and and using information as</font>

343
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,000
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to we already talked a little</font>

344
00:17:54,060 --> 00:18:00,330
bit about the second step was if that's

345
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,550
invalid if the DNS SRO resource records

346
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,320
set does not match what you pulled out

347
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IRR then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's considered invalid</font>

348
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,899
you should not include that in your IP

349
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:11,550
prefix list step 3 obviously a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

350
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,130
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more tricky what if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a not</font>

351
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,560
found coming back from<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS what if you</font>

352
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:20,760
don't know what to do with it well if

353
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:24,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a more specific that you have</font>

354
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:27,119
already validated a covering aggregate

355
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:30,570
because you've basically pulled a less

356
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:33,389
specific covering aggregate out of the

357
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">IRS and you validated that against DNS</font>

358
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:37,439
and this is most likely a Miss

359
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:39,599
configuration case where someone forgot

360
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,539
to go in code the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific inside a</font>

361
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">DNS so I say go ahead and trust it</font>

362
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:46,710
because you have a covering aggregate

363
00:18:43,979 --> 00:18:49,139
with the same origin<font color="#CCCCCC"> as4 it on the other</font>

364
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,999
hand if you consider that the prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

365
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:52,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">origin is does not match a valid</font>

366
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:55,889
aggregate then it's invalid and you drop

367
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:59,279
it so give you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of examples of</font>

368
00:18:55,889 --> 00:19:01,830
the encoding inside of DNS SEC this is

369
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:05,369
an example of a couple of prefixes that

370
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:09,239
we've encoded various prefix lengths you

371
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:11,549
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> there a / 20 s / 22 / 24 in fact</font>

372
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:14,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can go and run these same dig</font>

373
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:18,379
queries yourself at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your leisure and</font>

374
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:21,658
verify that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do match and</font>

375
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:25,259
then last but not least as far as

376
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:26,879
conclusions go hopefully everyone agrees

377
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:28,200
that using DNS SEC<font color="#E5E5E5"> for resource</font>

378
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:31,289
certification is actually a pretty

379
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,539
straightforward process actually using

380
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:35,070
DNS SEC<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I are ours is also a very</font>

381
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:37,679

382

chains and training<font color="#E5E5E5"> already built and</font>

385
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:47,178

386
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:47,179
minute for questions

387
00:19:54,499 --> 00:20:01,200

not really sure what you're alluding to

00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,809
but this is a very lightweight and

validates one piece of the route object

413
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:10,349
just digitally sign the route object so

414
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:12,239
maybe the piece that you're not

415
00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:15,239
understanding is that when I build

416
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:17,789
prefix lists and origin<font color="#CCCCCC"> es filters that</font>

417
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:19,229
I applied towards my customers I already

418
00:21:17,789 --> 00:21:21,869
have a tool chain that's built around

419
00:21:19,229 --> 00:21:24,299
pulling information from the IRS which

420
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:27,029
gives me a fully enumerated list of IP

421
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:28,979
prefixes in origin a esas which then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

422
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:31,499
can very simply walk through one at a

423
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:34,109
time and validate and if I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

424
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:37,049
authentic signature back I can then say

425
00:21:34,109 --> 00:21:40,649
with assurance that that is a valid

426
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:43,019
origin<font color="#CCCCCC"> is tied with that particular IP</font>

427
00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:45,029
prefix so it gives me an enumeration

428
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:50,489
capability as perhaps the key thing that

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm trying to say here ok guys</font>

been suggestions<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ruettiger was one of</font>

436
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:14,720
the ones who first put it forth to do

437
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:19,010
something to use the row as in the rpki

438
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:20,419
system to produce something like route

439
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,780
objects that can be used with the

440
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:26,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">existing tools to build filtered lists</font>

441
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:28,850
there's also a draft before the site or

442
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:32,990
working group in the ITF right now to

443
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:36,199
use rpki certificates to do

444
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:41,890
authentication of information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in</font>

445
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:44,270
the RP SL it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RPS l sing stuff and</font>

446
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:46,640
what was I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go there's a subtle</font>

447
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:50,150
difference in the semantics of the SRO

448
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:56,720
and the robot object in the RP ki and

449
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:59,870
the route object have you looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

450
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:03,770
way the RPS s the defined security

system for<font color="#CCCCCC"> irrs defines the authority</font>

452
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:09,830
for route objects so again I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not here</font>

453
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:11,390
to talk about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpki i'm here to talk</font>

454
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,549
about existing tool sets that are

455
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,830
already in use in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

456
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:19,070
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the things like the IRR</font>

457
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:22,129
power tool set like the PE of l and all

458
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:26,750
those sorts of things you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

459
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:28,730
yet you've not using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpki currently</font>

460
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">i know you aren't and so I think I don't</font>

461
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,230
have any early to extract information

462
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:35,150
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpki and stick it into and</font>

463
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,770
quite frankly I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to stick with the</font>

464
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:39,559
existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems that I've already got</font>

465
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:43,220
deployed and leverage those as my path

466
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:46,309
going forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay is there you're</font>

467
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:50,270
talking about ways to improve the route

468
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:52,010
object on data that's in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRR with</font>

469
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:54,289
the data that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing in DNS SEC</font>

470
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:57,710
correct do you think you will take a

471
00:23:54,289 --> 00:24:01,450
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what is being proposed to use</font>

472
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:04,850
rpki data to provide authentication for

473
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:08,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">irr data so I'm familiar with that work</font>

474
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:12,679
but I'm not here to comment on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I'm</font>

475
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:21,450
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> you whether you would know</font>

476
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:23,220
thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your refusal semi or</font>

477
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:26,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sparta so you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about how the</font>

478
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:28,200
reverse tree is very well signed catches

479
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,970
the reverse tree doesn't currently have

480
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,040
a naming convention for net blocks are

481
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:34,620
in this new one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gursha</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mothers are</font>

482
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,270
proposing and when I've looked at that

483
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,040
naming scheme it looks like is not quite

484
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:40,530
a parallel tree but sort of an overlaid

485
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,080
tree or it's actually not fully deployed

486
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:45,240
so you talked about using<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in some /</font>

487
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,699
16<font color="#CCCCCC"> switch I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe but I think that</font>

488
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">using a / 15 would actually be very</font>

489
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:53,820
challenging right now is that accurate

490
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:55,950
so that's accurate in so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you</font>

491
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,409
need to we would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get cooperation</font>

492
00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:01,650
from the rars that would hold that

493
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:04,650
reverse tree to do this naming<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheme</font>

494
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:06,570
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily a DNS expert here so</font>

495
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,680
i would actually defer you to Eric who's

496
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:10,350
actually at the mic that can probably

497
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:14,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">give you a better answer could I could I</font>

498
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:18,030
I have to cut you out I'm sorry Eric but

499
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,680
I have to make a commercial for the DNS

500
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:21,270
track in the afternoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that</font>

501
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:26,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a great place to continue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

502
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:29,790
discussion I just say one thing like 30

503
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">see 20 seconds 20 I'll do a 15 I think</font>

504
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:33,600
unchanged second or third slide he

505
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,030
pointed<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the IRS are giving them</font>

507
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,670
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other systems you guys are</font>

508
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,040
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about i think that's why he</font>

509
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:44,670
threw those in there ya know Rudy good

510
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:49,200
know what what policy definitions has

511
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:50,910
shane actually fun we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

512
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,010
discussion about tomorrow as well

513
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:59,210
because we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> more presentations in</font>

514
00:25:53,010 --> 00:26:03,300
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> subject you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will get more and</font>

515
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:04,170
welcome to edward from google everybody

516
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think at this point i have like</font>

517
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,590
negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes so i try to keep</font>

518
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:11,159
it brief and get you out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of here so you</font>

519
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:13,139
can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing so you</font>

520
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:16,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">know Google likes to talk about open</font>

521
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,850
flow a lot open flow in general has the

522
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,040
hype machine running on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty hard</font>

523
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,929
right now

524
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,480
there haven't been a lot of real

525
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:25,160
deployments as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know we have the</font>

526
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,560
world's<font color="#E5E5E5"> largest open flow deployment</font>

527
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,360
currently in terms of total

00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,700
state-managed total number of nodes

529
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,320
deployed total pops pretty much you name

530
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,670
it so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

531
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:39,139
about that and I'm also going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

532
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:41,870
about how we did it if there's time so

533
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:45,110
Google has a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> network you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

534
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:50,360
knew this already if you believe Craig

00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:53,320
labovitz which I do sometimes in 2010 we

536
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,639
were the world's second largest network

537
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,580
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is before the agglomeration of</font>

00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:10,490
network though our back in network is

541
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:12,409
actually much larger than<font color="#CCCCCC"> our front-end</font>

542
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,690

point one point two hours per second so

548
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:30,260
anyway yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's big and we push a lot</font>

549
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:33,350
of content over it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have two</font>

scale backbone that orgy scale which

554
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,290

only<font color="#E5E5E5"> runs between the data centers that</font>

00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:53,210
it only carries kind of bulk data

00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:54,500
traffic for us index pushes etc etc as a

<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more experimental with the back end</font>

566

stuff and that is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> open flow network</font>

techniques for doing optimization of

573
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:28,059
crap

574
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,520
engineering on the front end in general

575
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:31,660
you can do pretty standard traffic

576
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,150
engineering because we have a fairly

577
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,830
smooth diurnal cycle there's a few

578
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:37,990
exceptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that obviously on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

579
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:41,168
end though we have extremely bursty

580
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:44,530
traffic when index push starts it's

581
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:46,299
basically a square wave and since we

582
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:47,590
have some idea about what the schedules

583
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:50,730
for these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we can take</font>

584
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:53,409
advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this in traffic engineering</font>

585
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:55,450
so why do a software-defined<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wayne in</font>

586
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:59,260
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first place what's not sufficient</font>

587
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:00,809
about existing protocols well a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

588
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:04,510
it has to do with the hardware honestly

589
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:06,190
so in doing this we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to separate the</font>

590
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,450
hardware from the control plane software

591
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:11,020
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means we get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take advantage</font>

592
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:14,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a very cheap fairly high powered</font>

593
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:17,010
commodity compute and that is a good

594
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:18,700
thing as i'm sure you all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

595
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,890
controllers that you're putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

596
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,090
routers are you know four or five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

597
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:25,150
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of date and you're paying a great</font>

598
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:27,459
deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them so it's very nice that we</font>

599
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,020
had to make use of our bulk compute

600
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,280
infrastructure for doing a lot of the

601
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:34,690
stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to do with regard to</font>

602
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:37,030
optimization in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition the fact that</font>

603
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,710
is logically centralized gives us a more

604
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:41,350
complete view of total network state

605
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:43,540
which makes for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of pretty</font>

606
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,309
interesting opportunities in

607
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:48,070
optimization and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about</font>

608
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a little bit later it also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gives us</font>

609
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,909
the ability to automate fairly simply

610
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:53,139
part of the problem with running a very

611
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:54,160
large heterogeneous environment

612
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,450
obviously is that you have a lot of

613
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:59,650
northbound API is in the form of

614
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:01,450
different config systems or XML or etc

615
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,919
etc and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so having to deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

616
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,570
stuff in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-uniform way is kind of a</font>

617
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:07,780
pain as we all know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think Vijay is</font>

618
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:12,370
going to talk about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

619
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:14,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that too distant future and we also get</font>

00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">to control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both the horizontal and</font>

621
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,730
vertical on this network so having fine

622
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:20,350
gain control state like this let's just

623
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,429
do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty interesting things and as</font>

624
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:23,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said I'm going to talk a little bit</font>

625
00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:24,760
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so in general the theory is</font>

626
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this results in a higher</font>

627
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,820
performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> land that's more efficient</font>

628
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:32,110
more fault tolerant and cheaper

629
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:34,710
basically we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get better ROI so where is</font>

630
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:37,449
this deployed pretty much everywhere

631
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:39,840
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is public information</font>

632
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:42,549
Greenpeace actually did a really great

633
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,039
article on data center locations

634
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:47,080
recently and modulo you know the wattage

635
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,389
they got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of stuff right so he's</font>

636
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,620
never underestimate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> power of two</font>

637
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:55,209
hippies and paisley with a pair of

638
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:58,389
binoculars but yeah it's deployed

639
00:30:55,210 --> 00:31:00,159
globally at this point and you can see

640
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:02,320
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to see for me at</font>

641
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,429
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry but you can see we've</font>

642
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,980
been working on it for about the last

643
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:07,960
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're starting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

644
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:11,169
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to taper off as the</font>

645
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,409
complete set of back-end traffic has

646
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:17,169
been migrated onto the open flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

647
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:22,870
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sample</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> utilization across the</font>

648
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:27,309
set of links in the network yeah so run

649
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:28,870
stuff pretty hot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general this this</font>

650
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:30,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously be problematic if we</font>

651
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:32,229
were worried about you know if we were

652
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,699
doing like standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> mm1 modeling for</font>

653
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:35,649
queuing delay or any of this stuff and

654
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,000
we're actually concerned about that this

655
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:39,729
would not really be all that tenable

656
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,710
moreover we were worried about standard

657
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:44,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP transport protocol semantics</font>

658
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:47,139
with regard to having some sort of

659
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,879
sawtooth going on we that would be a

660
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:50,350
problem fortunately because of the fact

661
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,809
that we run this network and we run all

662
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:55,899
the systems that are on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get to use</font>

663
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:57,309
non-standard transport protocols we also

664
00:31:55,899 --> 00:32:05,199
get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a lot of fairly interesting</font>

665
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:06,370
stuff with regard to scheduling so so

666
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,980
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the implications for network</font>

667
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:10,779
operators well the pros are that we've

668
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,370
seen it reduce the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the total</font>

00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:15,250

670
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:17,559

671
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:19,000
for op<font color="#E5E5E5"> ex currently actually I think</font>

672
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:20,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that you know we're going</font>

673
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,909
through some growing pains but there's a

674
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,590
lot of potential here in terms of

675
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:27,730
automation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were would be difficult</font>

00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:29,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get in other areas we get to do less</font>

677
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,370
over-provisioning for SLA is this is

678
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:33,340
because the protocols that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

679
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:35,168
entirely deterministic modulo<font color="#CCCCCC"> the demand</font>

680
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,730
being non deterministic now because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

681
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:38,440
the fact that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have some idea</font>

682
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,360
of what we're transferring between

683
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,789
systems and we can schedule these things

684
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,360
they're a little bit less

685
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:45,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">non-deterministic than you might think</font>

686
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,219
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a certain amount of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">uncertainty there however given a demand</font>

00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:46,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">also vary based on your demand</font>

716
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,549
characteristics as I said you know the

00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,590
more square wave of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your demand is and</font>

718
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:54,100
the better you know the schedules the

what this google Software Defined Wayne

721
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:04,659
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like well this is built</font>

722
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:07,390
from our own hardware that we've been

723
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:08,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">working on for a little while in general</font>

724
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's entirely built out of merchant</font>

725
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:11,830
silicon and it features open<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow</font>

726
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:14,500
support which was something that we

727
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:17,739
weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get from any of the</font>

00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,940
vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the time in general we would</font>

729
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:20,618
have liked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have purchased this stuff</font>

730
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:24,129
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> developing your own hardware and</font>

731
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:29,050
is a pain in the ass pardon my french

732
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:30,699
but we couldn't at the time so we also

733
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:33,760
used open source routing stacks in

734
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:35,379
particular quagga to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP and is is</font>

735
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,940
for the sake of the initial integrations

736
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:38,139
likely the BGP portion will obviously

737
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,780
stay around for a while because we're

738
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:43,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have to interface with a lot of</font>

743
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,460
software that we write is extremely

744
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:59,290
minimal and it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

745
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:03,480
little bit user unfriendly at times but

746
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,480
it's also cheap and functional so

747
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:09,270
obviously you deploy multiple chassis

748
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:13,680
for site blah blah blah so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it</font>

749
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:16,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually look like well we have what is</font>

750
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,419
effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> out-of-band controller array</font>

751
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,900
these are a bunch of machines that are

752
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,070
just pushing flow mods down to

753
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,890
individual devices and these are

754
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:28,320
deployed on a per data center basis in

755
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:30,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">addition there are quagga machines that</font>

756
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,830
are associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the controller</font>

757
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,420
arrays that runs through what's

00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:36,029
effectively a large rib manager which

00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,610
engineering server and these two things

762
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:48,569
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> in parallel and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry</font>

763
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:50,340
basically the traffic engineering server

764
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:52,530
just pushes out stuff and that

765
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:55,530
represents<font color="#E5E5E5"> the overlay topology on the</font>

767
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,680
do this we have a global broker which is

768
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,850
effectively a global scheduler<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

770
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:08,940
much we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a path allocation</font>

771
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:11,240
algorithm which is you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see some of</font>

this work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more recent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> infocom</font>

we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> publishing some good research</font>

00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,940
on upward maxman fair throughput

00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,270
optimization and some other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

776

we've been looking at most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

777

probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maximum fair</font>

778
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,580
but when you're trying to schedule

779
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,689
really big data center pushes it can be

780
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:31,980
important so and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course the topology</font>

781
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,660
manager that has to collect state now

782
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,710
this is something of a point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

783
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,868
contention when people talk about

784
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:38,250
centralization or even a modicum of

785
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:39,660
centralization because of the fact that

786
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,280
people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the control loop is</font>

787
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,990
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be pretty flabby because it</font>

788
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,040
takes a while to gather the state<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

789
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,240
the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have any sort of</font>

790
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,040
accurate representation where you're

unable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check point it you may end up</font>

792
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,619
either out of sync or you're going to

793
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:53,340
end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an extremely loose and</font>

794
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:54,450
flabby control loop I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> my answer to</font>

795
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,040
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be obviously these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are all</font>

796
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,299
concerns and these are things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

797
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,480
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at but if you look at how</font>

798
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,770
fast the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TE control loop is right now</font>

799
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:08,310
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually pretty easy to get better</font>

800
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:10,050
than it we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a controller</font>

801
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,330
obviously the controller basically just

802
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,920
as I saying has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Quogue associated with</font>

803
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,819
it and a tunneling app running off to

804
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,420
the side

805
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,950
mods separately one with the

806
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,650
encapsulation that we use for the

807
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:25,470
tunnels to just direct hop-by-hop flow

808
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:28,050
state and then the other being you know

809
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,430
complete is is and bgp these push things

810
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,660
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to agents that are on the switches</font>

811
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,220
which then interface with a bunch of

812
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,600
hardware tables and obviously there's a

813
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:35,160
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of work if you're going to</font>

814
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,450
write your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own user agent for how you're</font>

815
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:41,190
actually going to interface with

816
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:42,509
whatever Hardware you have there's an

817
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,550
additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer of hierarchy on top of</font>

818
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,290
this because obviously if you have te

819
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,640
then you have some coordinated mechanism

820
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,990
this is actually kind of a sticking

821
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,120
point with a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these architectures</font>

822
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:54,390
right now in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> how are you going to</font>

823
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:56,130
distribute state between decentralized

824
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:59,580
te servers if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not making a</font>

complete decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a single server I</font>

826
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:04,560
will say it's quite difficult and if you

827
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:07,770
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about it later then</font>

828
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,840
we should I yeah because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

829
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:16,740
I'm at a time if you have any questions

please step up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the mic hi gender</font>

831
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:22,350
confusion do is do you share any state

832
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:24,090
between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I scale control plane and a</font>

833
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,860
G scale control plan at all or is it

834
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:28,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">just done through standard it's just</font>

835
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:36,350
like it just edged state so standard

836
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:36,350
protocol great thank you it would

837
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:50,640
and now it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for coffee after the</font>

838
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:56,370
coffee break we have the DNS track here

in this room hearing oh my<font color="#E5E5E5"> god sorry the</font>
