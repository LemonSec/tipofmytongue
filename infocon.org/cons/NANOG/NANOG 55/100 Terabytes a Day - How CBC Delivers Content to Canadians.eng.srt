there are some things that that we do at

government<font color="#E5E5E5"> owns us essentially we offer</font>

television this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just on the English</font>

side our French counterparts in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Montreal</font>

56
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:18,530
also have a wide range of properties as

57
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:20,930
well so when I thought when I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

58
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,310
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a title for this talk need</font>

59
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">something snazzy to get people in the</font>

60
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,720
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I said you know 100 terabytes a</font>

61
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,739
day I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shot myself on the foot</font>

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,129
when I actually crunched the numbers

63
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:32,810
because the best month so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> this year</font>

64
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:35,840
was in April<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we only did 73</font>

65
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:38,569
terabytes a day but out of all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:43,340
majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic is video video</font>

67
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:45,879
is a high-bandwidth service so it

68
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:49,010
accounts for about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three quarters of the</font>

69
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:53,540
of the bandwidth<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd we do to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

70
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:56,298
Canadians excuse me out of that we still

71
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,599
do we still did nine terabytes of data

72
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:01,970
on mobile devices in April and this was

73
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,440
mainly due to stanley cup playoffs a lot

74
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,879
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watch the hockey games</font>

75
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,879
on their on their mobile phones

76
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,690
so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this well we use to main</font>

77
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:21,548
content delivery networks Akamai

78
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:25,990
primarily and for the live radio we do

79
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:29,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use stream the world Akamai's been</font>

80
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:33,070
able to give us a great reach one of our

81
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,900
mandates is deliver deliver content to

82
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,430
Canadians as efficiently and as cheaply

83
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,120
as possible and Akamai allows us to do

84
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:43,090
that we've gotten origin offload irate

85
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,320
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety five percent so which means</font>

86
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,388
that ninety-five percent of our traffic

87
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,690
is delivered by Akamai and that allows

88
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:51,070
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep our costs keep our costs down</font>

89
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:55,810
without having to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build an extremely</font>

90
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:59,139
large origin infrastructure so just

91
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,720
quickly a CDN in a nutshell this graphic

92
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:03,669
was provided by Akamai you have the

93
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,280
origin infrastructure which for CBC<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

94
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:10,109
located in Toronto and Akamai has

95
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,638
roughly around 80,000 servers worldwide

96
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:17,760
which cash is our content and delivers

97
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:21,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">it to the end user and this allows us to</font>

98
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:24,639
deliver the content efficiently because

99
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,289
the majority of our traffic patterns is

100
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,659
would like to call<font color="#E5E5E5"> newsy so it's not</font>

101
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:33,250
predictable it's really bursty you don't

102
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:36,070
know when a major<font color="#E5E5E5"> event is going to</font>

103
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,240
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know something can happen in</font>

104
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,539
20 minutes and all of a sudden our

105
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,889
traffic increases<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20-fold but there are</font>

106
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:46,810
some situations where we can predict

107
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:48,900
specifically with<font color="#E5E5E5"> longtime events like</font>

108
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,909
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Summer Olympics that are coming up</font>

109
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">Federal Elections hockey playoffs that</font>

110
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:55,740
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things those those things that</font>

111
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:00,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a schedule we can predict in and</font>

112
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:03,460
prepare for but it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ump it's the</font>

113
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:06,690
unpredictable things that we that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use</font>

114
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,690
the CD ends for mainly

115
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,449
so here's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know if the</font>

116
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,389
graph is showing up very well but excuse

117
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:20,810
me Whitney Houston she died earlier this

118
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:23,750
year and we the spike of traffic

119
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,039
essentially just speaks for itself we're

120
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,310
just humming along nicely than all of a

121
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:31,820
sudden Wham it's I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> as 22 times are</font>

122
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,919
normal normal daily traffic and it's a

123
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,000
short-lived so it's just like for 20

124
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,190
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so half an hour everyone</font>

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes to the website the rush checks out</font>

126
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:41,539
what know what's going on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

127
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:43,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">leaves but for us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to</font>

128
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:45,050
anticipate this and to build out the

129
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:46,610
origin infrastructure with these types

130
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of spikes in mind wouldn't really be</font>

131
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,979
cost effective because<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety nine</font>

132
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:55,009
percent of the time it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> at idle at</font>

133
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:56,900
a level so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we rely on CDN specifically a</font>

134
00:06:55,009 --> 00:07:00,470
combined to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to to deliver this</font>

135
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,888
content here's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> example when Dick</font>

136
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:05,479
Clark died earlier she earlier this year

137
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,620
I guess he wasn't as popular as Whitney

138
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:11,630
Houston<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this bike was a lot</font>

139
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">lower but again same thing we were just</font>

140
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,320
chugging along at our normal rate and

141
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:21,010
then all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden this was about 15 x</font>

142
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:23,060
15 times<font color="#CCCCCC"> more regular traffic pattern so</font>

143
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,590
news organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:31,429
difficult because it's unpredictable

146
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:34,280
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> example here is streaming an NHL</font>

147
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,409
playoff game usually what happens with

148
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,049
with longer events like this you see

149
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:41,090
little dips during intermissions so

150
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,460
people leave during the first second

151
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:49,030
intermission they come back so you have

152
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:51,080
more of a of a wave a sine wave pattern

153
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:54,739
and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the game of one drops</font>

154
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,560
off so these types of traffic we can

155
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,820
predict but the scale is so large with

156
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,270
streaming video we're streaming at three

157
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:05,030
to five megabits per second and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

158
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,830
to be able to have the best experience

159
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:09,888
possible so having that video being

160
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:12,560
served locally to the user via CDN as

161

00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:29,550
x CBC is not the only company in Canada

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">and radio the point I'm trying to make</font>

172
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,080
here is that most media organizations in

173
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:55,890
Canada do peer with a CDN and it's

174
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,270
important when it comes to appearing

175
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,390
with these individuals that you do peer

176
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:05,160
with the CDN and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not with the with the</font>

177
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:06,600
origin itself and the reason why I say

178
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,030
that is because there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times</font>

179
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,130
where you know companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to us and</font>

180
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:16,709
say hey you know I pier with you guys

181
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here up here with you guys but all</font>

182
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,730
your traffic is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going over a different</font>

183
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">link and that's because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we deliver</font>

184
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,940
ninety-five percent of our traffic

185
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,670
through Akamai through CDN so it's

186
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,400
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you appear with them more</font>

187
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:34,680
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> than you do with with us with the</font>

188
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:37,920
origin now there is still a benefit

189
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,949
specifically with corporate traffic you

190
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,420
know like people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in the office going</font>

191
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to Google checking their mail that kind</font>

192
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,430
of stuff you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you still if CBC does</font>

193
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,230
pier with Google and Microsoft so we

194
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,810
still send some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that traffic to them</font>

195
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,970
but it's during<font color="#E5E5E5"> these large events where</font>

196
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,589
you know hits the fan and people

197
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,550
like oh my god our link is saturated

198
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:58,200
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going over the link</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

199
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,689
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go that's because you</font>

200
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,100
probably didn't appear with the CDN<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

201
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,970
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid that by boy that's</font>

202
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:12,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">scenario by doing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mmm we're at</font>

203
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:13,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">Toric's in Toronto 30 and torx has a</font>

00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,970
another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to mention was</font>

211
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,610
streaming so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> majority of the traffic</font>

212
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:40,190
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do is video streaming video and</font>

213
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">audio but it's not over what I like to</font>

214
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:46,760
call the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old-school protocols rtmp rtsp</font>

215
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:48,439
mms it's all done over HTTP now there's

216
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,360
a few advantages as a Content producer

217
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,720
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one we get away we get around</font>

218
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,120
firewalls a lot of a lot of companies

219
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,760
firewall streaming protocols but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font>

00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:03,500
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> push that through HTTP we get</font>

221
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:08,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">around that some people goes so far as</font>

222
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:11,540
to doing this over HTTPS there is that

223
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:13,070
misnomer that this is more secure but we

224
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,880
all know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ripper</font>

225
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:19,220
stream over HTTPS and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

226
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,380
streams now are like to call extremely

227
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,290
high bit rate for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet three to</font>

228
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,450
five<font color="#E5E5E5"> megabits so there's this hard to</font>

229
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,550
differentiate between streaming traffic

230
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,260
in the web traffic nowadays so that can

231
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:33,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">cause some problems with regards to</font>

232
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,580
traffic shaping and firewalling<font color="#CCCCCC"> buts</font>

233
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,080
great for us because it gets around

234
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,160
licensing issues we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

235
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:42,380
license a real media for example for RTS

236
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,360
rtsp and we get more eyeballs because

237
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:49,130
there's no firewalls blocking web

238
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:52,150
traffic so content producers one of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do we spend a lot of time</font>

240
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,870
optimizing our HTML images you know the

241
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">network is fast but it's not very fast</font>

242
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,100
if you have a 20 meg jpg on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> home</font>

00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">page and everyone's trying to download</font>

244
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:07,520
it so we always take a look at

245
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:11,660
optimizing our<font color="#CCCCCC"> front end we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use gzip</font>

246
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:15,199
compressions extensively on when we

247
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:17,569
deliver the our pages as well as we use

248
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,140
proper caching headers and and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

249
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:23,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's very important because caching</font>

250
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,520
content close to the user gives them a

251
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:28,280
better experience than having to go

252
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,220
across the content to get it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:33,589
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to mention is about</font>

we're like to call Lacey programming a

test their sights on a slower link

257
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:44,090
and so I just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a point of</font>

258
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,710
you know don't don't allow fast pipes to

259
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:47,480
make you lazy like oh this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is great it</font>

260
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,550
loads faster you know on my dsl

261
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,860
connection but we have to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

262
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:54,319
the people up north who have limited

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,100
internet connectivity or slower internet

264
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:04,070
connectivity so we're always constantly

265
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:05,270
keeping an eye on on page<font color="#CCCCCC"> weight but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

network convince can do some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

267
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:11,930
well specifically ensuring that you have

268
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:14,209
a fat enough pipe to handle large events

269
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,969
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago during the fifa world</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">isp who just saturated their link they</font>

272
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:25,160
had more eyeballs in the link it could

00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,709
handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> frustrating for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

274
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,219
because that's lost revenue lost ad

275
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:33,710
revenue poor experience no users on this

276
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:35,930
particular isp would complain is nothing

277
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:39,110
we could do so it's important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

278
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:41,930
ensure that you do have a pipe big

enough to handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> the handle your your</font>

281
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,569
sure that it supports the two or three

00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:53,210
partial content<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests and this is</font>

283
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:56,090
because on-demand content nowadays is

284
00:13:53,210 --> 00:14:01,340
also delivered using HTTP and it's

285
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:03,410
delivered in chunks so you can cash only

286
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,630
a specific portion of on-demand clip

287

want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a 10 minute clip and I hip</font>

289
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,040
clay and I stopped after five minutes

290
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,980
well that five<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes is only going to</font>

291
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,480
be cached so when user B comes along and

292
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,920
hits play well they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go all</font>

293
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,040
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the origin they can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

294
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,069
load up the first five<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes of the</font>

295
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,630
video and<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the local cache so just</font>

296
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:28,370
double check to make sure that your cash

297
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:31,750
does support this extension of the HTTP

298
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:31,750
protocol and most most do anyways

299
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:44,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">Pierre with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CD ends that's important or</font>

300
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,110
better yet ask them<font color="#E5E5E5"> Akamai limelight</font>

301
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">Brightcove those guys to host their</font>

302
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:57,660
stuff in your data center that gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

303
00:14:49,320 --> 00:15:00,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">the most optimum scenario one little bit</font>

304
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:04,079
of advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wanted to give you guys</font>

305
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:07,290
before I finish the olympic games are

306
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:09,600
coming up it's a you know it's a huge

307
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,360
event there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be lots and lots</font>

308
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,820
of video this year this time<font color="#E5E5E5"> around I've</font>

309
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">been at CBC for six olympic games and</font>

310
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,510
each year<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the bandwidth just grows</font>

311
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:24,709
exponentially and this year's going to

312
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:27,839
be no exception especially with video<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

313
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:30,300
read<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere that YouTube is going to</font>

314
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,990
be handling some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the video for NBC in</font>

315
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,520
the United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's I can only</font>

316
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:39,420
assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic is going to</font>

317
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">be coming to and from from google we</font>

318
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:45,750
deliver all our content using Akamai for

319
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:48,979
video as well so again it's important

320
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:51,120
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do peer with peer with akamai a</font>

321
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:54,630
ticket to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your users have</font>

322
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,250
the best video experience you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

323
00:15:54,630 --> 00:16:02,189
to run to the situation like we did with

324
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:05,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">FIFA with running out of bandwidth it's</font>

325
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,270
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to predict what kind of bandwidth</font>

326
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,779
requirements are going to need<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

327
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:11,370
Olympics I do anticipate that the video

328
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:15,390
bit rates are going to be between<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 and</font>

329
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:17,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">5 megabits so keep that in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mind with you</font>

330
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,910
can do the basic math with the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

331
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,910
users that you have

332
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:30,980
any specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions about CBC or how</font>

333
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,979
how we do how we do things or anything

334
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:46,990
no news is good news I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that got</font>

335
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,810
it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody the mic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay West</font>

336
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:55,930
George Time Warner Cable I will be the

337
00:16:49,810 --> 00:17:00,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">resident Stuckey on this question Akamai</font>

338
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:05,139
supports ipv6 view uh we do via Akamai

339
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:08,530
yes so how come I has is great they are

340
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:12,070
origin right now is still all before we

341
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:13,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to continue to use</font>

342
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:16,270
the v4 origin and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just tell</font>

343
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:20,170
Akamai hey deliver our content using v6

344
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,730
as well we do have that option it's

345
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:25,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking into for</font>

346
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the future it's great for us because we</font>

347
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:30,490
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to roll out a v6</font>

348
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:33,400
infrastructure right away and it allows

349
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:36,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">us to to do you know do testing we can</font>

350
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:40,420
turn it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and off easily by a push of a</font>

351
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:43,840
button really so it's again a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

352
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,670
lot of our limitations or abilities are

353
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,649
solely based on the Akamai portfolio

354
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:53,800
because again everything is served from

355
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:57,340
them right so the question was more when

356
00:17:53,800 --> 00:18:02,250
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you turning it on hmm I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

357
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:04,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">yet it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a priority right now at cbc</font>

358
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:08,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe because all of our eyeballs are</font>

359
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:11,350
still on v4 right we don't see a benefit

360
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:14,560
to turn into doing v6 just yet but as

361
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:18,360
soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> that magic tipping point happens</font>

362
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">then I'm sure we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> switching over</font>
