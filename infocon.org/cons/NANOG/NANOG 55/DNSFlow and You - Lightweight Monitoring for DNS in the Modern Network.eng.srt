1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,479
great thanks guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> and our last talk for</font>

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,830
the session this afternoon is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kyle</font>

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,830
crates on DNS flow

4
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:27,670
thank you

5
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:39,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright good afternoon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone my name</font>

6
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,440
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Joe eggleston from Deep Field</font>

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,419
networks and myself and Kyle are

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,660
actually going to be both talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS flow so I'm first going to be giving</font>

10
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,519
just a brief introduction motivation and

11
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,769
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kyle's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about how he</font>

12
00:00:52,519 --> 00:01:01,040
has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS flow within merits</font>

13
00:00:54,769 --> 00:01:04,309
network so i just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to start out by</font>

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:08,000
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on record as saying that I for one</font>

15
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:09,170
welcome our itu overlords and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,119
thought it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be useful maybe to</font>

17
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,510
start with an analogy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to telecom</font>

18
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,220
networks I mostly I think this analogies

19
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:19,490
you feel because it kind of helps

20
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:22,640
illustrate how this technology is<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow</font>

21
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:26,259
it can be powerful and<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful within the</font>

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,240
internet within an IP network so within

23
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:31,399
telecon telecom networks they have this

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,429
concept of data plate or different

25
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:37,340
planes that the network is built on the

26
00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:39,890
data playing the control plane and the

27
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,319
management plane and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

28
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:46,670
exactly completely apply to an IP

29
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:48,560
network within IP it's in some ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

30
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,490
guess I would argue a lot simpler other

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,039
people maybe would say it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> messy</font>

32
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:57,249
but basically if you want to understand

33
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:59,539
what's going on within the data plane

34
00:01:57,249 --> 00:02:02,109
within a telecom network is really

35
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:05,509
useful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the control plane</font>

36
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:08,478
because that is what gives you the when

37
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:10,130
a user<font color="#E5E5E5"> is dialing the phone the control</font>

38
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,830
plane is what's setting up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

39
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,959
and setting up the call so the control

40
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,430
plane informs you with about what's

41
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,040
going on within the data plane itself

42
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,010
and can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the same thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,290
IP network well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you could</font>

44
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,420
argue that DNS is the closest thing to a

45
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">signaling plane or control plane with an</font>

46
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,190
IP network it's how the user expresses

47
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,560
their intent right now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font>

48
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,439
understand what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the data</font>

49
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,960
plane we have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> use something like</font>

50
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">net flow or its friends</font>

51
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,730
and the terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are incredibly</font>

52
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:48,160
useful but they have their limits I

53
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:52,010
think you get a real power by<font color="#E5E5E5"> combining</font>

54
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:56,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS so the the signaling from the user</font>

55
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:57,799
with the telemetry coming from net from

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the routers and by combining these two</font>

57
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,880
things together you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a whole new</font>

58
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:07,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">world of information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that before was</font>

59
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:10,700
impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS flow what is</font>

60
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,890
it basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a protocol reference</font>

61
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:17,780
implementation for the efficient export

62
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:19,609
of DNS telemetry so to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear the</font>

63
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,850
thing that we're mostly interested in is

64
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:27,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> recursive responses so this is</font>

65
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:31,609
sitting south of the recursive resolver

66
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:35,750
and there is related work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

67
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:39,490
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SI è ì óù ç passive DNS work</font>

68
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,720
which primarily uses iterative responses

69
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:43,340
for us we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main</font>

70
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,109
operational benefit actually comes from

71
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,660
looking at the recursive responses and

72
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:49,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the goal from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS flow the thing I'm</font>

73
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:54,109
most interested in is getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

74
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:55,609
access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this data and so the problem</font>

75
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now is that there's not really an</font>

76
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:02,750
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accesses recursive</font>

77
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:05,930
responses you can enable I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> it not</font>

78
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:09,140
go quite yet you can enable syslog on a

79
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:11,120
router or I'm sorry syslog on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

80
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,630
server but that will pretty much crush

81
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,360
the server and beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's not</font>

82
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:21,250
really any open standardized way to get

83
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:25,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">this information out so the first</font>

84
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:28,070
challenge that or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first issue that</font>

85
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,620
most people come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with is the scale of</font>

86
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:33,349
the data and I think we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty</font>

87
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,270
good answer for this and Kyle actually

88
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,310
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the results he has illustrates</font>

89
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,200
it even better<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the data is</font>

90
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,350
incredibly redundant so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy</font>

91
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,020
to come up with cheap and easy ways to

92
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,400
compress this you can right off the bat

93
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,659
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> users are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the same thing</font>

94
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">over and over and over again you only</font>

95
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,000
have to see WWE

96
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,410
calm so many times before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know or</font>

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,010
you can come up with a way to compress

98
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:59,320
that really easily so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 to</font>

99
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 compression ratios based on the data</font>

100
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,380
we have and with just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit more</font>

101
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,140
cleverness you can go even further<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

102
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so our status we're cool so we're</font>

103
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">on github you can join us there if</font>

104
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,500
you're interested you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can download the</font>

105
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:17,380
initial version right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and play with</font>

106
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:22,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">it it's really simple a couple hundred</font>

107
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:25,900
lines of an CC has flow like output the

108
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:27,790
upcoming version will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be using IP fix</font>

109
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,179
just to make it easy to interoperate

110
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:33,430
with the current set of tools will have

111
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,370
support for the compression and sampling

112
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:40,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">built-in and it's currently deployed in</font>

113
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:42,910
several production networks just in case

114
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,670
wasn't clear from before where we were

115
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,530
talking about deploying this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

116
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,750
either you could do it on recursive

117
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,330
resolver itself and we have some ongoing

118
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,030
discussions with some of the commercial

119
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS servers about implementing a plug-in</font>

120
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:00,369
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those servers or if you have a span</font>

121
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:03,670
or me report that can grab this traffic

122
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:06,220
and send it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vm in your cloud or</font>

123
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:13,870
commodity<font color="#CCCCCC"> pc you could run the code</font>

124
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:19,480
there oops<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yep and with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I will</font>

125
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:22,380
turn it over to Kyle so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

126
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,260
briefly<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a simple operational</font>

127
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,760
thing that you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the data so</font>

128
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,460
first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've tried to do is come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

129
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">with something that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

130
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,900
who are running<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks and as you run</font>

131
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,360
a network if you run your own recursive

132
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,280
resolver you sit between your customers

133
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,670
and that resolver and you can help them

134
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:45,099
by using these<font color="#E5E5E5"> black lists to identify</font>

135
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,590
fishing activity if you're recording all

136
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the responses from your resolver you</font>

137
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,760
can throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that into a database which we</font>

138
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:55,270
did and then run nightly queries to

139
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,550
report which clients were fished and by

140
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,859
which domains and you can automate<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

141
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:04,139
to do

142
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:06,479
a run nightly so let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

143
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:10,520
data itself we wanted to characterize

144
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:13,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS to IP mappings as we observe them</font>

145
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,688
there are two basic types of entries

146
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,969
that we found largely dynamic mappings

147
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:21,090
meaning things that change frequently or

148
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:24,659
had many named IP mappings and then

149
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,489
largely static<font color="#E5E5E5"> name IP mappings that</font>

150
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:28,710
didn't change across the period of

151
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,379
observation which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> three weeks after</font>

152
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first seven days the rate of growth</font>

153
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:37,710
flattened out quite a bit as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

154
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:40,109
in the graph and it approaches roughly

155
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:46,938
constant there's a small diurnal shift

156
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:49,050
but so again two major contributors five

157
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:56,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">tlds account for ninety percent of the</font>

158
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:58,080
data 380 LDS so there are very few

159
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:02,330
domains that have a large number of

160
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,729
named IP mappings the 20 largest have

161
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:07,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">forty-three percent of all of the pairs</font>

162
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:09,508
although ninety-eight percent of the

163
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:15,360
domains the second-level domains that we

164
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:19,650
examined had fewer than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 named IP</font>

165
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,810
pairs so i guess the in summary very few

166
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:25,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a really large number of named IP</font>

167
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:27,240
mappings also meaning that very few were

168
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:29,520
extremely dynamic but the ones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

169
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,690
were very dynamic the top eight had

170
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:37,039
10,000 entries each and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now what we</font>

171
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:40,500
did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we looked at the distribution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

172
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:45,029
unique IPS across the set of name IP

173
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:49,199
mappings so we just pointed out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

174
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:51,209
of large dynamic services where there's

175
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:53,640
a pointer so you can see cloud front

176
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:59,369
right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> has about a hundred and sorry</font>

177
00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:02,970
about 80,000 name<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Peter ip's that's</font>

178
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:05,190
8,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I'm sorry and then the last</font>

179
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:10,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing we did was looked at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name IP pairs</font>

180
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:12,300
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> clasped the the into name and IP</font>

181
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:16,050
pairs so

182
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:18,870
across each / 8 how many name IP

183
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,280
mappings did it have in that / 8 so you

184
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:24,240
can see that cloud front is a major

185
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:27,720
contributor with around 52,000 name IP

186
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,240
mappings and a couple of other fairly

187
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,770
well-known services so that's all of the

188
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,380
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I have to go through does</font>

189
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:42,810
anybody have any questions about<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

190
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:57,090
data or implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right well</font>

191
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:59,189
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much thanks all right</font>

192
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,690
thanks very much folks that about<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

193
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">it for the session just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick reminder</font>

194
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:06,390
we do have a break now and then not long

195
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,640
after that there is the DNS track which

196
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:11,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">is in I believe also in here in the</font>

197
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,590
ballroom starting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 430 and don't</font>

198
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">forget there's also a social tonight</font>

199
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:19,590
seven o'clock at the telus world of

200
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:23,630
science thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much oh and please</font>

201
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,630
fill out your surveys thank you

202
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:29,758
you
