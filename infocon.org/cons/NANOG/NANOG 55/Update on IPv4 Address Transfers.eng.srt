00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,579
information first here's what's been

19
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,260
transferred so far these are parties who

20
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,510
have paid to transfer their rights to

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,120
address space to another party the

22
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,539
recipient must be qualified<font color="#CCCCCC"> must need</font>

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,120
the address space this is almost all of

24
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,049
them it updates pretty frequently you'll

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,548

address<font color="#E5E5E5"> space transfers it to someone</font>

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,890
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs the address space the one who</font>

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:20,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs it under our present policies up</font>

31
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,049
to your two year running demand based on

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">your run rate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can receive</font>

33
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,700
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting because well</font>

34
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,880
we're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of address space in in</font>

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,880
the region but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we still have it we issue</font>

36
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,199
address space once you qualify so the

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea that we're willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give you</font>

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,920
address space but instead you went out

39
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,610
bought the rights to someone else is

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,610
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird now a couple of details we</font>

41
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,280
issue in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90 day increments and we issue</font>

42
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,130
you put you through a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> work to</font>

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,409
qualify to get 90 days worth of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

44
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,740
ring and then you come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 90 days</font>

45
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,479
and you do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again that's a lot of work</font>

46
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:00,890
some people think that it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth</font>

47
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,570
instead going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the market additionally</font>

48
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,530
90 days 90 days 90 days<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some point</font>

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,439
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to say</font>

50
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,410
we're out sorry you can transfer up to

51
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,420
two years of address space so for some

52
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,500
people that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> something if you're</font>

53
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">building on a network you</font>

54
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,660
want a number the entire network not

just the half<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you got built in the</font>

56
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,799
next eight months so being able to get

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,140
the address<font color="#CCCCCC"> space and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't address plan</font>

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,340
is useful there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who have</font>

59
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,730
learned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's this new thing</font>

60
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:34,860
called v6 I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> on world ipv6 launch day</font>

61
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,989
but forgot that they had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan for</font>

62
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:41,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and think they need a little more</font>

63
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:43,260
room with v4 before they take the plunge

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,790
so we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the market</font>

65
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:50,399
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting because really this is</font>

66
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,380
opportunistic based the people who have

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,760
v4 address space who are making it

68
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:58,560

69
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,260

Microsoft<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron was notified about it</font>

and we said I'm sorry we can't approve

86
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,680
this because it has to meet our policy

87
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,959
luckily we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

there are transfers going on

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,380
predominantly bankruptcy estates we have

I will tell you if you fall qualify we

104
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,370
will update the database will<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

105

the transaction if you don't well you

106
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,039
have some interesting too

107
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,389
and those court systems for that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

choice we're going to run the database

111
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,940
ago in to the policies you guys set so

112
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,660
why wouldn't we approve a transfer

113
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,850
transferred to a party without any

114

these because they look valuable

00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,370
transfer two blocks other than the

the registry says we have that happen

occasionally a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

companies that have creatively

126
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,138
discovered that there's an address block

127
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,880
that they can assert ownership of

128
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:20,099
because it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> registered to Bill Smith</font>

129
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,199
and they find a bill smith in that town

130
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:25,889
and they get a copy of his driver's

131

00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:01,530
this is the unfortunate<font color="#CCCCCC"> one because</font>

147
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:03,810
everyone's trying to do the right thing

148
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,219
and someone says I really want that 14

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,599
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will clear us for two years and</font>

150
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">this way I don't worry about running out</font>

151
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:11,610
next year and it turns out they don't

152
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,369
qualify for 14 they qualify for 16 and

153
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,380
that's kind of ugly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there may be</font>

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,199
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paperwork there may be a lot of</font>

158
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,840
what you can transfer we can actually

159
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you that certification up front but</font>

160
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,888
if you do it after the fact there's a

161
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:34,380
risk and then request a transfer blocks

the policy get edited in

call so we held<font color="#E5E5E5"> it over for consultation</font>

167
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,940
which we held in the Vancouver actually

168
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,630
and that was completed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy plus</font>

169
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:54,949
an additional policy to change the NRI

170
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,990
transfer policy to have certain

171
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:58,250
protections so once you transferred you

172
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,860
couldn't go get more space and do it

173
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">again all of those were recommended by</font>

174
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,410
the AC and actually in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning's</font>

175
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,270
board call were all ratified so we will

176
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,510
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in the next several months</font>

177
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,250
a in Terraria transfer policy that's

178
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:15,169
implemented and that will probably

179
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">change things a bit because a lot of the</font>

180
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:18,320
people worried about this stuff are

presently in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the asia-pacific region</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">where they ran out we have not run out</font>

183
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,550
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to run out we're actually</font>

184
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,010
seeing an increase in ipv4 requests I

185
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,190
expect right now we're probably on an

186
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:34,969
early two thousand thirteen or summer

187
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:36,620
2013 run<font color="#E5E5E5"> out schedule but the fact of</font>

188
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,350
the matter is that it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sooner it</font>

189
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,729
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be later but parties outside the</font>

dealing this with a while and they've

who have pre-qualified to receive a

205
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:17,630
they're saying they could renumber out

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:19,490
of if they were paid there's a listing

207

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the AC has asked the same question</font>

is 137 60 yeah just with these new

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,779
policies you guys had ratified is that

257
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,290
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difference on one</font>

258
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:46,490
ipv4 depletion takes place and if if it

259
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,569
doesn't oh so you're saying it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

260
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,149
going to make much of a difference at

261
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:51,829
all it<font color="#CCCCCC"> should not because there is the</font>

262
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,779
potential that a lot of people with a

263
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:55,519
lot of money over in Asia could wind up

264
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:58,939
buying a lot of IP blocks and that could

265
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">perhaps change when ipv4 is exhausted</font>

266
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,069
North America affecting sort of so don't

267
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:07,880
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to adopt ipv6 yep there is</font>

268
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:09,920
a window where a lot of people

from people today who have address

00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">people today a year from now could</font>

00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:19,040
qualify<font color="#E5E5E5"> for more address blocks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:59,380
members and they can request<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

288
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,500
produce a certificate for their

289
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:07,400
resources and sign rowa can they request

290
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:09,830
that you issue a certificate for someone

291
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,970
to whom they intend to allocate a

292
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:16,160
portion of their space<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rpi services</font>

293
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,050
for addresses held by people in the

294
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:23,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">region that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are currently the holder of</font>

295
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:25,910
those addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you've talked</font>

296
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:29,060
about this was about transfer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mark</font>

297
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:31,370
talked about working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transfer</font>

298
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,579
policy and how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be played out</font>

299
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:37,280
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpki I understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're in</font>

300
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:40,490
Terraria are as you know the policy is

301
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:43,760
in firm yet and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on it</font>

302
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:48,620
will the policy be the same in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> air</font>

303
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:51,890
in region as it is between<font color="#E5E5E5"> regions</font>

304
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:55,690
horrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're beasts let me be clear</font>

305
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:58,430
so the inter re our transfer policy was

306
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,870
considered by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community recommended</font>

307
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,420
by the Advisory Council and ratified by

308
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:05,270
the Aaron board like I said right now

309
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,459
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be an implementation</font>

310
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:09,290
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inter re our transfer policy in</font>

311
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,540
Terraria our transfers have some

312
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:16,069
interesting implications first this

313
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:20,540
thing called<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dns has reverse inverse</font>

314
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:21,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">dns reverse dns was not based on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

315
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,719
idea that you could

316
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,930
ice an address block at any given

317
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,270
boundary and so the inadar management

318
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,859
and how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens needs to be paid</font>

319
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:33,350
attention to the IRS need to work that

320
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,810
out additionally our<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki is the same way</font>

321
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,210
obviously you slice off a piece of rpki

322
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:41,630
space<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's and you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to issue assert</font>

323
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:43,580
to it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible now there are two</font>

324
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,620
are IRS involved in the certification

325
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:48,980
path so we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have come up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

326
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,570
architecture for that and because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> er</font>

327
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,450
ers are knowledgeable but we're not

328
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:55,430
totally knowledgeable we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

329
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">get folks from the IETF to look at that</font>

330
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:01,459
folks like Randy and yourself to make

331
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,980
sure to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure it's under shadow to</font>

332
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:07,520
our IRS involved in a certification pad

333
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:10,340
so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes up is if a</font>

334
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:15,860
block<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> currently served by one</font>

335
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:18,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">rir has a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> / 8 level managed by an AR AR</font>

336
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:21,440
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a / 24 transferred to another region</font>

337
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:24,280
does the certificate for that / 24 the

338
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,780
swing point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I Anna right so</font>

339
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,540
document to help it if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't get</font>

340
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:31,100
your politics right oh sorry so Thank

341
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,199
You Randy so what we'd like to do is

342
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I think the document how that</font>

343
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,640
happens in the swing points and get it

344
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:40,790
in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the IETF so they can say yes</font>

345
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,220
this is I did that for years ago yes

346
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,410
Randy it's your resource to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

347
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,480
community and truly wonderful now we'd

348
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:51,020
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the IRS on the same page as</font>

349
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:54,380
that and get approval<font color="#E5E5E5"> part okay it is a</font>

350
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:58,910
political issue as Randy notes so

351
00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:01,850
obviously if I have an interest if there

352
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:06,319
are rpki architectural issues that need

353
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:08,240
to get worked out then the IETF the last

354
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,670
time I tracked icity the last time i

355
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">checked the rirs had committed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

356
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,990
documenting what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposed to do and</font>

357
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:17,480
bringing it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF and that was two</font>

358
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,430
months ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there was a time many</font>

359
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago when there was a lot of</font>

360
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:24,589
discussion about how transfers would

361
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:27,730
work in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpki I know that there are</font>

362
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:31,060
lots of issues there yes indeed

363
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,769
in the last question I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to</font>

364
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:36,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there was no one behind me the</font>

365
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:39,130
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> question did I hear a projected</font>

366
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:43,180
time that the RPK I would be in

367
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:45,610
production mode of early next year I

368
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,660
thought that that wasn't i was talking

369
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">about transfers that would have been a</font>

370
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,779
March presentation yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the</font>

371
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:55,660
answer is though that we are having a

372
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:57,760
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work being done particularly with</font>

373
00:15:55,660 --> 00:16:00,880
respect to our hsm and non-repudiation

374
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:04,410
and this is causing our dates to be at

375
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,699
risk we do intend to have hosted our pki

376
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,519
we're trying to aim for that to be out

377
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:12,699
shortly like this summer oh they

378
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,170
delegated<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so delegated might take a</font>

379
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:16,630
little bit of work we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font>

380
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:21,550
that within the year yes okay okay thank

381
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:23,019
you Thank You Martin yes I think I'm the

382
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:26,139
last pass Martin lady hurricane electric

383
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:27,730
today is world ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> launch and I notice</font>

384
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:30,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're talking about transfer policy but</font>

385
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,019
it is it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> before it doesn't have</font>

386
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">these snakes there's a phenomenal amount</font>

387
00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:36,910
of v6 space the transfer market could be

388
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,800
enormous I said the whole policy should

389
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,170
be updated today because it should be

390
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">beep or b6 compatible that's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

391
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,010
comment thank you wonderful actually

392
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,420
this came up because one of the things

393
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,569
that happen in the Aaron region is

394
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:51,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion of asn transfers and there's</font>

395
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:53,079
policy that was recommended<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that and</font>

396
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,149
adopted so if you can transfer v4

397
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:59,380
numbers you can transfer<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs biking it</font>

398
00:16:55,149 --> 00:17:01,029
transfer v6 you might need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work to</font>

399
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sure when creating the unified</font>

400
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:06,520
field theory of number transfer that you

401
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:08,679
handle all the details and so I don't

402
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,500
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community wants that or if</font>

403
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:15,010
the AC will pick it up but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do WWE</font>

404
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:17,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">Arnett put a policy proposal in thank</font>

405
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,579
you and in the spirit of this question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

406
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,319
should point out earlier when you

407
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned that you mentioned that</font>

408
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,250
bankruptcy and whether a / 32 is

409
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:26,168
transferable again you were not v6

410
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:31,620
compliant on that statement that's right
