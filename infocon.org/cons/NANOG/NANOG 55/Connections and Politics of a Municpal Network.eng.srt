talks or drink beer at the Bering gear

19
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:09,510
of late I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,309
sort of grassroots project that we've

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:15,960
done at the city<font color="#CCCCCC"> of San Francisco much</font>

22
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,610
unknown to most of San Francisco and

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,408
much unknown too much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> city government</font>

24
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is actually somewhat of a</font>

25
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:25,049
grassroots thing that we did with like

26
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,149
zero money and big impact and I want to

27
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">sort of cover how we did that and how we</font>

28
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,770
sort of got around a lot of the politics

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">of San Francisco to do that quickie a</font>

30
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:38,310
little background there was about 19<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs</font>

31
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,649
be 2006 there was this bright idea by

32
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,799
mayor gavin newsom who is now our

33
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,079
lieutenant governor instea<font color="#E5E5E5"> California to</font>

34
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,439
do this blanket of Wi-Fi all through<font color="#E5E5E5"> San</font>

35
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Francisco and he was basically just sort</font>

36
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,360
of like mood by a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple people at</font>

37
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,219
Google Earth link and gave that project

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,719
to them unfortunately it was rather

39
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:03,030
technically poor and it was a it was

40
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,309
also politically executed in the fact

41
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,020
that he<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of ran this down most of</font>

42
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,660
the government's throat and they sort of

43
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,420
kicked back when I saw it I said oh my

44
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,950
god this thing's a pile of crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

45
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,890
actually fought against<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and delayed</font>

46
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,760
it for quite a while there but what

47
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:23,130
happened is during this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time is that</font>

48
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google or Mayor Newsom actually tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

49
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,870
put a proposition on the ballot to try

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,310
to force the hand of most of the

51
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,770
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to push this thing</font>

52
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,770
through there was a resounding success

53
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:38,040
that yes the public voted<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing in</font>

54
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:40,170
and so he basically had to go forward

55
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">with it somehow but in the second here</font>

56
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,458
during this time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were noticing</font>

57
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,350
that this abomination called Google

58
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,670
Earth like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wireless was going forward I</font>

59
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:49,500
discovered there was a bunch of fiber

60
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,839
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was laying in the ground in san</font>

61
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,239
francisco and probably most people knew

62
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,239
this already but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't know the size</font>

63
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,459
and scale of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it was enormous amount</font>

64
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,430
of what the city of san<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco had pulled</font>

65
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:06,170
in for other projects what the city of

66
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:09,239
San<font color="#E5E5E5"> Francisco had basically gotten</font>

67
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:13,679
abandoned to them in place by thank God

68
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:16,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">2000 the the dive on the on the</font>

69
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,440
financials during that time so I was

70
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,060
saying she instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of using 802 11 to do</font>

71
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,829
backhaul to try to do this wireless

72
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,570
stuff why don't we start putting fiber

73
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,690
into every single street address in San

74
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">Francisco the main reason is and</font>

75
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,340
everybody knows this here is that last

76
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,230
mile cost is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big bottleneck at one</font>

77
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,540
point when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we started little garden</font>

78
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:40,560
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was an ISP that I and a number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

79
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,540
other people started back in 90 or so

80
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,180
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we were paying Rick</font>

81
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,250
Adams about<font color="#E5E5E5"> five to six thousand dollars</font>

82
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,600
a month<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 ones worth of bandwidth and</font>

83
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,209
it was still costing us about five

84
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,299
hundred dollars to get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our place</font>

85
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:56,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the t1 so the transit costs at that</font>

86
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,069
point were about ninety-five percent of

87
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:02,700
the costs now at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point as you know</font>

88
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:04,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">transit is in the single digits and but</font>

89
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,810
the last mile is still hundreds of

90
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,310
dollars so now the last mile is like

91
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,160
ninety-eight percent of the cost of

92
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,560
getting bandwidth at your location so to

93
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,840
speak at what i call the proposal and so

94
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,250
I and a number of other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt</font>

95
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,560
Peterson being one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those people in</font>

96
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,539
such crafted this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of business model</font>

97
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,849
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we sent to the city of San</font>

98
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:25,530
Francisco during the RFC phase<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

99
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:28,800
got forced into doing

100
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,630
because it was shown<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they really</font>

101
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't go through the proper process of</font>

102
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:36,270
handing this over to earthling and what

103
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,359
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a proposal to say let's</font>

104
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">just work on the OSI layers and say how</font>

105
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,350
the financials<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked the same way this</font>

106
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,330
is much like you'd see any other layer

107
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">one layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two layer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 provider work on</font>

108
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,719
but this is all new to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> city of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> San</font>

109
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,810
Francisco they<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't quite figured</font>

110
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,610
this thing out yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in the case layer</font>

111
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,200
one would be the city of San<font color="#E5E5E5"> Francisco</font>

112
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,850
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> would basically dig up the streets</font>

113
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">they fuse the fire were they know how to</font>

114
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,020
dig up streets they do that really well

115
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,870
they putting them back together is

116
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,539
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem the data link should be</font>

117
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,900
run by some sort of layer 2 provider

118
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,660
possibly a non-profit or not-for-profit

119
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:15,060
there's two different things there and

120
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,680
then the layer 3 provider is not touched

121
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,419
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the city of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> San Francisco at all that</font>

122
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,880
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be any Tom Dick or Harry 'it that</font>

123
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:23,099
would show up at a data center so in

124
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,330
essence what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens is as a resident or</font>

125
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,050
business owner in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the city of San</font>

126
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:30,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">Francisco much like you would go to</font>

127
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:33,240
looking glass or some other fiber

128
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:34,979
manufacturer you would say I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

129
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,900
backhaul to 200<font color="#CCCCCC"> Paul and I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

130
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:40,260
connect to some of the layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 provider</font>

131
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,419
so I again as a resident say gee I'd

132
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,479
like to connect to sonic net I call

133
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,789
sonic net they said oh sure ya will

134
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,849
provide you bandwidth and they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

135
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:54,750
sort of virtual private network or late

136
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,700
VLAN to my place and start selling<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as</font>

137
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,960
bandwidth to me and then they pay the

138
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:02,159
city of<font color="#E5E5E5"> San Francisco the layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

139
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,020
provider for that pipe so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

140
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">described the money how it flows down</font>

141
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack the problem is is that we're</font>

142
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,800
we aren't just dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these two</font>

143
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,520
layers are these three layers and this

144
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,229
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously this is a famous extended</font>

145
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,010
OSI stack and this is the one I kind of

146
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:21,900
took a picture off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISC's t-shirt the</font>

147
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,070
problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is those two other layers of</font>

148
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,729
the financial and political and that's

149
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:28,830
the ones that that get get us and trying

150
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:30,630
to deploy this sort of thing as we had

151
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,700
no money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have politics in the</font>

152
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,490
city<font color="#E5E5E5"> of San Francisco so as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned</font>

153
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">I did a lot of</font>

154
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,759
activity to try to stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing I</font>

155
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">went with the support of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Supervisors and</font>

156
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">said this is the reason you shouldn't be</font>

158
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,949
like privacy concerns technical concerns

159
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,270
things like that so when the finally

160
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,470
when Google<font color="#CCCCCC"> Earthlings sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of realized</font>

161
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,750
that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how to do this</font>

162
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,699
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they pulled out they actually did a</font>

163
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,229
deployment in Philadelphia and they

164
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:56,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably pulled out and said key you</font>

165
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:57,900
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't quite figured how to do</font>

166
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,719
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing let's not do cities I'm</font>

167
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,190
Jessica it's just going to be a pile of

168
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,430
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we would have to step</font>

169
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,539
into they pulled out as anchor<font color="#CCCCCC"> teneyck I</font>

170
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,120
get this call from the city<font color="#E5E5E5"> of San</font>

171
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:10,919
Francisco them saying okay you screwed

172
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,599
us over Tim what do we do now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

173
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:16,289
well remember that proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sent to</font>

174
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:18,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">you why don't you start putting fiber</font>

175
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:20,400
into places like housing developments

176
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,699
you do a couple things with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

177
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,169
address digital divide issues you don't

178
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,550
have to worry about an SLA right now you

179
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:29,698
know if the thing goes down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

180
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,110
free oh well but you start getting sort

181
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like gaining the expertise of what</font>

182
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,099
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take to at least get these</font>

183
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,810
fiber into some of these buildings and

184
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:38,520
housing developments are probably a good

185
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,430
start in that and actually goods makes

186
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:46,590
good press as well well apparently they

187
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:49,680
took me seriously on that so what

188
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,719
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we ended up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> putting in fiber</font>

189
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,009
to about 40 plus housing developments

190
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:55,590
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about that in a second</font>

191
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:57,330
here but one thing is that in order to

192
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:00,810
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do that you obviously need</font>

193
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:02,280
switches dear things like that we didn't

194
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,580
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any funding to be able to do that</font>

195
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,440
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 since there was</font>

196
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,430
there was no funding we were expecting

197
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,960
the funding to come from google

198
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">Earthling for a lot of this stuff and</font>

199
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,229
the city of<font color="#E5E5E5"> San Francisco has always</font>

200
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,050
been one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things that has run in</font>

201
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:17,849
the red what they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a hard this one</font>

202
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,610
guy win by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Mike Mike McCarthy to</font>

203
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:22,409
project manage it mike is actually an

204
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,900
old friend he's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on other</font>

205
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:27,780
places with companies like one economy

206
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,219
and such to try to put fiber or at least

207
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,360
bandwidth into housing developments in

208
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:34,679
the past so there was no money<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what</font>

209
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,089
we had to do is we had a sort of big

210
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,760
borrow a steal a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

211
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:41,669
infrastructure to put it in one of the

212
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,828
ways creative ways to do this is there's

213
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:46,949
an organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TechSoup</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TechSoup</font>

214
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:49,180
gets donation in san Cisco Cisco donates

215
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:51,189
to them and then TechSoup

216
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,380
is like ten percent of what the retail

217
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,810
cost is for a switch we<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually will</font>

218
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,970
have a nonprofit that follows in the

219
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">appropriate conditions that that Cisco</font>

220
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,810
or whoever else has for that gear

221
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:03,279
they'll buy the gear they'll put it into

222
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,550
a housing development because the

223
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,170
nonprofit usually will exist there for

224
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:11,620
employment and helping and things like

225
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,599
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then they and then we manage</font>

226
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,130
the switch so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually built this</font>

227
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,640
whole thing with just switches and fiber

228
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,470
for actually zero cost or at least sunk

229
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,689
costs that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already had with the city</font>

230
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">of San Francisco so surplus fiber was</font>

231
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,100
supplied by the city monitoring routing

232
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,810
and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been donated and</font>

233
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,550
I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that a little bit and the</font>

234
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,770
technical labor is all been free as well

235
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's like Matt Peterson I Steve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Giffords</font>

236
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:38,350
actually been helping out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

237
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,760
on this thing in some cases we actually

238
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,320
did have a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the San</font>

239
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,189
Francisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> Housing Authority did actually</font>

240
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,899
with new deployments put in some decent

241
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,570
copper infrastructure almost this is

242
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:51,310
actually cat5 as was the cat<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 so we</font>

243
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:55,120
can't run one gig<font color="#E5E5E5"> on some of this stuff</font>

244
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:57,069
but this is a typical install for some

245
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,540
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-end installations we have at</font>

246
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:03,279
a housing development called<font color="#CCCCCC"> lindsay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

247
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:05,260
gardens this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the main mdf you can see</font>

248
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,570
in the back there the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single-mode</font>

249
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:10,000
that's going up to one of our cisco 29

250
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:13,480
60s again really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not highest which is</font>

251
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,220
but they work and then these go off to a

252
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,520
bunch of other 29 60s and such as our

253
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:21,100
action switches and such this is a floor

254
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,500
plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> so to speak of all the buildings at</font>

255
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,029
two of alessia gardens so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know</font>

256
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you could see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if that will but in the</font>

257
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:29,620
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the upper</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right-hand corner</font>

258
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:31,870
there that's where that that picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

259
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,430
taken and then there is basically a sort

260
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,680
of daisy chain of these little<font color="#E5E5E5"> red lines</font>

261
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,260
which are gig gig drops to each one of

262
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,910
the buildings and then in theory each

263
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,500
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just plug into their</font>

264
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,230
apartment unit and get one gig

265
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,709
symmetrical it's shared but it's still

266
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">pretty decent this is an installation on</font>

267
00:10:47,709 --> 00:10:51,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside of one of those buildings</font>

268
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:55,360
this is an access which goes into a

269
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,279
standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> neiman box nema box in a lot of</font>

270
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">locations we couldn't do fiber and so</font>

271
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,430
what we've done is I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

272
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,939
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the San</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Francisco there's a</font>

273
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,988
couple high heels there

274
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:10,309
one there's a place called<font color="#E5E5E5"> sutro tower</font>

275
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:12,109
big tall tower big big spiky<font color="#E5E5E5"> 33 things</font>

276
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:13,699
called antennas up there and then

277
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:16,579
there's a couple antennas that are next

278
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:17,929
to that place<font color="#E5E5E5"> called twin peaks and so</font>

279
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:21,709
what we've done is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we put up standards</font>

280
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:24,858
of ubiquity sector antennas and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

281
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:27,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">around 20 to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 Meg's or so to each one</font>

282
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:30,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these sites through a backhaul this</font>

283
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:33,439
is a site that's in in the castro

285
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:38,029
bridge that's pointing up to not the big

286
00:11:36,289 --> 00:11:40,069
tall thing but the antennas just the

287
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:42,739
left there on the horizon there that's

288
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:45,498
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twin Peaks is and this actually</font>

289
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:47,059
works pretty well that actually goes to

290
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:48,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a cheaper switch so it's</font>

291
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:50,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a standard little neck here because</font>

292
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:52,039
we only have like three access<font color="#E5E5E5"> points</font>

293
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:53,209
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the plug on the bottom which</font>

294
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:55,339
goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Nana bridge and then the</font>

295
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:57,738
three got the cables go to the access

296
00:11:55,339 --> 00:12:02,749

is out there on this network at this

304

<font color="#E5E5E5">point because of that we have a number</font>

308
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:32,359
fiber networks that there where you're

309
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:38,449
going to have cuts occasionally and we

310
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:40,129
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have cuts the city tends to thinking</font>

311
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:41,959
that they're the only customer of this

312
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:43,369
fiber it just cuts willy-nilly and then

313
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:46,579
all of a sudden will have a kadai outage

314
00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:48,589
even though we have a main ring that

315

still doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover some laterals and</font>

316
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:55,159
such we have them<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so layer two</font>

317
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:57,409
issues when they first started<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

gigantic VLAN this is all on VLAN 1 so

320
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:05,359
if anybody knows dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with customers</font>

321
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:07,459
that means that you anybody plugging in

their comcast router all the Gulf of

323
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:12,858
that sudden becomes the main router for

324
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:14,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network bad thing so we had to do</font>

325
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:17,710
things like turn on dhcp snooping

326
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,800
somehow isolate these these customers

327
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:22,300
from each other and with zero<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause so</font>

these are none of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these switches out</font>

329
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,630
there layer three supporting we've

330
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:29,440
actually had to bring these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things all</font>

331
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:31,930
back to a bunch of vlans and bring them

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,080
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a couple beach I think it's</font>

has its own problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so for instance</font>

00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:55,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">ubiquity runs a sort of a pseudo master</font>

339
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:59,290
sort of thing called WDS and what

340
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:01,000
happens is we've seen those boxes out

341
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:03,640
there actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> start proxying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> announced</font>

343
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,530
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you run one gigantic won't VLAN</font>

344
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:10,959
out there all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tiny little</font>

00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:14,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">ubiquity router or radio out there is</font>

00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,870
now announcing the mac address for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

347
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,060

348
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,830
starts going back to some other some

349
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,939
other box its way out on the edge there

350
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:28,840
this is all not good of course spanning

351
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:30,460
tree has its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems trying to tune</font>

352
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,250
something with this large of a network

353
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,810
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem we've had a tweak on that</font>

354
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not going to go cover that too much</font>

355
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:40,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody knows problems of spanning</font>

356
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:43,300
tree so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do this without</font>

357
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:47,439
getting spending<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of bucks on layer</font>

358
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:49,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">3 enabled switches and such so we've had</font>

359
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,770
a segment a lot of this stuff out we're

360
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,950
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to segment a lot of this stuff</font>

361
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:57,939
out by basically putting in IP 3i IP

362
00:14:53,950 --> 00:15:00,610
routing some of these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> like mikrotik</font>

363
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,920
boxes some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we're actually</font>

364
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:06,850
getting some layer 3 switches out there

365
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,380
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like little so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris boxes and</font>

366
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:12,850
things like that it's and this doesn't

367
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:14,320
scale too much but we're learning so

368
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,640
here's an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's</font>

369
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,950
any vendors out there that would like to

370
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:23,590
sort of show up<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> micro tech we'd love</font>

371
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:26,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk to you it's pretty easy so layer</font>

372
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:28,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">3 the goal on this is not so much to be</font>

373
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,310
a sort of a community network

374
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,719
say but we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make this</font>

375
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,959
sustainable we want to make this a

376
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,540
commercial<font color="#E5E5E5"> network as i said earlier</font>

377
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:38,740
doing the the nonprofit the the the

378
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,150
housing developments as such was

379
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:44,730
basically a way or to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> our toe in the</font>

380
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:48,990
water<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get some ideas on this so</font>

381
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:52,630
let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to skip that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

382
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was jumping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead sorry</font>

383
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,380
so layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three was basically the fact</font>

384
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,200
that we're we're having<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems with</font>

385
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,120
internet archive<font color="#E5E5E5"> uptime and such who's</font>

386
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,590
dis applying the bandwidth layer four

387
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,240
through seven problems are basically

388
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">custom with support so if you get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

389
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,160
housing developments you're usually

390
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,350
getting into folks that have rather

391
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">crusty and old laptops and things like</font>

392
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,980
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need some sort of</font>

393
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,890
customer support on this thing and

394
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,210
anybody runs an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP knows especially</font>

395
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,220
during the days of the old trumpet

396
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,020
winsock and things like that is how what

397
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,290
it takes to sort of like support

398
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:28,210
customers on old<font color="#CCCCCC"> crusty laptops and</font>

399
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,099
platforms and such<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're so we're</font>

400
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:33,250
engaging other organizations like City

401
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,590
College has their own technical of tech

402
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,390
sort of track that that we're training

403
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,250
those people up to have them try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

404
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,319
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take over and sort of run around</font>

405
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:45,670
housing developments and give support on

406
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:47,680
this the end result is the work actually

407
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:51,430
started with fireable deployment and

408
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,260
early oh aight<font color="#CCCCCC"> san francisco housing</font>

409
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:56,170
authorities spent around quarter million

410
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,730
dollars on mainly radios that we could

411
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,510
put on these at these locations as well

412
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:03,010
as some of that wiring that you saw so

413
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,690
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those housing</font>

414
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:06,640
developments will have radios up and

415
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,830
then neighbors can actually plug in and

416
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,360
connect so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of folks that</font>

417
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,619
actually have like the little nano

418
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,879
bridges and connect to the housing

419
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:16,270
development and get free bandwidth that

420
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,610
way we finished up lysing the 40 housing

424
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:27,490
15,000 customers are plugged in at the

425
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,080
same time but we do see<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably around</font>

426
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:32,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand or two thousand customers</font>

428
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,250
access is they can connect anywhere

429
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,140
between 10 to maybe a thousand megabits

430
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,400
we normally are enough

431
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,920
show you one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic graphs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

432
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:50,230
we usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> are pushing around 200 megs</font>

433
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:51,310
or so on this network let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh one</font>

434
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we're doing is</font>

go someplace you plug it in it auto

447
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,900
configures and then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this to</font>

thing done with them leaving we actually

481
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,379
lost a little bit of direction and we

482
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">needed some rudder on that there's a guy</font>

Matt John Walton<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is our new cio and</font>

00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,110
he's taking more of the reins to be able

<font color="#E5E5E5">to have it happen really the only way</font>

486
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,129
that you can get these sort of projects

487
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:50,500
done through this sort of grassroots

488
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,210

somebody at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mayor's office or at</font>

490
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,909
least the supervisors level to be able

491
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,799
to say this

492
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:58,659
my project<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm going to I'm going to</font>

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of follows suit of what</font>

495
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:06,159
whatever the wind is blowing at this

496
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:09,220
point and for about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a year or so after</font>

497
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,509
Chris and Mayor Newsom left we were kind

498
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:14,590
of running<font color="#E5E5E5"> around trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out</font>

499
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:16,090
how to get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> direction so the other</font>

500
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,799
problems we ran into<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the fact that</font>

501
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,619
most city governments are not designed

502
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:24,460
to sell resources and such in fact the

503
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:26,738
fiber installation and the copper assets

504
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,700
were specifically set so that they could

505
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:33,429
not be resold to customers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we</font>

506
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,349
just recently as in actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> about six</font>

507
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:36,489
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight months ago got some rules</font>

508
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:40,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">passed that we can actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font>

509
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:41,349
reselling at this point in fact Robert

shoe is one of the Board of Supervisors

511
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:47,950
has announced that we're officially

512
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:50,200
starting to do that to this there's

513
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,759
there's two sizes as I mentioned there's

514
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,039
the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the nonprofit side which is</font>

515
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">a side that's that's supporting the</font>

housing developments and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonprofits</font>

517
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,729
and such and we want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

518
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:01,960
sustainable the non the nonprofit the

519
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:03,309
non commercial side we're going to be

520
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,499
creating<font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact we're in the middle of</font>

incorporation at this point fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> steve</font>

522
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:11,559
is kind of giving us some pointers on

523
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">this because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of nanog to create a</font>

starting to go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the commercial side</font>

529
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:29,700
of things in fact right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

530
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:33,158
three commercial companies so to speak

531
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:35,529
we have UCSF which is one of that it's a

532
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,879
main hospital for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> city of San</font>

533
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:38,609
Francisco which has campuses all over

534
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:40,840
the place they're buying dark fiber

535
00:21:38,609 --> 00:21:44,168
America's Cup is going to be coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

536
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:46,599
in next year i think 2013 they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

537
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:47,830
to be taking up all the Embarcadero pier

538
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:49,989
space and we're going to be providing

539
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:52,210
fiber to that kind of a big peering

540
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:54,220
fabric or fabric between all the peers

541
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:58,090
as well as it goes all the way back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

542
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,649
200 Paul and then we're also as I

543
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,779
mentioned sutro tower there's we're

544
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:03,639
putting in fiber into there that's going

545
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:06,249
to be a big sort of media fabric where

546
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:07,649
we're going to be hooking up the nine TV

547
00:22:06,249 --> 00:22:08,850
stations in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the five FM</font>

548
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:11,100
stations that are up at that location

549
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:13,409
and then bringing that back to hopefully

550
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,449
cross connect to people actually produce

551
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:17,340
content so that they can push that back

552
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,140
as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to their studios</font>

553
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:22,709
for their for their studio transmitter

554
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,690
links the couple of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things I want to</font>

555
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,940
mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the fact that in the</font>

with one gigabit when you get it so one

587
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:36,900
sort of like real-time and real feel of

00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,910
flipping through a book that they've

589
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,720
digitized but it requires quite a bit of

590
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,580
bandwidth because there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>
