round of applause so in all seriousness

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:03,120
as you guys know we we had a transition

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,548
recently from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Merritt to a our own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 501 C</font>

20
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,549
have been possible and I think that

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're better off for it so we really</font>

22
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,229
appreciate them and we think this is

23
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,479
awesome another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the actual</font>

24
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,189
sponsors for this particular meeting I

25
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,289
had a little chat with the board members

26
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,689
on a mailing list right before this the

27
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,270
last time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we raised prices was literally</font>

28
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,820
exactly to this meeting five years ago

29
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I don't know a conference that you</font>

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,990
can go to that is this important has

31
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,960

many influential people that cost 450

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,970
bucks and hasn't raised their price in

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,579
five years so you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> should really</font>

35
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,170
thank them especially given that this is

36
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,579
practically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only time you see them</font>

37

39
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,159

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,899

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,160
but I said once a long time ago at a

54
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,540
community meeting that I if I could get

55

conference which isn't hard cash outlay

61
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,929
we just don't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the revenue for it I</font>

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't even blink about doing at and</font>

63
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,829
these guys don't blink<font color="#E5E5E5"> about doing their</font>

64
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:48,420
work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and some of them been doing</font>

65

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,679
hundred fifty dollar free entry so

67
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,660
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important that you</font>

68
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,209
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much time and effort that</font>

69
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,720
these people put in the membership

70
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:02,280
sponsors and attendees<font color="#E5E5E5"> know attendees no</font>

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,090
conference so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess we should</font>

73
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">swank these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all important and</font>

74
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,780
ridiculously important to us we could

75
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,010
not again have done the transition we

76
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,329
couldn't have put on this conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

77
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,170
couldn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done everything that you</font>

78
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:20,760
guys see in here without them when I

79
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,410
very first started the whole let's get

80
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,019
out for merit and do our own thing the

81
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,340
the founding principle was if you

82
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,870
weren't paying attention if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you had ear</font>

83
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,069
muffs on and didn't you know pay

84
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,389
attention at the gossip in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room and</font>

85
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:32,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just walked in and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started watching</font>

86
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:33,540
the presentations you should not see a

87
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,399
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that these</font>

88
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,380
vendors helped us ensure that happened

89
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,880
because I don't see a difference in fact

90
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,880
if anything I see it's better not worse

91
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:49,739
finally a special thank you to Tony

92
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,359
capella if you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to nanog</font>

93
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,390
for many years then you'll know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

94
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,540
Wi-Fi has been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> source of what's called</font>

95
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:00,208
hilarity ensues again and then we ask

96
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:02,370
this guy named Anton and he said hey I

97
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:05,810
know what r f stands for so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

98
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,860
fix it and it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been great ever since</font>

99
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,120
again I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know of a conference where</font>

100
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,120
I can go to with many hundreds of people

101
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,940
and the Wi-Fi is<font color="#CCCCCC"> as stable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this well</font>

102
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,168
performing unfortunately this is

103
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,668
anthony's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anton's external very last</font>

104
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:23,639
nanog where he's going to help us<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

105
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:25,169
the Wi-Fi so everyone thank Tony he set

106
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,510
us up we know what we're going to do in

107
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:29,490
the future I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll be fine but we</font>

108
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,070
owe him<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great debt because I like to</font>

109
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:43,050
get email while I watch presentations

110
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:44,610
thank you some statistics<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went over</font>

111
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,350
these before we actually keep much

112
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,360
better statistics about like who comes

113
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,860
who paid what who did these kind of

114
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,090
things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did in the past these are</font>

115
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,550
all publicly available we're a very

116
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,440
transparent organization the only

117
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,729
comment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can make on this is that</font>

118
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,500
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little disappointing to me that</font>

119
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,240
we only had two students so if you guys

120
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,430
know any students that are doing these

121
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,550
kind of things then we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> get them</font>

122
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,620
in here you all saw Jesse give a

123
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,510
presentation here from MIT you see how

124
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,910
important his work is and he's actually

125
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,260
useful to the community let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

126
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:17,400
of those guys in here so that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

127
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:19,500
more and then statistics top countries

128
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,840
shockingly the United<font color="#E5E5E5"> States is first I</font>

129
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,600
know you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> surprised shockingly</font>

130
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,940
again Canada a second it is a little

131
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">surprising to me that Japan had 13</font>

132
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,330
people here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess you know a lot</font>

133
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,280
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are NTT who's very strong</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">countries that had more than five people</font>

137
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,669
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font>

138
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,229
everybody is that you know there's ripe

139
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:42,810
apricot nanog and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i honestly believe</font>

140
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:44,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">that nanog has more people coming from</font>

141

sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Nexus this is good but we</font>

143
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,789
