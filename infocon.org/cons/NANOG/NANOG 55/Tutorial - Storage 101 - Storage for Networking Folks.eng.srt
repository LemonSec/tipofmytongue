9
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:20,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most part it doesn't work with fcoe</font>

10
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:21,760
it's the way they terminate<font color="#CCCCCC"> max and some</font>

11
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,320
other to some other challenges this is

12
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,090
all going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get fixed we're still very</font>

13
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,680
early in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the game anyone that tells you</font>

14
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,969
that technology dominates<font color="#CCCCCC"> in two years</font>

15
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,530
in sales these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 year programs but</font>

16
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:36,130
the challenge is is that if you

17
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:39,599
implement multi-hop without congestion

18
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:46,030
notification so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no method for</font>

19
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:48,310
him to tell him to slow down all he can

20
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,830
do is tell him<font color="#E5E5E5"> to slow down and all he</font>

21
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,340
can do it tell him<font color="#CCCCCC"> the foot down the end</font>

22
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:56,640
up with an interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation because</font>

23
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:59,830
well what happen is is that if

24
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:03,590
essentially you look at that line when

25
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:06,349
you actually have is a hurry

26
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:09,460
well there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to multiplex there's</font>

27
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:12,320
no way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spread so if you declare that</font>

28
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:15,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know the third channel is for fcoe</font>

29
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:19,060
that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> F Tsui goes you can't go</font>

30
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:23,290
anywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> else just on that one time and</font>

31
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:28,280
so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get congestion on</font>

32
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:32,720
that port there which is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

33
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:36,140
one two and three so one two and three

34
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:41,630
so basically a pause frame is sent on

35
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:46,039
that channel then this switch basically

36
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:48,740
has to send a pause frame to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

37
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:52,490
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> three devices which are on these</font>

38
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:56,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">three paths there's only one path for</font>

39
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:59,320
fcoe and so when that pause frame is

40
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,030
sent and actually a stream of<font color="#E5E5E5"> POD frame</font>

41
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,420
what you actually end up doing is

42
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:10,669
stopping all traffic for all of these

43
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:12,890
hosts so by just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to pause for a</font>

44
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:18,230
second traffic on three hosts to end up

45
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:21,550
taking out nine now this is only going

46
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:24,530
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen in very high load situation</font>

47
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,080
the reason why I know this is because we

48
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">went through this with fibre channel</font>

49
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,469
nine years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something right in</font>

50
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,210
fibre channel we have something called

51
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,100
virtual channels so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

52
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:37,700
separate this<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic out and do</font>

53
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:41,270
individual flow control but basically

54
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:45,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">until congestion notification is working</font>

55
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:50,180
properly with fcoe there's no way for me

56
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,580
to tell just him to slow down I have to

57
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:57,109
tell him and<font color="#E5E5E5"> his two friends to slow</font>

58
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:59,660
down and so essentially the result is is

59
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,060
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a you know in a QA environment</font>

60
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,170
or a test environment something that's

61
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,489
you know or even a production

62
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:08,060
environment is just not doing a lot of

63
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:10,250
traffic it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be fine one hop no</font>

64
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,869
problem caches are doing it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a</font>

65
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of people are doing it top Iraq so</font>

66
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,420
you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> fcoe to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the top Iraq and then you</font>

67
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,800
break out to native fibre channel

68
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">work great and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop FC</font>

69
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,449
works a lot of companies support it but

70
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:27,180
under a high load situation this is what

71
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:30,690
you wish and this is why a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

72
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:33,239
are delaying deployment I mean there's

73
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,820
other challenges depending on how touch

74
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,710
you the customer is<font color="#E5E5E5"> air gap separation</font>

75
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,510
and so forth you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to deal with but</font>

76
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:42,690
essentially when you start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

77
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:45,230
test lab so forth that's one of the main

78
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:48,330
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really kind of hurting</font>

79
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,920
adoption however once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

80
00:09:48,330 --> 00:10:01,140
caution that all of these new

81
00:09:49,920 --> 00:10:04,589
technologies krill SPD fcoe<font color="#CCCCCC"> dcd now Sdn</font>

82
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,780
open flow and then like you know look at

83
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:09,660
look and look in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at look</font>

87

secret I'd be in meetings and someone

88
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:24,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">would ask the manager are you running</font>

93
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,150
installing and production it wasn't that

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">many years ago if you recommended</font>

95

someone to run virtualization and

96
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:40,710
production they would laugh at you now

97
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,720
you have to justify why you wouldn't so

98
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good technologies like</font>

103
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,560
to be looking at the success of

104
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:01,260
something like fcoe today and using that

105
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,910
to judge whether it's going to do well

106
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,250
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> five years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a little a</font>

110
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:16,069
potential and that they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be given</font>

111
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:18,030
the opportunity to reach that potential

112
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,330
moving forward you do have some

113
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,329
interesting

114
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:29,110
points of of change and essentially

115
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,800
while it's nice now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone's</font>

116
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:34,750
doing 6664 you are going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> run into</font>

117
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,540
some interesting scenarios depending on

118
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:41,070
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the adoption rate is a 40 gig</font>

119
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:45,160
Ethernet because essentially while

120
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:46,930
things like ficon and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a net and fibre</font>

121
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:51,010
channel will continue to develop for

122
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:53,229
years and years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and years if for nothing</font>

123
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:56,350
else there are a lot of customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

124
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:58,450
don't take no<font color="#CCCCCC"> for an answer you do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

125
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,900
in some interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenarios say in</font>

126
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:05,200
like 20 you know twenty sixteen or

127
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:07,030
twenty fourteen where if something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

128
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,920
40 gig Ethernet has already been

129
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,870
shipping for all I mean I've already

130
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:15,310
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> them I'm sure you guys have it well</font>

131
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:16,660
dual port 40 gig Ethernet cards I saw an

132
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,140
interesting presentation from a large

133
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,510
TPU manufacturer that claimed that by

134
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:29,140
2015 motherboards would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> do 100 gb</font>

135
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:31,540
ethernet but you know you do start

136
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:34,480
running some interesting areas where

137
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:37,209
essentially the desire perhaps not to do

138
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,760
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> over one cable but to do</font>

139
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:44,680
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the same cable become</font>

140
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:48,339
very cost driven right in the you know

141
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:51,219
if you can get a large number of you

142
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:53,830
know hunger gig interfaces for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly</font>

143
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,470
cheap price that does to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>
