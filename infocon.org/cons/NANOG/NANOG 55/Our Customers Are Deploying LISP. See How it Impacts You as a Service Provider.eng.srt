1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,710
uh Randy or someone else if you can just

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,150
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he gets if he has slides</font>

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,798
for his<font color="#CCCCCC"> lighting talk gets them into the</font>

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:16,619
back the folks in the back if you uh if

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:18,539
you see him<font color="#E5E5E5"> before so yeah just a couple</font>

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,448
of announcements first of all I'd like

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,250
to thank our sponsor<font color="#E5E5E5"> Telus for the</font>

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,070
social last night that was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun</font>

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,720
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the telus world of science so I</font>

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:34,290
had a good time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope everyone else did</font>

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:36,660
thank you very much thanks also to our

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,040
sponsors for the breakfast and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:44,010
the socials that we got to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this</font>

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:48,510
was a another great if rather tiring

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,489
nanog with all the socials to go to but

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think we all had a lot of fun so I</font>

17
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,820
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the one more round of applause</font>

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:01,530
for all the socials and for our sponsors

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:04,799
thank you just a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcements</font>

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,330
before we get started I know this kind

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,960
of goes without saying but let's try to

22
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:12,210
remember to silence our devices

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,100
computers cell phones smartphones all

24
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,809
those devices that make noise please try

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">to silence them it's very distracting up</font>

26
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,920
here for the speakers so please if you

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:26,670
could do that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be really nice</font>

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:32,579
for all of us and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's about</font>

29
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:34,790
it in the way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> announcements so I'm</font>

30
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:42,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to bring up our next speaker and</font>

31
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:44,970
that is that's Paul<font color="#E5E5E5"> vintage era and he's</font>

32
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,320
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a talk on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisp this sort of</font>

33
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">follow-on to where we left off yesterday</font>

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,850
it's called our customers are deploying

35
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lisp see how it impacts you as a service</font>

36
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,439
provider so go ahead Paul

37
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,580
Oh Vinciguerra<font color="#CCCCCC"> vincy consulting and I</font>

38
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,649
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to you saying about what</font>

39
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:23,590
our customers are doing they're

40
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:27,790
deploying<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lisp after speaking to a bunch</font>

41
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,840
of people here I think the mindset is

42
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,280
that Lisp is still something that's

43
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,350
experimental and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's</font>

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:40,360
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really ready but i can tell you</font>

45
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:42,310
customers are using it today and you

46
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,630
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how it how it works and how</font>

47
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">it impacts your networks</font>

48
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,090
for the most

49
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:41,150
sorry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that folks we're just having</font>

50
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:42,710
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of issue with the slides</font>

51
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,770
right now we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fixed right</font>

52
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,770
away

53
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,420
yep

54
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,120
yes

55
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,310
it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> vest</font>

56
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,340
ok ok go ahead Paul<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I</font>

57
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> customers are</font>

58
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,570
deploying list today but really it's

59
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">your customers are deploying it because</font>

60
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:00,520
what lists what happens with Lisp is we

61
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:07,600
wind up using<font color="#CCCCCC"> your service provider</font>

62
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:10,570
networks as transport so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

63
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,800
why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we even get involved</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in deploying</font>

64
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:18,040
deploy this and as you know everyone's

65
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,400
customers are moving to the cloud I hate

66
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:24,490
the cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> the term the cloud it doesn't</font>

67
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:30,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">really mean anything they want high</font>

68
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:33,070
availability they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for extra</font>

69
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,359
ways to increase their bandwidth to get

70
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,820
them to the cloud and they're looking

71
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:43,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">for ways to not lose individual links</font>

72
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:44,800
anymore they're expecting availability

73
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:49,750
benefits beyond what they can get today

74
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:52,270
with vgp that's why we're starting to

75
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:54,640
see more and more interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in people</font>

76
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:58,740
deploying<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lisp typically what happens</font>

77
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:02,909
today is people our customers take on

78
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:05,080
the deployment on their own typically

79
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,610
they have their<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise edge and they</font>

80
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,700
have the data center someplace else and

81
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:13,300
they're running bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming across</font>

82
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,310
them no<font color="#CCCCCC"> less Pattullo so first thing</font>

83
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,970
they do is they go out and they'll do

84
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:21,400
upgrades to install the<font color="#CCCCCC"> x TRS and delia</font>

85
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,870
map servers and map resolvers so that

86
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:29,590
they can start<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting the fundamental</font>

87
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:32,409
benefits of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists at this point they</font>

88
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:36,579
have traffic engineering capabilities

89
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:40,390
that they can do very simple load

90
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:42,010
balancing across the links they can

91
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:45,640
start using their excess capacity as

92
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:50,939
opposed to typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> with bgp there in</font>

93
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:54,220
an active passive role

94
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:55,629
once the once<font color="#CCCCCC"> their you've gotten to</font>

95
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,329
that point they typically want to start

96
00:08:55,629 --> 00:09:00,279
adding in a dress mobility Lisp allows

97
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:03,849
for individual addresses to be moved

98
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:06,939
anywhere so by adding in the PX TR

99
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:10,240
functions addresses can turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> around and</font>

100
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:18,368
be moved from one location to another

101
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:22,110
location so it's much simpler for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

102
00:09:18,369 --> 00:09:25,389
this infrastructure to be put external

being deployed in a service provider

104
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:31,689
area as opposed to the enterprise doing

105
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:35,469
it themselves when the enterprise then

106
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:41,199
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do list all that they do is</font>

data center and their remote offices and

111
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,910
remote locations there are opportunities

112
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:07,319
for running a lisp for multiple circuits

113
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:11,199
for doing high availability and

114

additional redundancy on the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

providing hosted data center services

118
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,600
there's an opportunity for providing

119
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:29,610
higher availability and simpler

120
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,709
deployment and the service provider cell

can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in the either in the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">TRS okay is there a lisp on your network</font>

124
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:48,629
today I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer to that you're</font>

125
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:52,859
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see is yes it's typically</font>

126
00:10:48,629 --> 00:10:58,179
tunneled in UDP it runs over yup what's

127
00:10:52,860 --> 00:11:02,439
43 42 and 43 41 control and data planes

128
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:03,939
and if we go to one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our routers we'll</font>

129
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:07,329
see

130
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:11,529
yes you'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> lisp on your networks</font>

131
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:11,529
the thing that's interesting here is

132
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:16,400
listen tunneling is done in UDP it's not

133
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">done in GRE which is what I think</font>

134
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:23,050
everybody's used to create a GRE tunnel

135
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:26,080
between two points and the tunnels up

136
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:29,870
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems with GRE is</font>

137
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:32,680
everything's flowing over 11 path when

138
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:38,510
it's UDP you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> options of</font>

139
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:45,319
distributing the data / flow so if we

140
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:47,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the list data plane before</font>

141
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,640
we initially<font color="#E5E5E5"> deployed list our traffic</font>

142

143
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,740

00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:58,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">buggy and after we deploy that we went</font>

00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:05,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to eight to one the day we deployed it</font>

146
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:07,279
in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our incoming traffic so the</font>

147
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">question was why didn't we get one to</font>

148
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:13,760
one we were configured to be one to one

149
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:16,280
and it wasn't what we were seeing so

150
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,600
digging down further turned into we had

151
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,220
heavy ipsec traffic flows that it was

152
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,950
turning into we had one this one source

153
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:27,530
in one destination it was one flow

154
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:32,030
everything took that one path the thing

155
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:37,339
that turned out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be interesting if we</font>

156
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:44,180
come we look at it this is all protocol

157
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:47,030
32 protocol 50 ipsec the siskel

158
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:50,030
implementation goes and maps the the SP

159
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:54,290
is as source and destination ports so

160
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:59,030
that we get load balancing power<font color="#CCCCCC"> spi in</font>

161
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:01,910
a VPN if you wanted to do better traffic

162
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:04,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">engineering you could break up how you</font>

163
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:08,980
define your interesting traffic if you

164
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:12,050
really had a need for balancing so

165
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:14,780
coming back to production list volume

166
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,620
and some of the earlier feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

167
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:20,890
getting from people is

168
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:23,890
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that's not it's not</font>

169
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:27,360
really out there it's not prevalent the

170
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:36,030
list beta network that's out there ah

171
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:39,270
what we do there p<font color="#E5E5E5"> xtr which is the</font>

172

174
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:51,969
the term they use beta it's been beta

175
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:54,040
for four years five years now I think

176
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's time that they need to up it to</font>

177
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,990
that's where they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing their</font>

178
00:13:55,150 --> 00:14:04,150
innovation in that this network<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

179
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:05,470
always up when someone says beta to me

180
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,819
it's it's something that's there when

181
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,370
they're they're making changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

bring everything down I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

183
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:21,370
use this network all the time and this

00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:45,940
time there's a good amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisp</font>

191
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:47,350
traffic out there so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where I</font>

00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">think things start getting interesting</font>

193
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,430
for everyone here is what does this all

194
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,829
mean to you we were talking yesterday

195
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:56,949
about different components<font color="#CCCCCC"> PX TRS and x</font>

TRS<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all these other terms but at</font>

197
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,790
some point they need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought down</font>

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:05,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">to how it's going to impact how you run</font>

199
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:08,349
your networks so you're single provider

200
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">who's providing transit for customer</font>

201
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,560
you're supporting their headquarters in

204

back and forth the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same as it does if</font>

205
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,230
they weren't running list except for the

206
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:29,530
fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> their their addresses are not</font>

207
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,339
your addresses their addresses that have

208
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:36,100
been allocated

209
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:40,029
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a IDs so if you're also providing</font>

210
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:47,220
transit for another customer who's not

211
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:47,220
running a lisp what happens when when

212
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:56,889
when your customer here wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to wants</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak to this customer they have no</font>

reference for<font color="#CCCCCC"> what their eid addresses</font>

215
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:06,129
are so what happens is they wind up

216
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:08,529
going to appt extr which is located

217
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:12,639
someplace and most likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not on</font>

218
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:15,399
your network so their traffic flows flow

219
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,800
to the PX TR that doesn capsulation and

220
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:21,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">impact it into insights and this is what</font>

221
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:25,389
happens whenever you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> from from</font>

00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:27,579
a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> face two anonymous space so you</font>

may think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because your custom your</font>

224
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:31,269
three customers are all on your your

225
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:33,749

226
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:37,889
they may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily be</font>

227
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:37,889
communicating it means that you think

228
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:49,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so if we look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a specific traffic</font>

229
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:54,240
flow for someone who's in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> eid space</font>

230
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:56,529
somebody who's using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lisp addresses</font>

231
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,899
they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> in there they're pulling</font>

232
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:02,290
down a tree looks like a five make

233
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:06,609
stream here what<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually happens is</font>

234
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:09,668
they wind up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sending data if you can</font>

235
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:12,039
goes to the PX feel it actually goes

236
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:18,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">through the PX PR gets encapsulated and</font>

237
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:18,089
then gets passed down to the destination

238
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:28,830
and it kind of flows like this

239
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:31,800
so when the PX TRS are located<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside</font>

240
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:39,360
of your backbone you wind up having to

241
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:40,980
having the trains down transit back so

242
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,550
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cases for the way</font>

no transition and in the in the same

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:25,169
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> far the most complex path because the</font>

273
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,500
islands p ITR travels to that and then

274
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,570
he tunnels it back to his customer so

275
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,350
even when the two devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> are sitting</font>

through a three-step process by

00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:25,590
the DDT is the glue that starts bringing

291
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:32,909
all these environments together to lower

292
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:35,370
the impact of lisp on your networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

293
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:37,320
so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have for DDT</font>

294
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,489
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think this was demonstrated in the</font>

295
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,770
slides yesterday where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw the</font>

296
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,900
ratcheting effect well they went up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

297
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:46,168
the root<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coming down to</font>

298
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:49,850
find where the locations were if we go

299
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:53,280
in this is a query that we did against

300
00:20:49,850 --> 00:21:00,689
our DDT route to look in our address

301
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:04,710
space and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can see is our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

302
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:10,470
space that we were looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the 199</font>

303
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:14,549
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1975 dot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero is available through</font>

304
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:17,280
an ipv4 and ipv6 address and then it

305
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:22,260
brings us directly down to the to the

306
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:26,100
map server that can handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if we go</font>

307
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:28,320
and we use our same DDT route to look

308
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,149
for addresses that are in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beta</font>

309
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,549
network you will see that they go

310
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:36,600
through a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hops first they go</font>

311
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:38,220
through and they look at 153 1600 they

312
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:43,289
come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> they find a more specific route</font>

313
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:45,570
for a / 19 and then they finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped</font>

314
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:47,100
it at the / 24 and they give us the

315
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,290
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and find that and that</font>

316
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,090
was what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you saw yesterday in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides</font>

317
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,620
were they where they went and they

318
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> walk the tree until they</font>

319
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,909
found their their source and then they

320
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:07,080
would just ferment on cash at at that

321
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:09,240
final destination<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so when we were</font>

322
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">deploying this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we we had a couple of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">concerns and a couple of operational</font>

324
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:17,040
issues that we came across the first one

325
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:19,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">was empty use because we're doing</font>

326
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,389
encapsulation we were concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

327
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:27,900
what is that going to do for people who

328
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:32,510
are stuck at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1500 MTU size people who</font>

329
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,510
are PPO a or encapsulated in other

330
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,340
tunneling protocols what we found out

331
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was interesting is that with the</font>

00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:43,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">cisco implementation it actually does a</font>

00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:45,389
PMT you check and does the adjustments

334
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:48,450
it will go figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what's the right</font>

335
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:53,280
size for the packets and an adjustable

336
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:55,770
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way so we were concerned that we</font>

were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pxe are coming back was</font>

339
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:06,000
not seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> latency was a problem and</font>

340
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,520
the actual biggest problem that we came

341
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,010
across was the fact that the way list

342
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,200
works is we do basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> rounded by our</font>

343
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:15,330
lock which we do rounding by your

344
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,020
router's upstream address the address

345
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:21,270
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you normally give us on the / 32</font>

346
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:25,550
now what's happening in the New<font color="#E5E5E5"> York</font>

347
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:29,400
area service<font color="#E5E5E5"> providers are doing</font>

348
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:31,710
carrier-grade NAT the up the uplink

349
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,420
address is a private address because

350
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,720
it's a private address we can't actually

351
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,100
route to it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been a case</font>

352

where we haven't been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to deploy</font>
