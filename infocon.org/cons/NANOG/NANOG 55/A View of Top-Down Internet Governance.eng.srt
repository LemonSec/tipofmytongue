2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:13,320
is going to talk about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> top-down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> view</font>

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,330
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet car governance I'm sorry I'm</font>

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,300
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> jetlagged so I'm my words are not</font>

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,310
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming well out of my mouth but I</font>

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:33,740
see Jesse he is here and that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:33,739
way better so good<font color="#E5E5E5"> afternoon</font>

8
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,180
maybe you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> see my song nobody</font>

9
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">wants to hear me sing a song are you</font>

10
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure I'm positive</font>

11
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:25,939
oh here we go awesome so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be</font>

12
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:31,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">giving a presentation on top down</font>

13
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:33,619
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> governance so my primary</font>

14
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,749
research focuses on understanding how

15
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:37,729
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom-up communities</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually work</font>

16
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:41,630
but today I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about</font>

17
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:44,719
top down so rather than<font color="#CCCCCC"> a i'm certainly</font>

18
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:47,750
not peddling the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I to present a itu</font>

19
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:50,178
position<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm more of a more looking at</font>

20
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,229
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of a public service</font>

21
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:53,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">announcement from your friendly</font>

22
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:58,099
neighbourhood policy wonk so what are

23
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the what are the key takeaways here the</font>

24
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:00,979
first is that the International

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,409
Telecommunications regulations are being

26
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:05,569
renegotiated as we speak they're going

27
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:08,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">they will be formally renegotiated in</font>

28
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:09,699
December the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITRs regulate traditional</font>

29
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:13,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">inner connection costs read</font>

30
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:14,839
telecommunications basically how the how

31
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:16,578
various telecom operators decide who

32
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,340
gets paid for<font color="#E5E5E5"> originating and</font>

33
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:21,769
termination under the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITRs the</font>

34
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet is exempt these were these were</font>

35
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:28,549
set up in 1988 back when the internet

36
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:30,079
was a just a toy research project but

37
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,790
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is cutting</font>

38
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:34,670
into international telecom revenue

39
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:37,459
streams and that uh and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> draws the</font>

40
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,599
attention of state regulators so the key

41
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:41,480
proposals that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think are interesting</font>

42
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:44,179
to you are that route in origin and

43
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,399
identification are key proposals in the

44
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the recent I in the renegotiation of</font>

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,489
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITRs as well as regulation appearing</font>

46
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:54,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">reigate appearing arrangements so think</font>

47
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:57,590
of our seven France and other efforts at

48
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:58,910
saying hey we'd like to know how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

49
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,870
interconnected and why are

50
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,690
interconnecting and understand your

51
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,380
contractual relations so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

52
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:08,269
that I am posing to the community as a

53
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:11,359
bottom-up guy talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> top-down is</font>

54
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:13,160
how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you convey the positive economic</font>

55
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:16,400
outcomes of the existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

56
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,440
industry to regulators the mechanisms

57
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,239
that you use the ways the tube here are

58
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,950
the ways that you resolve problems how

59
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,019
can you convey those positive outcomes

60
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,700
to regulators to convey to them that

61
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:28,789
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that the Internet is a nice</font>

62
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,320
stable happy place and so the second

63
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:32,690
part of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how do you engage with</font>

64
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,790
top down governance organizations and so

65
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,409
to get to

66
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,090
idea to get to how do you engage with

67
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:40,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">top-down government relations we are</font>

68
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,280
going to talk about governance and when

69
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">I first gave this presentation I</font>

70
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,840
mentioned it to someone and when I said

71
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:51,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">governance their response was to hiss at</font>

72
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:54,189
me literally I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk we are</font>

73
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,899
going to talk about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> G word and I'm</font>

74
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:59,950
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to convince you that it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> evil</font>

75
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,599
it does not equal government and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

76
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,920
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you are engaging in some of these</font>

77
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,578
behaviors already you're already

78
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:09,369
creating order so being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good little</font>

79
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:11,109
academic I would not be true to my

80
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,760
nature if I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some bookish</font>

81
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:16,120
definitions and some fun little academic

82
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,889
definitions while those definitions are

83
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,000
pretty they're not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the focus the</font>

84
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:25,360
objective is to help frame the problem

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,130
and the problem is pretty simple to

86
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,460
frame regulators are in the business of

87
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,860
saying what you should be doing

88
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,349
operators you are in the business of

89
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,560
getting things done in the business of

90
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:41,320
how things work so the discussion point

91
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,820
is how to facilitate communication

92
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,729
between the operator communities and

93
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:48,099
regulators so let's press into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font>

94
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:50,380
definitions so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Internet</font>

95
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:51,699
Governance definition provided by on the

96
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group on internet governance</font>

97
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:55,330
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that was put</font>

98
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:56,440
together by the UN and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

99
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,659
walk through some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this and kind of</font>

100
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,719
point out why it's a what instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how</font>

101
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:04,719
definition so no dimension of respective

102
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,539
roles as a product of a government<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

103
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,620
primarily government-driven body

104
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:12,010
governments retain their privilege rule

105
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,740
note that capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> G is not a typo so</font>

106
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,389
what this doesn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you is how</font>

107
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of these objectives are going to do</font>

108
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,449
how is this development going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

109
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,000
who's going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> development lots of</font>

110
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:24,039
contention here over how another is is

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,690
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of shared principles norms</font>

112
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:27,760
rules decision-making procedures and

113
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,610
programs this is all well and good this

114
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">all sounds nice but what is not pointed</font>

115
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,500
out is that if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go back through</font>

116
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,729
history building<font color="#CCCCCC"> a regime of this nature</font>

117
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,120
building regime to fulfill these

118
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:42,219
requirements is hard it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not easy</font>

119
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,610
history tells us<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you need a strong</font>

120
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:47,110
hegemonic leader to enforce these norms

121
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,680
rules is making<font color="#CCCCCC"> to engage in the</font>

122
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,000
monitoring

123
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,880
forcement that really makes the regime

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,740
work and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just look at this</font>

125
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,659
definition and some of the discussion

126
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:00,430
around it it's a kind of if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> build it</font>

127
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:02,380
they will come the final aspect is

128
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:06,430
shaping the evolution which i think is a

129
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:08,320
extraordinarily ambitious goal the idea

130
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,900
that through the authority of a state

131
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,330
one can shape the evolution of the

132
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,489
Internet this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't really get the</font>

133
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,650
idea of how or what mechanisms are

134
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,160
effective this gets to this is derived

135
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,810
from Authority not as I would argue

136
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,580
discussing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom-up organizations</font>

137
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,410
the experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one gets from</font>

138
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,740
empirically doing this from actually

139
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:33,759
building these systems so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

140
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,979
make a I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to propose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you that</font>

141
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,630
this so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what and but we're not</font>

142
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,849
really talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how and I'm going</font>

143
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,960
to propose to you that some other

144
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:44,469
academic definitions actually have some

145
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,239
pragmatic use here so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

146
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,800
look at governance is that governance<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

147
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,060
the means by which community affects its

148
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,610
image of order and hoops and you are

149
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,490
that community so I would argue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

this community the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet go the</font>

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,430
has identified pragmatic mechanisms that

155
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:12,159
are explicitly or implicitly adopted and

156
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,949
the the point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you create an</font>

157
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:17,770
image of order it may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be as easily</font>

158
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:19,419
understood to government regulators as

they would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> but within this</font>

160
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:24,099
community through what I've seen you

161
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,859
seem to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a good handle on what you</font>

162
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:28,780
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the norms and objectives are so</font>

163
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,840
that image of order is what has the

164
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,250
community find defined as its goals what

165
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,650
why does<font color="#E5E5E5"> what does the community value</font>

166
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,449
how given that context why are these

167
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,940
effective all of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are part of the</font>

168
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:42,280
bottom-up process of this means by which

169
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,080
community affects its image of order and

170
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,250
this should really read images of order

171
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,599
there are a number of different

172
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,250
communities and they all<font color="#CCCCCC"> have different</font>

00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">images border but I'd argue that they</font>

174
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,180
all follow bottom-up consensus building

175
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:54,639
process which is very different<font color="#E5E5E5"> and very</font>

176
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:59,070
foreign to to some of the government

177
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,150
regulators in the ITU so unpacking means

178
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:03,370
the idea

179
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:05,080
is that you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid</font>

180
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,750
potential conflicts that threaten to and

181
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:12,669
do the opportunities<font color="#CCCCCC"> to realize mutual</font>

182
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:15,850
gains so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to describe</font>

183
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:17,920
very abstractly what the what I believe

184
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,880
the operator communities do it is

185
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,140
informal but they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known norms</font>

186
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,850
moreover there is a very as will get

00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,880
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this more there's a very distinct</font>

188
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,830
difference between the telecom metaphor

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,900
metaphors the ideas of circuit based

190
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,610
accounting rate systems and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how those</font>

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> regulated from how the internet</font>

192
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,350
actually works now there's also a when

193
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,819
we think about riddim limited potential

194
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,430
conflict there's a lot of discussion

195
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:47,710
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will be getting into about how</font>

196
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:49,120
to how disputes are resolved so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

197
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,130
we've given a little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference</font>

198
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">between what and how we're going to dive</font>

199
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:56,560
into a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of who precisely it is</font>

200
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,969
that is a that is vying for this

201
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,569
governance role or vying for these

202
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:05,980
governance rules so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

are the bottom of organizations that

<font color="#E5E5E5">many of us are familiar with many of us</font>

207
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,320
participate in every day and and we

208
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,050
understand how he's operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

contrast the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITU constellation comprises</font>

210
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,329
the UN and member states the IT use

211
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,510
power rather than being derived directly

212
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,460
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community as it is here power</font>

213
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,130
and legitimacy is delegated by the state

214
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,020
very much top down this is the basis of

215
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:37,300
authority<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this group is the idea that</font>

216
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:41,189
states have legitimate monopoly on power

217
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:44,380
and legitimate monopoly to regulate so

218
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is why do the folks in the</font>

UN in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the eye to feel internet</font>

220
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,090
regulation is necessary why do they

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:54,040
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they should have their fingers in</font>

222
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:55,750
this particular pot the basis of a

<font color="#E5E5E5">number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the arguments they make go</font>

224
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,620
back to the Millennium Development Goals

225
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">and as we go through this very brief</font>

226
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:04,870
history of where the ITU arguments come

227
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,300
from we'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is a number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

228
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,370
terminology issues mainly dealing with

229
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,800
policy jargon so for instance where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

230
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,420
see capacity building this often

231
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">translates to what this community would</font>

232
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,110
call training

233
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:18,220
outreach so all of these are standard

234
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,680
things you would you would expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

235
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,290
the UN peace security development human

236
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">rights etc etc but notice that these</font>

237
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,769
goals work they were established in two

238
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:28,930
thousand and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these folks are</font>

239
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:31,740
like hey there's this internet thing out

240
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:34,388
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it has like the potential to</font>

241
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,449
revolutionize how we how our world

242
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:39,910
operates how things how things move

243
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:41,649
along so a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these if you unpack</font>

244
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,550
them I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> just highlighted a few and I</font>

245
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:44,949
will stress that these are my

246
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,529
interpretations is that you see

247
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:49,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">development and poverty eradication you</font>

248
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:50,769
see information community information

249
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:52,389
and communication technologies

250

00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:55,480
economic development better quality of

252
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:57,430
life etc we don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

253
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,639
of these but the key point here is that

254
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:02,680
you notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these are the key issues</font>

255
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,470
these are what stays care about economic

256
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,870
development<font color="#CCCCCC"> and of course the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last point</font>

257
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,769
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> WSIS principles the world's</font>

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:24,490
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do so refining these we see that we</font>

get these<font color="#CCCCCC"> iw after taking those</font>

264

<font color="#CCCCCC">WSIS principles these are</font>

technology foundation capacity building

268
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:38,410
etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will argue that or I am arguing</font>

269
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:41,019
that the bonneville community is already

270
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:42,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing a lot of this it may not be as</font>

271
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:45,339
evident to governments because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

272
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,628
don't necessarily directly architect it

273
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:48,389
they do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly develop it but</font>

274
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:50,319
there's a lot of us already going on

275
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:54,430
capacity building training and outreach

276
00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:57,878
the rirs do this I XPS do this the this

277
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:59,500
community nanog does this local content

278
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:00,910
I mean that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the fun where</font>

279
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,300
the fundamental definitions of an IXP

280
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:06,579
media we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDNs we have a lot of</font>

281
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:12,160
effort on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and international</font>

282
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:14,439
regional cooperation so after a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

283
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,779
negotiation these principles result in

the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in Internet Governance</font>

285
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:22,209
forum the IGF so again the IGF as man as

286
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,099
mandated is supposed to be a place<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:26,140
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh for policy folks to get</font>

288
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,150
together it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea is that it's</font>

289
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,970
that it follows the<font color="#CCCCCC"> WSIS principles it's</font>

290
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,990
lightweight decentralized structure

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,150
transparent<font color="#CCCCCC"> democratic multilateral all</font>

292
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:36,760
those all those nice things so it's very

293
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:38,470
so the idea is it's a very welcoming

294
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,450

00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,709
that the IGF as constructed by

a great place for for policy folks from

something with a little more teeth

321
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,660
something that gives the power to

322
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,770
regulate back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> states but if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

follow this argument that I've been

326
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,960
the big deal why are we so worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,109
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the ITU it's a fairly old</font>

the International Telegraph<font color="#CCCCCC"> Union if</font>

334
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,310
that says anything to you it was the

primary standards and coordination body

336
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,780
until about the early nineties when this

337
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:13,750
this pesky thing really took off that

338
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,610
that internet took off so um so what are

339
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">the key issues the the organization is</font>

340
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,350
really broken up into the itu-r radio

the structural differences the process

354
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:54,740
engagement member states are the

ultimate decision makers<font color="#CCCCCC"> States appoint</font>

356

are um you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are beholden to stay within</font>

368
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,600
developing this presentation I went

369
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,460
found a few folks that i knew that

370
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,950
actually had participated in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITU and</font>

371
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:30,890
those folks were very quick to tell me a

372
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:33,310
very key difference if you don't poke

373
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:36,170
toe the party line for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your delegation</font>

374
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:39,020
you may likely be sent home and when I

375
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">say sent home they your representative</font>

376
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,770
takes your passport and literally sends

377
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:45,800
you home there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting</font>

378
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:49,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">story told to me about a fellow who</font>

379
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,469
decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he wanted to crazy idea to</font>

380
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,930
coordinate across the delegate parties

<font color="#E5E5E5">for different states this was a this was</font>

382
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,859
a delegate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in contrast to like just</font>

383
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,570
sticking with<font color="#E5E5E5"> his with his member state</font>

384
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,580
with his group he was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually</font>

385
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:04,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">cooperate with the others to try to come</font>

386
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,920
up with a common idea his member

387

delegate took his passport sent him<font color="#E5E5E5"> home</font>

388
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,240
he was not toeing the party line that is

389
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:14,260
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very different structure than we</font>

390
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:17,990
see here so the ITU ultimately

391
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:20,569
facilitates telecom treaties such as the

392
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:25,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">ITRs that's how they've presented</font>

393
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:26,540
themselves thus far but at the moment

394
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,199
the ITU itself to not have regulatory

395
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:33,199
power but that may change and not sell

396
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,820
what they do now is they they deal with

397
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,980
international telecommunications over

398
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,050
any communication media except for as in

out of jail free card<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the Internet</font>

402
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:49,280
at the moment historically this includes

403
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,250
standards and cost structures so instead

404
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,350
of negotiating cost structures among

405
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,850
industry actors namely the companies

406

408
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,210
have the two states get together and say

<font color="#CCCCCC">we are going to negotiate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how much it</font>

444
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,659
organizations one particular example is

445
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,150
from some of the discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

446
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,040
early discussion of the WG IG and this

447
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:32,440
is the perception of the top down folks

448
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,600
they see that folks that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font>

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">does operate bottom up there is a very</font>

450
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:40,449
wide range of forums as we saw in the

451
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,100
and in the previous slides they but what

452
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,930
is perceived as<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're coordinating</font>

453
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,570
their activities through private forums

454
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,220
and there's a lot of loaded background

455
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,590
and when they say private forums when

456
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,540
they say private forums they mean not in

457
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the public eye not available</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

458
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:57,820

459
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,340
different than what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community would</font>

460
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:03,370
say about how open the community is and

00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,409
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> available and how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much the community</font>

471
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,630
a very distinct view of how bottom-up

stick with these abstract kind of

other things modes of traffic are

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,789
subject to termination rates so

00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:33,899
basically instead of you negotiating

there fun stuff I tears on transit

533
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:50,879
transit rate a rate set by a point by

534
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:53,639
the point of transit in a third country

535
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:55,228
in direct relation I actually couldn't

536
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:58,079
figure out what this would possibly mean

537
00:21:55,229 --> 00:22:00,779
this is a this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> unclear but it's</font>

538
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,948
clearly an effort to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm if you're</font>

539
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,229
transiting through our country we're

540
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:06,269
going to try to a get a little I would

541
00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:09,449
interpret this as try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a piece of</font>

542
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:11,189
the action this is typical of the

processing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we say all earlier where</font>

546
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:20,359
we include processing of data we see

547
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:25,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this would include an HTTP session</font>

548
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:25,668
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is essentially pay-per-click</font>

549
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:32,908
dispute resolution this is a this

550
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,739
language is um this language<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very WTO</font>

551
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:36,899
like this is straight out of your gear

640
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,260
lot of people's minds<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how is this not</font>

641
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,669
just pandering to a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people who</font>

642
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,700
shouldn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the authority they have</font>

643
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:08,770
like why are we why should we play their

644
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,270
game why can't we just repeatedly

645
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,860
demonstrate that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the wrong</font>

646
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,720
thing and they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to regulate it</font>

647
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,360
in the wrong way and every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> they try</font>

648
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,160
it's going to cause problems and do what

649
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,560
we're continuing to do that works well

650
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,360
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of seems flippant</font>

651
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,310
but it's a serious question like my head

652
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,800
just spins with the insanity that is

653
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:32,169
most of the ITU and I don't know why we

654
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:33,820
should pander to them so the way I'll

655
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:36,490
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what their answer will be and</font>

656
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,110
i'll go ahead and venture to answer it

657
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,580
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would answer it and that is</font>

658
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,020
the aye<font color="#CCCCCC"> Myint let go back to the very</font>

659
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,939
beginning of the presentation these are

660
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,250
states that<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel that they have</font>

661
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,750
legitimate authority to do this there if

662
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,540
you want to take if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

663
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:51,130
a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> optimistic view it is they feel</font>

664
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,510
like they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> protecting their citizens</font>

665
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,640
they feel like they are they are

666
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,710
preserving the revenue streams that

667
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,930
allow them to continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> serve their</font>

668
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:00,940
populace whether that as you just said

669
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:03,460
in what you're calling flippant I would

670
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,230
not call flippin is but they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

671
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,430
doing it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most efficacious way</font>

672
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:09,450
they're doing it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that they</font>

673
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:12,040
understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it now governments</font>

674
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,630
tradition<font color="#CCCCCC"> and governments have a habit</font>

675
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,330
of reaching for the tools that they are

676
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:18,970
most familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the mechanisms</font>

677
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:22,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are at play in these communities</font>

678
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,860
are very very unfamiliar to them the

679
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,480
whole idea that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these communities</font>

680
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,459
operate that there is some degree of

681
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,110
equitable equitable distribution and

682
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,870
fairness of resources and that these

683
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:33,129
communities actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> create policy</font>

684
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:36,100
that's that's an extraordinary foreign

685
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,390
concept of them sure but you know I'll

686
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,939
sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this day isn't there</font>

687
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:42,730
another model which just says there will

688
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,470
be a distribution of foolish regulation

689
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,000
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the planet with respect to everything</font>

690
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,770
and with respect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the internet and</font>

691
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,810
some places will have insanely

692
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,700
ridiculous counterproductive dumb

693
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:53,379
regulation for moral reasons or

694
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,390
financial reasons and some places will

695
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,980
have a lot less our experience has been

696
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:59,080
that the places<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have a lot less</font>

697
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,100
do a lot better but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just good for</font>

698
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,629
them right it's good for their

699
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,399
development of internet it's good for

700
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,929
business in the society it's good for

701
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,120
the populace it develops new

702
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:09,730
applications people are happier with

703
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ultimately why can't we just do</font>

704
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:13,059
that say yeah you want to restrict stuff

705
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,770
go ahead it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be stupid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

706
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:18,730
expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's going to retard your</font>

707
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:20,379
growth look at your neighbors and figure

708
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">it out right turkey you look at your</font>

00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,650
neighbors and figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out I think</font>

710
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:28,720
you've answered the question I that's

711
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:30,400
that's sure if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take 20 seconds</font>

712
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,679
to respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that just for so everyone</font>

713
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">understands a little reference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

714
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:37,390
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now today governments can make</font>

715
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,879
laws that affect people and

716
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations in their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> territory we know</font>

717
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,179
that governments do that today they

718
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:45,220
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a lot of it with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> respect to the</font>

00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet there's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of road map</font>

720
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,809
for them to work on but some of them are

721
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:51,370
more ambitious and others and and it's

722
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:55,000
all over the globe it's not restricted

723
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:56,649
any part north south east or west bad

724
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,470
internet laws exist pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

725
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:02,140
uniformly but not very many of them the

726
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:05,080
way that tell the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh the IT</font>

727
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,460
works is it's a union<font color="#E5E5E5"> that creates</font>

728
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,070
treaties and those treaties are

729
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:12,669
international governmental treaties when

730
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:16,120
a treaty is adopted then every

731
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:19,480
government passes laws to implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

732
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,799
recommendations of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the treaty so this is</font>

733
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,360
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> different because instead of</font>

734
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,370
every government trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font>

735
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,469
what part of the internet do I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

736
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,439
break with my own laws they get in a

737
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:32,020
room and collectively decide what part

738
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,160
should we all break and the expectation

739
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,280
is that if they come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a decision</font>

740
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:39,790
they'll all pass common laws to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

741
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:43,360
so it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power of individual</font>

742
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:46,000
governments working together to do it

743
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,590
all at once and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact is that if they</font>

744
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,290
do to come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cuckoo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry if</font>

745
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:52,540
they do come to conclusions on things

746
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:55,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be done then there will be</font>

747
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:58,149
enormous pressure for every country to

748
00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:01,240
pass laws that reflect those

749
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:03,760
recommendations because participation is

750
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,370
an all-or-nothing game if you want your

751
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,379
spectrum and you want your satellite

752
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:10,239
orbits then you

753
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:13,420
want to participate in the standards and

754
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,120
follow the recommendations so we sort of

755
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:18,550
have the forcing function of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Treaty</font>

756
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">Organization multiplying what used to be</font>

757
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:26,919
individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> government action does that</font>

758
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:29,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">help sandy Murphy sparta i think i'm</font>

759
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,790
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say just exactly what john just</font>

760
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,189
said it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that one of your</font>

761
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:35,500
slides said one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your slides of the</font>

762
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:38,830
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> recommendation said and you</font>

763
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,690
will write into national law of that you

764
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:43,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">will do these things and that's that's a</font>

765
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:45,520
scary power yes that's that's the that's

766
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:47,949
the standard process of tree to

767
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,379
organizations but as a treaty there is

768
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,910
the option to not sign there's the

769
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,790
treaty yeah there's the option not to

770
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:56,800
participate and John makes a very valid

771
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:59,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">point about radio spectrum and satellite</font>

772
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:02,649
orbits and for some some elements<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

773
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,320
various governments satellite orbits are

774
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:08,170
very salient especially to defense

775
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,550
purposes so that's a so that's so that's

776
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be balanced but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

777
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:13,360
think i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the essence of what i'm</font>

778
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:20,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to get at with this discussion is</font>

779
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:22,419
that economics do drive quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

780
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:25,450
this economics<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what's driving the</font>

781
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:28,060
reaction to skype and other VoIP like

782
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">prop boy black applications and the</font>

783
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">reduction of revenue to certain states</font>

784
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:34,000
that's that's a very driving motive so

785
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,639
how can the my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you and my</font>

786
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,670
hope that what you might take<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from</font>

787
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,750
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can the community in</font>

788
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:43,000
whatever mode you think is most

789
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:44,560
effective go to your state governments

790
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,030
and say you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are already</font>

791
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,590
doing a lot of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're already doing</font>

792
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:50,260
this development process we're already

793
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:52,000
creating a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of creating a fantastic</font>

794
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,070
economic engine for you that will vastly

795
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,960
surpass any amount of revenues you're

796
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:59,770
going to get from the accounting rate

797
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,720
system and so how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as a community</font>

798
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:03,340
provide the information necessary to do

799
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,930
that how can you demonstrate the

800
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,760
positive outcomes of what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

801
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:09,370
here that's that's kind of my answer to

802
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,550
all three of those is there has to be a

803
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:14,979
level of cooperation you you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

804
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:16,360
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> patch on the back you've you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

805
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,390
a really great job<font color="#E5E5E5"> of building this</font>

806
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,129
internet and now you're being justly

807
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,810
rewarded by<font color="#E5E5E5"> States paying attention to</font>

808
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:27,620
you

809
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:29,149
so that's so the question is how can you

810
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,100
how can we move this to the next step

811
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:32,090
because the history of private

812
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Arrangements private governance</font>

813
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:36,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Arrangements</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that states</font>

814
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:40,850
eventually adopt the good of them and so

815
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:42,470
what I'm arguing here is share what good

816
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,149
mechanisms you've identified shared what

817
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:46,420
good ways of reducing information

818
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:50,120
asymmetries and sharing information and

819
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:52,040
developing economic engines you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can with</font>

820
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:57,520
them so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can better benefit from it</font>

821
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:59,450
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I'm out of time so oh</font>

822
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,200
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry there was a quiet I</font>

823
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:04,790
didn't see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question please go ahead</font>

824
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">Marty I was just curious do you have a</font>

825
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:10,149
sense for the current leanings of the

826
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:13,790
say us and canadian reps to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITU um</font>

827
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:15,470
from what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen of the comments to</font>

828
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:18,230
the proposals US and Canada are

829
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:19,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">generally generally have cute little</font>

830
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:23,000
one-liners that say this will not work

831
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:25,550
this is not necessary etc etc so<font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font>

832
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,460
Canada and a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> European states</font>

833
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:31,399
are are generally opposed to most of the

834
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:35,090
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recommendations but then you</font>

835
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:37,640
see other states listing pushing for

836
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:39,590
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> states such as Egypt and the</font>

the UN or the ITU and when these when

841
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:53,419
these slides are posted<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am i'm also</font>

842
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,889
happy if you email me<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm happy to send</font>

you the references that i have for

844
00:33:54,890 --> 00:34:00,920
various articles and discussions just a

845
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,530
quick comment it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ken</font>

and sally wentworth from i sock actually

848
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,279
testified before a congressional

849
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,220
subcommittee on this topic last week and

850
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:15,700
so there's a lot of activity right now

851
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:18,678
related to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this so now's a good time to</font>

852
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:21,408
get those comments out and the second

853
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:25,820
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> which you alluded to we've talked</font>

854
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:27,260
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the context of we can just</font>

855
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,429
ignore them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other thing is if</font>

856
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think in the context of the</font>

00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:32,630
developing<font color="#E5E5E5"> world I think what there's a</font>

858
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,560
potential here<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the segmentation of</font>

859
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,550
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

860
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,620
which i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think is something that we</font>

861
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:38,990
really don't want to see happen and so

862
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:42,409
from a global perspective if we believe

863
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:47,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a global Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

864
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:51,049
something we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to engage in my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meet</font>

865
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:53,179
my my response to that is what what can

866
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,220
this community do to help the developing

867
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">States rather than having them have to</font>

868
00:34:55,219 --> 00:35:00,230
run<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the ITU and say help us what can</font>

869
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:05,620
the community do I think I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of time</font>

870
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:05,620
so I'm happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take this offline thanks</font>
