00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:22,210
there is any there's Andy so Andy is

3
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,100
going to be talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us about Moore's</font>

hours ago math is hard but hopefully

00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">this makes a little bit more</font>

understandable to us engineer types

20
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:15,060
thanks so what's the question vittatus

21
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:18,450
lights work well I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font>

22
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,670
three things<font color="#E5E5E5"> this morning one is the</font>

23
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:24,100
progress that has been made on the

00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,170
semiconductor site otherwise known as

25
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,080
Moore's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Law over the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last many years and</font>

26
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,850
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this relates to networking going</font>

27
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward in particular to the cost</font>

28
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:37,479
performance of networks the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic</font>

29
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:40,240
is how one can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> this technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

30
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:44,710
build scalable networks for large cloud

31
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,509
web data centers and third topic is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

32
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,080
kind of what's happening on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> optics</font>

33
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:53,710
side to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost-effective</font>

34
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:58,630
this religious person<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so jumping</font>

35
00:01:53,710 --> 00:02:01,259
right in with Moore's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Law dr. Moore was</font>

36
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,460
a co-founder of int'l corporation but

37
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,670
the original prediction he made was

38
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:08,769
actually at the expect to 1965 which was

39
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:11,290
the I think that was the year the

40
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:13,599
ARPANET was conceived and this is before

41
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,329
I think they had integrated circuits but

42
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,640
he predicted boldly that the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

43
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,280
transistors<font color="#E5E5E5"> per chip would double every</font>

44
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,470
year this was subsequently revised to

45
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,780
doubling every two years so the current

46
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:27,440
Moore's Law is twice two transistors

47
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,760
every other year

48
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:35,329
and this has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much true for</font>

49
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,870
the last 40 years every<font color="#CCCCCC"> other year this</font>

50
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,850
twice as many transistors on these magic

51
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,480
chips that that drive everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

52
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,799
CPUs to networks now there's a

53
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,530
unfortunate kind of thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font>

54
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the way here which is networks</font>

55

<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't have to look like the past here</font>

anything like this in the history of

years and at least for the next 12 years

87
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:30,070
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get another factor of 100</font>

which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know CPUs 12 years</font>

from now should be hundred times faster

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,870
cheaper whichever way you mentioned this

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe sure where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you measure this and</font>

actually keep going for at least another

20 years which<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be another factor</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of 1,000 beyond what we know of today</font>

103
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:16,979
and the only thing that could kind of

104
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:18,659
happen the on the way there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

105
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:20,789
it does get more and more expensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

if the industry around sort of capital

114
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:40,889
to more cores and CPUs you have seen

double to 16 courses socket to you say

they will double again double again

double again by 2022 should be a

thousand courtship so this is how

129
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:20,609
quickly continuously improving things

130
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:24,240
improve now there's a few things that

144
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,160
and then they stack eight of these days

145
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,170
in the package which makes the 64

your your iphone or ipad but the

148
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,730
progress here is that in the next year

149
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,830
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we would expect it to quadruple</font>

150
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:12,190
and then the quadruple again four years

151
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:15,599
later so the terabyte flash phones or

152
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:19,900
flash chips are just around the corner

153
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:23,200
but to summarize Moore's law here you

154
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,780
know the doubling in transistor count is

155

00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:47,260
up and there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one issue here which is</font>

the Moore's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Law really applies to the</font>

the area on the device which is a square

the maximum throughput per device this

is again a single chip thing and big

00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:01,460
silicon to be fully on moore's law and

286
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:03,350
part of this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the industry hasn't</font>

287
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:06,140
really caught<font color="#CCCCCC"> up on the silicon roadmap</font>

288
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:08,570
in other words int'l is designing 22

290
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,830
shipping silicon is actually 65

291
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:15,980
nanometer so there's a big gap between

292
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the processes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are used in</font>

293
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:21,140
networking chips and the ones that are

295
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,970
needless to say the the cost performance

296
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:28,460
of the system should also improve at the

297
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,360
same rate as the silicon content so we

298
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:34,829
do expect a very rapid in

299
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:37,350
movement in cost performance as well and

300
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:40,290
this is the same chart here<font color="#CCCCCC"> emphasising</font>

301
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:42,480
you know how many transistors are on

00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,130

though you know the ILO does not scale

00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,920
as well as Moore's<font color="#E5E5E5"> law the combination</font>

309
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,899
what the silicon is capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing by</font>

310
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,579
doing full custom designs will actually

get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Spectre point where the chips do</font>

what<font color="#CCCCCC"> silicon enabled enables them to do</font>

313
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:15,839
now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this means on the system side</font>

314
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,029
is that servers themselves have of

335
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,730
from the market researchers of what this

336
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,199
means in terms of data center spending

337
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,060
this is a slide from a company called

the data center even as of this year the

vast majority of network spend is in

fact 10 gigabit connections with 40

344

gigabit expected to show up in say 2015

346

so again the bulk of future spending is

believed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the 1040 and eventually</font>

are also getting big and bigger and

368
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,880
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that next so second</font>

369
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,980
part of my talk is what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

370
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,189
happening in the cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> and these large</font>

371
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,350
data centers people are building to

372
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:48,310
deliver cloud services to consumers and

373
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:52,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll use two examples here one is our</font>

374
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:54,859
our Arista 7050<font color="#E5E5E5"> ragtop switch this is</font>

375
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:58,280
the one with the 64 port single silicon

376
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:00,610
doing you know 1.28 terabits throughput

377
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,959
at a typical power of 2 watts per port

378
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:05,780
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is our modular</font>

379
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:08,589
chassis switch which is 384 ports 10 gig

380
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:12,250
non-blocking with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 terabit fabric</font>

381
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:16,250
now there's two ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scale networks</font>

382
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:18,530
easily one is at layer 2 with<font color="#E5E5E5"> M lag</font>

383
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:23,569
which is all red for multi chassis lack

384
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:25,910
we essentially take two of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7500</font>

385
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:29,240
switches and make them as Siamese twins

386
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:32,780
so they behave like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single arrow to</font>

387
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,310
the 1d bridge for forwarding but there

388
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,678
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really two separate switches if one</font>

389
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:39,320
feels stale one takes over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

390
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:41,780
works well for small clusters up to you

391
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,939
know the equivalent of two of these big

392
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,160
switches the other one is at layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3</font>

393
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:50,270
using equal cost multipath load

394
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,520
balancing on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> PGP so the layer to</font>

395
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:54,980
design is quite popular

396
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,900
or building Hadoop clusters that are in

397
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,530
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of racks what other things</font>

398
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:03,380
where people want the flat layer to kind

<font color="#E5E5E5">of network and this works today no</font>

proprietary fabric required here and

401
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:09,770
gets people about 20 terabytes of

402
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,510
throughput for the size of these

403
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,129
clusters which could scale up to

404
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:16,970
hundreds of miles of racks but<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically</font>

here in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a better</font>

but the simple design guide is you know

427
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,419
you start with the requirement on the

428
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:20,030
pot size and the bandwidth per server

429
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:22,250
which is determines the total cluster

430
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:24,290
bandwidth and then you select the degree

431
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,750
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecp redundancy required you know</font>

432
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:28,340
anywhere from four to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 32 way and that</font>

433
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,980
determines the vendors response which

434
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,860
and then you connect it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all together and</font>

435
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the clusters so people</font>

436
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,750
are very careful to optimize this for

437
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:40,840
all costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> per bandwidth per server but</font>

438
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:46,630
this is how you know some of the largest

439
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:49,399
websites out there have been built now

440
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:51,500
the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> topic of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course is you know</font>

441
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,010
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it make sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go from 10</font>

442
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:57,230
gigabit 240 gigabit to honey gigabit and

443
00:19:54,010 --> 00:20:00,740
one important notion here is the notion

444
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:02,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">of cost performance at the bandwidth</font>

445
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,370
level which otherwise one can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of</font>

446
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,669
as a utility function

447
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:09,739
and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenges is that 14</font>

448
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">hanukkah give it today cost more than</font>

00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,330
the corresponding number of 10 gig ports

450
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,130
so our and our largest customers looking

454
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:27,020
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a lot of sense to deployed</font>

455
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:28,700
and this is a little bit unfortunate in

456
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,889
a sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the I Triple E standards</font>

457
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,410

459
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:37,850
believe but as of today you know the

460
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:41,270
cost per port is still higher than the

461
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,469
acronym of tangy ports the 40 gigs is

462
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,059
actually getting there but in the case

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> honey give it its vastly more</font>

464
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:49,550

the optics<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost which is certainly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> honey</font>

467
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,300

these optics and again the typical leaf

then 400 gigabit we have a similar

silicon photonics which is building the

<font color="#CCCCCC">not in the current I chip released in it</font>

fiber so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're familiar with</font>

585

parallel fiber which is you put multiple

these parallel fibers are very dense

00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,030
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this very unfortunate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> situation</font>

just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is so think of it as</font>

hundred meters in the existing cables

656
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:19,410
but if you want multi hundred meters

657
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:22,500
distances or or cheaper overall cabling

658
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:24,810
you will have to convert<font color="#E5E5E5"> the overall</font>

659
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,430
total here it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little hard to say</font>

660
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:28,889
because the silicon photonics haven't

00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:32,400
shipped yet it's generally predicted

662
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:34,440
that they are less expensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> than even</font>

667
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,649
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Ripley meetings</font>

costs because there would be

anti-competitive for antitrust I don't

672
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:57,360
it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious what's happening</font>

673

here now to sum this up basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sigma</font>

vastly cheaper than multimode

681
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:18,929
unfortunately again most installed base

682
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:20,280
is the multimode fiber and having fewer

683
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:23,160
connections is good thing too because

684
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,660
it's much less confusing then what's

685
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,980
going on today where I didn't want to

here over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next couple of years we we</font>

with but what is happening is that it's

723
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,490
basically cheaper to put more chips on

than 250 watts per one you in some cases

741

significantly less so so the switches

00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:21,680
this fascinating comparison between<font color="#E5E5E5"> ASIC</font>

design and custom chip design and the

<font color="#E5E5E5">implication of the discussion as i heard</font>

752
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:28,290
it was the many many years of asic

753
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,850
design was just a horrible mistake that

754
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,230
was made over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the course of the very</font>

long

757
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:36,470
there was any good reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

758
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:39,470
did this can you comment on why why it

759
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:42,169
was such a long-lived mistake in ship

760
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:44,960
and system design<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet that's a very good</font>

761
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:48,650
point ASIC design is much cheaper than

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">full custom so in a sick world I don't</font>

763
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,220
know if loot numbers here but it's

764
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:54,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably a quarter of the cost and</font>

765
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">effort compared to do a full custom chip</font>

766
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:58,280
and part of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how many chips are</font>

767
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:00,620
you ever going to make how many chips

768
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,149
are you going to sell so full custom has

769
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,639
been applied<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the higher volume</font>

770
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:06,080
opportunities and you know if a router

771
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,429
has so many chips but the company only

772
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,129
sell so many routers you can't actually

773
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:12,080
quite justified so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trade-off</font>

774
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:15,830
in design cost versus optimizing on the

775
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,810
silicon side but as 10 gigabit volumes

776
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:19,940
in particular and the ethernet has been

777
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:22,940
the highest volume thing in the market

778
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,679
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the what the industry has done</font>

779
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,840
and all the vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing is to</font>

really deliver the optimal performance

782
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,270
for that so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a little harder on</font>

783
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:37,100
the traditional you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know exotic kind of</font>

785
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,509
people are not generally doing full

custom chips for those type of devices

787
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,750
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really benefits the higher volume</font>

788

isn't it more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the traditional</font>

you know most traffic is packet-based

that buffering is not as big<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an issue</font>

918
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:06,190
but with jumbo frames I don't have a

00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:20,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very important topic and the</font>

is for the single chip the chip designs

00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:29,350
wherever the entire switches on one died

929
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:31,900
there's a very tight constraint in terms

sails it is actually almost a billion

934
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:44,230
transistors just for that s turn buffer

935
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:46,660
and then the other logic right so that

936
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:49,240
that's stretching the single chip

937
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,129
designs and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> then build a class</font>

938
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,359
networks out of these individual chips

939
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:56,020
it's still the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same buffer overall</font>

940
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:58,540
there's another type of chip design that

941
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,130
uses external drm for buffering in which

942
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,920
case the buffer is essentially infinite

943
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,869
compared to the single chip and this is

944
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,119
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use on the modular chassis where</font>

945
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:10,440
you know it's at least 50 if not 100

946
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:12,430
milliseconds worth of buffering / / port

947
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,770
similar to what traditional routers have

948
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:17,560
done now the trade office that those

949
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:19,180
chips need like half the pins to hook up

950
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,090
to the drm<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get the same</font>

951
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:23,169
port density to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> front facing port</font>

952
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:25,540
and then they typically fabric

953
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:27,340
interfaces so the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ports for</font>

954
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:30,009
the chips that support<font color="#CCCCCC"> the external drm</font>

955
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:32,470
buffer is much lower than the signature

956
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,410
designs and a result of systems tend to

957
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:35,359

00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,380

percentile response time rather than and

1005
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:23,630
having the buffers delay because

1006
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,490
variance is what kills their workload

1007
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:28,580
right so in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> it then small</font>

this very nice feature<font color="#E5E5E5"> for managing the</font>

1030
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,990
guess in this case it was essentially

1031
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:27,780
switched so I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that concept I</font>

what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah I was</font>

1035
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:39,129
particular idea and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time this was</font>

1036
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:41,560
you know 1998 so a long time ago the

1037
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:43,839
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> rach was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> red which stood for</font>

1038
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:46,690
random early drop right so the notion

1039
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:49,900
was if one drops packets randomly that

1040
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:51,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe less maybe better than over</font>

1041
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:54,460
running the buffers and dropping a whole

1042
00:44:51,339 --> 00:44:55,869
bunch at once so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people at Cisco the</font>

switches only to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find out that is when</font>

1045

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn on red you would never hit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1046
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:06,040
you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the extra performance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font>

1047
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:07,390
without dropping packets because it

1048
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:09,579
would almost drop packets by definition

1049
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:10,900
but this is what red does so as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1050
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:12,369
that became clear everybody turned off

1051
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,069
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because it wouldn't look good on</font>

1052
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:17,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the performance tests and the essential</font>

1053
00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:20,109
problem was that it isn't actually the

1054
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:22,540
the mix of TCP flows but what we then

1055
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:24,940
called ill-behaved flows basically if

1056
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:27,099
somebody just injects<font color="#E5E5E5"> this UDP you know</font>

1057
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:29,410
either unicast multicast it never stops

1058
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,940
right which one consumes all buffers

1059
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:33,430
because it just takes over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the switch</font>

1060
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:36,099
then it penalizes all the other things

1061
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:37,359
that may be going on and the fairest

1062
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:40,119
thing to do would be simply look on a

1063
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:42,640
per flow basis of allocating spreading

1064
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:46,359
out this you know this valuable buffer

1065
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,799
memory on a more equal dynamic basis to

1066
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:50,140
the flow so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually want to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1067
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:51,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that no flow gets too much into</font>

1068
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:54,000
little and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1069
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:55,620
notion of dynamic buffer limiting and

1070
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,690
that worked really well in fact that

1071
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,609
particular product was one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

1073
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:02,940
the part of this was its performance

1074
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,190
characteristics and you know people

1075
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,200
never had an issue with buffer on that

1076
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,670
particular product but that product

1077
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,250
still had vastly more buffer than a

1078
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">single chip designs today so the buffer</font>

1079
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:17,850
amount on a catalyst 4948 is about 50

1080
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,770
milliseconds per gige port compared to

1081
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the single chip designs which have</font>

1082
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:25,830
basically one TCP window pure port which

1083
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:27,480
is nothing red so the the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> buffets on</font>

1084
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:30,720
the single chip<font color="#E5E5E5"> designs are in fact very</font>

1085
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:33,030
very small and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment they get</font>

1086
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,620
overrun things will drop and the only

1087
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:35,910
way around this is to use access

1088
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,359
submission flow control at the leaf

1089
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:40,859
layer which people use and that works

1090
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:43,650
reasonably<font color="#E5E5E5"> well but at the spine layer</font>

1091
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:46,230
it's it's much more touchy so so when

1092
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:48,420
your point B I guess your assertion be

1093
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:51,270
that they're so small to<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin with any</font>

1096
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:57,030
be of any benefit no no so what happens

1097
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:59,400
today is the big<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote for the sense use</font>

1098
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:01,860
drm and just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know vast amount</font>

1099
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,810
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> theorems to over provision buffering</font>

1100
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,520
the small ones are so small that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1101
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:07,410
couldn't actually allocate the buffer on

1102
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,620
a per flow basis because it's not enough

1103
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:12,210
buffers on these flows so it would work

1104
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,589
with a medium sized buffer but that

1105
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:17,100
doesn't fit on a single chip today so

1106
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:19,860
it's not being used today I think we are

1107
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:21,900
running out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at last we are</font>
