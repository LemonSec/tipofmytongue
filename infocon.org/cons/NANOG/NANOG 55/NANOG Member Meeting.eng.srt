48
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:30,530
not subject to high fluctuations we

49
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,690
decided then that what we needed to do

50
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:36,130
as an organization was to be a

51
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:38,600
sustainable financially and also being

52
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:41,299
perceived as a credible long-term

53
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,549
investment for our funders we also

54
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,380
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to increase the relevance while</font>

55
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:48,260
maintaining the neutrality of nanog

58
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:58,610
and also early career network operators

59
00:03:54,710 --> 00:04:01,900
we had noticed that our attendees were

60
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:04,820
aging and we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to grow the ranks</font>

61
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,310
and also we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage our noon</font>

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,740
the three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years so the first year was a</font>

67
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:26,989
transition phase and you have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

68
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,540
heard us talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transition phase</font>

69
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:32,240
a transition phase we're almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

70
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,700
actually it was just one item that's not

71
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,140
done what we had committed there was to

72
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:42,260
be financially<font color="#E5E5E5"> sustainable we did that</font>

73
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,450
we also wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue our operation</font>

74
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,780
and you told us don't break it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we didn't</font>

75
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:50,740
break it we contracted staff and we

76
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,760
contracted systems and we also

77
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,900
communicated to you what we were doing

78
00:04:52,760 --> 00:05:01,730

and 57 is our construction year so what

80
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:06,200
we need here to do is continue our

81
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,380
financial plan and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that we are</font>

87
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:28,760
worthy of your volunteering time we are

88
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,190
working on a program reformat<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk</font>

91
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:40,940
opportunity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> either bring changes to</font>

92
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:45,289
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> the committee's are to our bylaws</font>

93
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,940

96
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:57,350
phase so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a quarter million</font>

97
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:59,990
in reserve we will have made good

98
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:03,470
progress for engaging early in

99
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:06,050
mid-career networkers we will have an

100
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:09,350
education program on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way a website</font>

101
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:14,270
redesigned and continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you</font>

102
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:16,820
with every every means we have metrics

103
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,770
for success we when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> August</font>

104
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:22,490
who said it would be pointless to make a

105
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:25,299
plan if we were not able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> track it and</font>

106
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:29,780
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we were making progress</font>

107
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:35,240
so we did put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few metrics down and we</font>

108
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:37,099
wanted our members to renew so it was a

109
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,900
good indication for us today if your

110
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,020
members renewed their

111
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:45,590
their membership it meant that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they</font>

112
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:49,219
adhere to<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog so we have success there</font>

113
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:51,710
but not everyone has renewed we have

114
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:54,800
increased new memberships yes we have

115
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:56,330

116
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,400
achieved<font color="#E5E5E5"> our all of our financial</font>

117
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:03,430
targets we have also according to the

118
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,070
survey data we've maintained our

119
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:11,870
communications in our image and we have

120
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:15,530
growth a lot our sponsorship and we have

121
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:19,280
produced great content and this is what

122
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:23,690
you say via the survey so that's our

123
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:26,239
metrics we have a lot to be done still

124
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:31,130
we're not done so you've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> the three</font>

125
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:35,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">year plan some of us are terming some of</font>

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:45,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay at this point I'll pass it on to</font>

148
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:49,959
Dave and they will present the Monday

149
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,959
Wednesday program proposal

150
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:02,550
afternoon so some of you may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font>

151
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,250
over I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two surveys where</font>

152
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,680
we put in a question asking whether

153
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,839
people would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us move to a</font>

154
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">Monday to wednesday program instead of</font>

155
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,519
the current where we're at today which

156
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,500
is beginning the program on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sunday</font>

157
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:20,070
afternoon with tutorials<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

158
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">finishing Wednesday morning survey</font>

159
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,800
results<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been positive in favor of</font>

160
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:28,859
moving to that and so we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

161
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">present what our vision is and solicit</font>

162
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,480
feedback either here you're welcome to

163
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,610
get to the mic and provide us with

164
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,970
direct feedback we're also going to

165
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:44,459
include this on the survey for this

166
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:46,709
meeting so one of the biggest concerns

167
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:49,170
of people had is that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have</font>

168
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:51,060
their weekends they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

169
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,819
attend the content that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've programmed</font>

170
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,579
for you but they also don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

171
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,620
to leave in some cases on saturday

172
00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:02,719
morning in order to get here at a<font color="#CCCCCC"> decent</font>

173
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:07,430
time for for sunday afternoon tutorial

174
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:11,430
you know at the simplest<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of it</font>

175
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:13,529
basically people would much rather from

176
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:17,010
what we've talked about thus far<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

177
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:18,540
would much rather come here<font color="#E5E5E5"> during what</font>

178
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,670
they consider to be their business<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours</font>

179
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:24,089
because this is a business focus

180
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:27,270
conference more so<font color="#E5E5E5"> than on their</font>

181
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:29,430
personal time the other thing we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font>

182
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:32,370
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wednesday mornings especially</font>

183
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,520
depending on meeting location tend to

184
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:37,829
ebb and flow depending on what flight

185
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,810
schedules look like out of that area and

186
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:44,160
so instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of putting pressure on people</font>

187
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:46,829
to either a<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to stay an extra day or</font>

188
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,689
be leave and miss the content that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

189
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:50,729
programmed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> wednesday morning we'd</font>

190
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:54,870
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make that a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit simpler</font>

191
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:56,850
for everyone another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

192
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,950
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have is a request for a</font>

193
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,360
better track lay

194
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,140
people don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to choose</font>

195
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,430
between as much content as they do

196
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,350
you'll see this meeting we're actually

197
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,030
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other extreme where we only have one</font>

198
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:11,210
track per day but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

199
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:13,000
the norm but people<font color="#E5E5E5"> really don't want to</font>

200
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:17,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to choose between three things</font>

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,610
especially when given the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know very</font>

202
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:24,770
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> close-up focus of this</font>

203
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:26,300
conference the three things<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to</font>

204
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:30,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">choose between are generally very</font>

205
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:32,780
similar as most of you in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

206
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,760
peering track is very popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

207
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:37,610
know we repeatedly have requests from

208
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,860
from other moderators<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tracks to not</font>

209
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:44,960
conflict with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

210
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:47,780
easy to do that the third thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

211
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,690
we'd like to add a policy track and this

212
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:53,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">was suggested by Aaron be programmed by</font>

213
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,130
Aaron and also by other rirs and this

214
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:59,810
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> give us the flexibility to be able</font>

215
00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:01,520
to do that what we would do is we've

216
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,250
moved to a program<font color="#E5E5E5"> that begins Monday</font>

217
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:07,370
morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> with tutorials we would kick off</font>

218
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:10,100
the keynote after lunch peirong track

219
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,560
moves to wednesday afternoon by itself

220
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:16,670
and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mentioned before we add a</font>

221
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:20,119
standing policy track it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little hard</font>

222
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:21,229
to read you can download this deck off

223
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,030
of the website look at it a little

224
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,680
closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this is what the program</font>

225
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:29,180
looks like today in its<font color="#E5E5E5"> most simplistic</font>

226
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:32,079
form I don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into details but</font>

227
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:35,689
it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> chunked up pretty evenly</font>

228
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,580
what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposing is and just to back</font>

229
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:40,790
up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> real quick basically this is</font>

230
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">four days total of content that we're</font>

231
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:45,380
programmed programming at this point

232
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:48,080
we're proposing is going to a three-day

233
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:50,450
format where we effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jam all</font>

234
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">three days a lot more full again this</font>

235
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:55,550
gives you that extra day to travel

236
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:58,850
instead of trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> jam in additional</font>

237
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:00,620
content but it does make the first day a

238
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:07,340
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> full day if you choose to</font>

239
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:09,670
travel in for the tracks small metric to

240
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,890
give everyone we've programmed about

241
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:15,910
thousand twenty unique minutes of

242
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:18,490
content for this meeting we hit about

243
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:22,000
ten percent more program with the with

244
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the proposed changes we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ask</font>

245
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,930
this one more time we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put it</font>

246
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the survey for this meeting if we</font>

247
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:31,120
still get a majority what will<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen is</font>

248
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:33,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the board will vote on it the board</font>

249
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,310
votes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the affirmative for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it will</font>

250
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:42,340
make this change for now 57 which is in

251
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:45,040
orlando next<font color="#CCCCCC"> February's again welcome</font>

252
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:48,610
any questions comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

253
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:55,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">to speak now hold it to later or email</font>

254
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:57,610
myself email<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bragg email the pc Randy</font>

255
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:01,120
bhushan i J could you put the proposed

256
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:09,400
new up back just for a sec could you

257
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:14,530
move the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dome general session exchange</font>

258
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:17,980
it with a policy track we could

259
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,720
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider that this is this</font>

260
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,530
shouldn't be considered the the final

261
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">layout this is proposed there's going to</font>

262
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,329
be logistic reasons logistical reasons

263
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:30,700
just like here for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the</font>

264
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:32,410
peering track is actually on Monday this

265
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,510
meeting instead of on Tuesday just

266
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,040
programming note for everyone there's

267
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,400
always TV logistical reasons why we may

268
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,110
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to slide this around a little bit</font>

269
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:44,050
Steve hey Steve Feldman<font color="#E5E5E5"> to CBS</font>

270
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,910
interactive probably a more important

271
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,520
question for a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people is where</font>

272
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:52,180
does a beer and gear fit in this you

273
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:55,060
know it's funny I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually took off</font>

274
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,890
so the this would be a very effective

275
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,589
target right now it'd be impossible to

276
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">read if I left the social times in</font>

277
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:03,130
basically everything still fits on

278
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:06,010
either end of it the same way it does

279
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:08,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that did before what this does allow us</font>

280
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,420
to do is potentially have or we still

281
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,150
have three socials you could have a much

282
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:16,209
smaller welcome social on Sunday night

283
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">and actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have four I actually had</font>

284
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:18,660
another

285
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,639
more of an observation than a question

286
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,309
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is having done this for many years</font>

287
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">my observation has always been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that no</font>

288
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:27,059
matter what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan people are going to</font>

289
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:34,559
leave early on that last day and there's

290
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:38,329
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> no way around it really just didn't</font>

291
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,329
hear this question<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh apparently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

292
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:57,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if there's nothing further I'm</font>

293
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:59,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to hand it to Steve hi so one of</font>

294
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:02,040
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

295
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,589
as as we go forward with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanog</font>

296
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:10,079
transition is to make me on again to

297
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:12,059
more than just a conference and so we so

298
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,979
we've been talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about doing an</font>

299
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:16,920
educational program much like what

300
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,720
happens in many of the nugs in the rest

301
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,269
of the world where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly people in</font>

302
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,029
the week before the conference and teach

303
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:25,230
some classes so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start talking</font>

304
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:26,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that I wanted to put a disclaimer</font>

305
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,910
on this to say you know it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

306
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:31,170
preliminary proposal something that the

307
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,910
board has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

308
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit it hasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been very thoroughly</font>

309
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,319
vetted there's still a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work to do</font>

310
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:39,660
but I wanted to just bring the community

311
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:42,378
up to speed and what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now and</font>

312
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:47,579
hopefully solicit some input and help

313
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:49,649
with planning and so forth so as I said

314
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:52,349
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other regional network</font>

315
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:55,050
operators groups offer training programs

316
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:59,339
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would be you know rather</font>

317
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:02,459
than you know ccie or juniper runs at<font color="#E5E5E5"> j</font>

318
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:04,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">&</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cie or i think there's even a mikrotik</font>

319
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:06,448
certified training course for people who

320
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:09,449
want to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to operate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

321
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:12,809
little home mikrotik routers this would

322
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:15,000
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more focused on how do you build your</font>

323
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:17,129
own you know how do you do sort of whole

324
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,679
network design and you know pick fenders

325
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,000
and you know build something that's

326
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,159
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to work rather than how</font>

327
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,220
do i configure my cisco for that

328
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:29,200
and by<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it through Nana it would be</font>

329
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,730
you know a chance for you know those of

330
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,580
us who have been doing this for a long

331
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,289
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share our knowledge with the</font>

333
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:39,580
engineers and you know bring new blood

334
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:44,469
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry and the nanog</font>

335
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:46,240
organization so why nanog for this you

336
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:49,179
know the vendors obviously have a strong

337
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,549
motive for training people to do things

338
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:54,760
with their own equipment were a neutral

339
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:57,070
forum education is part of our

<font color="#E5E5E5">nonprofit charity in the US and there</font>

342
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,400
are a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways you can qualify for</font>

343
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,100
that we qualified for that by being an

344
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,360
educational organization and you know

345
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,299
our conferences there certainly

346
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,939
educational content but it would be nice

347
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:17,379
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> more for that we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">networks you know we seemed like the</font>

natural group of people to be setting

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:31,239
the educational standards for this and

354
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,379
you know and it's a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring in new</font>

people as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our you know our</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what would we end up covering here you</font>

know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number of topics and you</font>

360
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:47,500
know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those things that's</font>

361
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,000
still very much in<font color="#CCCCCC"> influx but you know</font>

362
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,970
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some ideas routing network</font>

363
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,620
architecture knock operations network

364
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:59,740
security you know ipv6 that sort of

365
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,959
thing what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it look like you know</font>

366
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,330
first of all obviously you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

367
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,179
to curriculum and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually have</font>

368
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,439
to start from<font color="#CCCCCC"> scratch on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this because</font>

369
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:10,150
all of these other<font color="#CCCCCC"> nogs that are doing</font>

370
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,470
this already have curriculums and there

371
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,030
are a bunch of organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

372
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,299
already teaching these classes for those

373
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:18,280
other operations group so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we can</font>

374
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:21,520
borrow pretty heavily from that and

375
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:24,820
either use their material or adopt or

376
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,960
adapt it to be you know more relevant to

377
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,129
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanodegree gen if there are</font>

378
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,330
differences<font color="#CCCCCC"> between what we're doing</font>

379
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:33,070
here and what they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> already over</font>

380
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:35,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">there format</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was what many of the other</font>

381
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">nugs are doing is week long sessions</font>

00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,999
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> their meeting</font>

383
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:41,409
where you'll fly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know often it ends</font>

384
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:44,049
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fly the beginners in the week</font>

385
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:45,429
before teach them the classes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

386
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,929
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the week they fly home and</font>

387
00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:48,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">their bosses show up and that's kind of</font>

388
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:50,950
unfortunate it would be nice to get them

389
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:54,129
to stick<font color="#E5E5E5"> around but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that may be</font>

390
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:56,909
inevitable we need to pay for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow</font>

391
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:59,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want it to take away</font>

392
00:19:56,909 --> 00:20:01,809
resources from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the nanog</font>

393
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,559
program so we'd probably end up being a

394
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:07,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">combination of paying tuition and you</font>

395
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:11,379
know getting grants or sponsorship<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

396
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:13,658
cover portions of it and we would

397
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:16,119
ideally have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it be taught by volunteers</font>

398
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:18,609
from the community either nanog people

399
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:20,738
or you know perhaps some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

400
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:27,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations that are doing this for</font>

401
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:27,269
the nugs in the rest of the world so

402
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:37,929
let's see I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I intended to delete</font>

403
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:40,779
the slide sorry so so you know then

404
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:42,220
there's the budget issue with it ideally

405
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:44,109
some costs would be covered by sponsors

406
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:50,859
otherwise it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to be tuition paid by</font>

407
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:53,590
the attendees and we looked at putting

408
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:54,850
together cost model on this so it looks

409
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,129
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be a total of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about ninety</font>

410
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,379
thousand dollars if we were to do three

411
00:20:57,129 --> 00:21:01,389
simultaneous<font color="#E5E5E5"> five-day 30 student</font>

412
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:02,889
workshops and you know obviously if we

413
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:05,529
just fed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the budget</font>

414
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:06,908
numbers go up and down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty thousand</font>

415
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:09,220
dollars of that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hotel food and</font>

416
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:11,739
beverage assuming that we do assuming

417
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:15,100
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use hotel meeting rooms to put</font>

418
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:17,190
these on so hotel economics is weird and

419
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,029
perhaps if we were to partner with

420
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,759
universities or someone else who had

421
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:22,779
space we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the costs down more</font>

422
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:25,600
that comes out to about a thousand

423
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:27,609
dollars per student which assuming we do

424
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,178
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality program is probably worth</font>

425
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:33,189
paying for so what next obviously this

426
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:35,859
is still very preliminary and there's a

427
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:38,529
lot still work out board and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> program</font>

428
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:41,439
committee are both taking a look at this

429
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:42,970
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up with more ideas and you</font>

430
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,009
know any feedback we get from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

431
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,119
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> or ideally people volunteering</font>

432
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:49,899
to help with this together would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

433
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:56,209
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks</font>

434
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:58,789
and looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> randy has questions where</font>

435
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:05,380
any Bush<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raj as someone who's been doing</font>

436
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:05,379
this for around 25 years yes thank you

437
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:17,779
now invite steve Feldman to come and

438
00:22:13,179 --> 00:22:26,270
talk about elections and bylaws and what

439
00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:28,010
we should look at changing we treated

440
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,330
Steve's here actually for this usually

441
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:32,179
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> iffy Steve who worries about by</font>

442
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:34,279
loss so I'm Steve Feldman they were /

443
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:37,700
CBS interactive<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other official</font>

444
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:40,360
title yay but I did volunteer to help

445
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,850
out this year with putting together

446
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,370
bylaws changes amendments whatever for

447
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the election that's coming up this fall</font>

448
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:50,600
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating under this current</font>

449
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,760
set of bylaws for I don't how long a

450
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:55,879
year and a half now it's worked out

451
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,070
pretty well but there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably just</font>

452
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,820
Minh that need to be made<font color="#CCCCCC"> and things</font>

453
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:02,809
like that is we've gained experience so

454
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:06,529
what I want to do is act as a

455
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:09,049
facilitator not not be the one actually

456
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:12,260
writing the changes box<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pug will write</font>

457
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:13,760
them that's an editor but not as a nut

458
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:17,059
creating content I want you guys to do

459
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,390
that for me all<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the board</font>

460
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:23,090
you guys members and whatever else so

461
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,289
the main goals as I see it this is my

462
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,770
personal opinion about the boards

463
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:29,870
anybody else's we need to ensure our

464
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:34,190
nonprofit status and educational mission

465
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:36,350
so whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in the bylaws can't break</font>

466
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,179
that in any way we defined the right

467
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:41,449
balance between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the boards flexibility</font>

468
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:42,919
and memberships oversight I think there

469
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:44,270
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some areas right now where the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> board</font>

470
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:46,669
is too constrained<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what they can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

471
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:49,940
and maybe some areas where it's too much

472
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:51,340
the other way so into we think all of

473
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,250
those given

474
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:57,260
experience for the last couple years the

475
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,820
document itself isn't very well

476
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,080
organized<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was just reading through it</font>

477
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,790
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> today and realize that there's</font>

478
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,299
some stuff in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Section eight that talks</font>

479
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,678
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff in Section 13</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on and</font>

480
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:09,490
just by rearranging it probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> made it</font>

481
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:11,630
make a lot more readable and useful

482
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,919
there are things in there they're

483
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably don't even belong in a bylaws</font>

484
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:16,850
document that are just way too

485
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,889
micromanagement of what an organization

486
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:23,299
like this should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing less you get</font>

487
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:25,070
removed one possible ideas to move those

488
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:26,929
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a separate policies and</font>

489
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:30,620
procedures document like France and

490
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:33,940
Aaron I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know done for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> theirs and then</font>

491
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:36,639
there's a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue of do we want to</font>

492
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,870
tweak<font color="#CCCCCC"> the what's in the current bylaws</font>

493
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,270
move this to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and so on just a</font>

494
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:43,178
series<font color="#E5E5E5"> of changes of diffs or write a</font>

495
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,080
whole new document start<font color="#CCCCCC"> over with</font>

496
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:47,030
probably nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer to that until</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

497
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,870
see this cup of the changes that we want

498
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:53,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make they're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a couple of</font>

499
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:57,168
contentious items<font color="#E5E5E5"> I imagine as we go</font>

500
00:24:53,570 --> 00:25:00,379
through their big issue like I said

501
00:24:57,169 --> 00:25:02,600
before is how much discretion is the

502
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">board going to have versus how much</font>

503
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:07,129
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be approved by the membership</font>

504
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:09,440
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the balances are a little</font>

505
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:12,950
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> places there but I don't</font>

506
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">think they're too far off one item I</font>

507
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:17,809
keep hearing about a lot from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of</font>

508
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:19,370
different directions as term limits the

509
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:22,040
reasons why each term limits are there

510
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:24,889
made are obvious for anybody who's been

511
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:28,309
read long enough do they still<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply</font>

512
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:31,910
today or do we lose flexibility by

513
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:36,260
forcing<font color="#E5E5E5"> people out amazing continuity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

514
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:38,540
the board that's a question I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

515
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:44,059
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot about a lot of opinions on</font>

516
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:46,909
from people issues of committee

517
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:48,710
composition right now the bylaws<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

518
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:50,540
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> composition of</font>

519
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:55,190
some committees and say very little

520
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:56,510
about others we should probably to some

521
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,710
extent figure out which committees are

522
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,720
really the important ones and codify

523
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,830
them to the extent they need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

524
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,720
then leave the rest of the board's

525
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:05,800
discretion to do the right thing

526
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,420
things like numbers of members of

527
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,830
committees and how they're selected and

528
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:14,110
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long the terms are and things like</font>

529
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:16,419
that maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to be as a set in</font>

530
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:18,250
stone as they are currently another

531
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,380
question has come up over the years is

532
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:23,710
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we should allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

533
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,600
possibility of a midterm<font color="#CCCCCC"> election or</font>

534
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:28,890
whatever you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it to enact</font>

535
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,330
bylaws changes when it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not october</font>

536
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:36,910
we've heard varying opinions of that one

537
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:39,189
as well so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are my my broad list of</font>

538
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:42,010
things that I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to think</font>

539
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:44,470
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to put this on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nod</font>

540
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,929
members list or members at whatever we

541
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:49,270
called maybe then I features two to get

542
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:52,780
people interested of course to vote you

543
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:54,639
need to be a member so plug for that and

544
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:57,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">otherwise thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and i look forward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

545
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,410
this discussion and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

546
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,149
could have something that we have

547
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:03,760
community consists consensus on that we

548
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:09,130
can stick on the ballot in<font color="#CCCCCC"> October thank</font>

549
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:10,870
you anybody any questions for me now or

550
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:13,090
we want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and yell about it</font>

551
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:18,239
during the open mic recession that's

552
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:18,240
fine too<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right thanks</font>

553
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:30,320
hmm beer<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so we have we run sorry</font>

554
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,970
sorry Randy asked what's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite</font>

555
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,370
forum for discussion which i think is a

556
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,840
good and serious question I think Betty

557
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,219
said which you can't hear because you

558
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,120
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> her microphone on because I</font>

559
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:43,370
turned it off on purpose was that

560
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:47,689
futures at noon org which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve also</font>

561
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:49,610
mentioned members at well both I think

562
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:53,030
futures is actually a more appropriate

563
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:56,389
forum as that is where we discussed the

564
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:57,500
future of nanog right my comment was the

565
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:59,750
beer and gear is probably my favorite

566
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:09,110
forum to discuss the futures of nanog

567
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:12,850
but it's up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve said</font>

568
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:12,850
something nobody heard so let's move on

569
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:23,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yes so we we do have 25 minutes so</font>

570
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:26,270
we you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an open floor you can ask</font>

571
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:28,490

595
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:25,970
thought maybe it was just a system

596
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,529
memory we're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> working out some bugs</font>

00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:44,480
list of upcoming membership for renewals

604
00:29:41,899 --> 00:29:46,489

605
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,830
staff to each of you reminding you that

606

compliment which is I think this

611
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:18,408
organizations moved a long way and is

612
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:23,299
acting almost like a normal small

613
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:24,890
organization and that's depressing I'm

614
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:28,600
sure for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people who have to do it</font>

615
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:33,919
and good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those of us who rely on it</font>

00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:51,350

621
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:55,130
throw it all up on members or futures or

622
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:58,520
whatever it's going to be hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal</font>

00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:58,369
and openness in a view of top-down

00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:01,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet governance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again that's nothing</font>

714
00:34:58,369 --> 00:35:04,069
you're going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> junior folks into</font>

715
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:05,750
the fold with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tutorial track the</font>

716
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:08,839
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve was discussing his</font>

717
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:11,089
critically important because when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Philip</font>

718
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:15,650
Smith would do his introduction to PGP

719
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:20,799
that was so important when<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped me</font>

720
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:20,800
with his name the the nut<font color="#CCCCCC"> berkowitz but</font>

721
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:26,569
Howard there was an old<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy used to come</font>

722
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:29,598
to nanog who did there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a wonderful</font>

723
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:32,450
teacher he would do tutorials what's

724
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Berkowitz yes Berkowitz they were</font>

725
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:36,770
wonderful<font color="#E5E5E5"> tutorials and these things</font>

726
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,078
made these meetings accessible and if

727
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:42,770
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tie in accessible learning</font>

728
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,210
activities into the meeting then all of

729
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:45,920
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden you have a junior network</font>

730
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:49,220
engineer who might get interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

731
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,630
what a and I and SC 11 are and might

732
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,000
actually get interested in something

733
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:54,230
awful like internet governance and soon

734
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're sitting up there on the dais</font>

735
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:59,650
video second point and this will be

736
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:03,910
briefer Steve asked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> term limits</font>

737
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:07,760
term limits<font color="#CCCCCC"> are crucial for two reasons</font>

738
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:09,589
one these elections and bodies like this

739
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,380
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunate effect of being</font>

740
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:14,210
popularity contests and to<font color="#CCCCCC"> protect the</font>

741
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:17,270
membership from those who are popular

742
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:23,410
but are incompetent it's very important

743
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:25,250
that these terms are limited secondly

744
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:27,920
journalists are important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those who</font>

745
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,569
are elected Michael sitting up there

746
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,460
Michael will sit up there for the rest

747
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:33,900
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his life if he thinks it's important</font>

748
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,910
to help the community because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he cares</font>

749
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,010
michael has done when he's done his time

750
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,810
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down so that</font>

751
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:44,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">he can enjoy it and not have to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

752
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:48,600
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and work every year thank you</font>

753
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:50,970
David so David let me just address a

754
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:56,940
more of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question to you than anything</font>

755
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:58,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">else so one of the challenges that we</font>

756
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:03,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">have when you think about the tutorials</font>

757
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:05,010
you know I I find a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of value in the</font>

758
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,560
introduction of EGP right I mean that is

759
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:10,050
you're exactly right that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

760
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,060
way to bring in fresh blood is to give

761
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,560
them give some<font color="#E5E5E5"> gene your engineer</font>

762
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:16,340
something to show their boss that says

763
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:19,380
this is going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help me help you right</font>

764
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:21,120
the challenge we have with those is that

765
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,460
the people who present those<font color="#E5E5E5"> ebb and</font>

766
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:26,370
flow because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not paying them to</font>

767
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,470
present it like some conferences do some

768
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:30,000
of Steve's proposal addresses that but

769
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:32,370
at the same time that's actually

770
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,200
separate from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> program and so it's</font>

771
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:37,799
not necessarily going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix exactly</font>

772
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:40,109
what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about so how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

773
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,030
how do we get people to stand up and say

774
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:43,470
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't care whether I have one person</font>

775
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,780
in the room listening to me or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred</font>

776
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:48,959
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to get up and talk</font>

777
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:50,310
about introduction of EGP the mpls<font color="#CCCCCC"> OEM</font>

778
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,190
tutorial<font color="#E5E5E5"> this morning had I think ten</font>

779
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:56,790
people in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> Philip Smith hasn't had to</font>

780
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:58,020
float either if I and<font color="#E5E5E5"> either a bunch of</font>

781
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,820
core people have been giving these

782
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:04,850
tutorials around the world for

783
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:07,620
20-something years Randy but<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanami then</font>

784
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:11,490
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of moved away from them by choice</font>

785
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:15,529
no blame don't if you move back I bet

786
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:17,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">you Philip comes back uh you know we</font>

787
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:19,710
can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak directly to that other</font>

788
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,960
side to say that if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

789
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,640
submitted that for this meeting and or

790
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,860
the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who we generally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask to</font>

791
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">present them had offered that up we</font>

792
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,420
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have put it on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the agenda</font>

793
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,420
absolutely

794
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:42,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay will note that maybe we can write</font>

795
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:45,710
it in the call for proposal sure Mike

796
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:52,660
Michael Sinatra yes net as the person

797
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:54,770
who recruited the 100 gig for a ni I I

798
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,180
have to respond with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all due respect</font>

799
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:58,460
David I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going to like it</font>

800
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:00,049
and i think it was given it another

801
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:03,230
conference it was the highest overall

802
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:05,120
rated talk in the survey maybe we

803
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:06,590
shouldn't have put acronyms in<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just</font>

804
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,600
called it real world hundred gig

805
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:10,280
deployment experiences and that would

806
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,380
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been so much you're right you're</font>

807
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,180
right so so Michaels point Michael is

808
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,010
exactly right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually I think I</font>

809
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,540
voted it so we vote one out of five<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

810
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:19,100
I voted a five it's actually the best

811
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,860
hundred cake presentation we have seen

812
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:24,259
in this warm period you're right the

813
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:26,030
title is horrible for<font color="#CCCCCC"> four hey you</font>

814
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:28,490
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it do not be dissing Greg</font>

815
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,870
like that happy what maybe that maybe

816
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:31,040
that is something that the program

817
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,900
condition think more active role in is

818
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,759
is getting the titles right so that it

819
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,170
actively conveys within the dog so the

820
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,240
agenda looks good for people that's

821
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:40,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">crazy talk that's a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good suggestion</font>

822
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,759
Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bush RJ have a suggestion for the</font>

823
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:48,529
time the last hundred gig talk you'll

824
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:52,760
ever have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do yes yeah I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

825
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:56,060
can probably remove from a lot of

826
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:59,840
acronyms that be good Johnny<font color="#CCCCCC"> TF Soviet</font>

827

WTF um some current president CEO<font color="#CCCCCC"> Varun</font>

828
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:08,170
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a point that</font>

829
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:11,830
Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bush made yeah actually I'm so um</font>

830
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:15,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> likely no to the Nano community</font>

831
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:17,600

836
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,549
I ask that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give them thanks the</font>

837
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:38,029
point that might have gone very quickly

838
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:39,759
by in the slides is nanog is financially

839

854
00:41:14,589 --> 00:41:21,639
something that will last for many years

855
00:41:18,149 --> 00:41:25,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">but we can always improve and in just a</font>

856
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:30,159
follow-up note to that everyone who's a

857
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:32,618
member has access via arrow which is the

858
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:35,589
service that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to register through</font>

859
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:37,509
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you register or login you have</font>

860
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:41,169
access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the men are financial data</font>

861
00:41:37,509 --> 00:41:42,939
so as soon as we get it and Mike who's

862
00:41:41,169 --> 00:41:45,519
the treasure and I review to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font>

863
00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:47,078
it's accurate we post for you so even

864
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,839
though we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sending you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> messages</font>

our profit and loss statements<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

866
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,630
quarterly financials and as soon as we

867
00:41:52,029 --> 00:41:57,459
get an official copy of our audit report

868
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:00,309
back we'll post all that information for

869
00:41:57,459 --> 00:42:03,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">you as well so there's this much</font>

870
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:05,469
transparency as we can possibly give you

871
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:12,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">by your membership in providing you</font>

872
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:14,709
information yes I German Daniels with

873
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:16,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet systems of social i consider</font>

874
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:19,388
myself perpetually new as an

875
00:42:16,929 --> 00:42:21,339
administrator as an operator I've been

876
00:42:19,389 --> 00:42:25,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five ten years depending on</font>

877
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:27,038
who glass and the large scope Internet

878
00:42:25,299 --> 00:42:29,769
Governance topics I think are very

879
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:32,529
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> for junior operators and I'm</font>

880
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:34,419
actually excited to go to that talk but

881
00:42:32,529 --> 00:42:36,159
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really like small</font>

882
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:37,929
details because a lot of us learn a lot

883
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:40,089
of us younger folks have learned just by

884
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:41,559
hacking things together and you know

885
00:42:40,089 --> 00:42:45,449
experimenting in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> garage and things</font>

886
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:47,859
like that and we're missing some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

887
00:42:45,449 --> 00:42:49,630
scientific you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the stuff you would</font>

888
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:51,189
pick up actually going to university and

889
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,980
things like that and so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

890
00:42:51,189 --> 00:42:52,970
confused

891
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,770
you think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of us went to</font>

892
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:59,299
university for this well<font color="#E5E5E5"> not not you</font>

893
00:42:54,770 --> 00:43:03,350
guys necessarily but so I think that

894
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:05,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">both the macrocosm and microcosm aspects</font>

895
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:08,380
of being an operator should be addressed

896
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:10,340
in future tutorials that in future

897
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:12,140
education tracks and things like that

898
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:15,920
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that a thousand dollars</font>

899
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:17,868
is a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ridiculous for like b-sides</font>

900
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,520
for instance there's zero dollars and

901
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:23,840
you know they have three days of great

902
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:26,090
classes so figuring out figuring that

903
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,440
out you know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be your</font>

904
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:30,140
guys's job and that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we liked you</font>

905
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:35,119
but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a thousand dollars is</font>

906
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:38,990
just way too much to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

907
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,970
sorry just a follow-on are you would you

908
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:44,868
like to have like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sort of a back to</font>

909
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:47,779
the basics trainings or fill the gaps in

910
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:49,880
my education Nora yeah it's something

911
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,080
like that i mean like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

912
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard you know because all of us</font>

913
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:56,210
are at different levels and<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

914
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:58,850
education you know what we do day to day

915
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:00,560
may not reflect at all on the actual

916
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:02,359
science behind it all but it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

917
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,910
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting to know about Alice</font>

918
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:05,990
electrons flow but a lot of people

919
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:10,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably aren't interested at all in</font>

920
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:13,310
that so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know exactly what that</font>

921
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:17,960
tipping point is between being you know

922
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:19,250
pedantic and and interesting but yes I

923
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,680
would definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to have like the</font>

924
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:23,420
back to the basics as well as the you

925
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:30,529
know really advanced you know large

926
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:35,570
installations type stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thanks Randy</font>

00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:38,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">bush I changes coming on um Betty I must</font>

928
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:40,640
be wrong but the access to the financial

929
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:43,190
reports is not members only correct

930
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,990
please thank you I just didn't

931
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:47,600
understand my side she said her yeah I

932
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:51,859
heard I heard her Patrick it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok yep</font>

933
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:53,690
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter to speak for her it's</font>

934
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:55,049
not for you Randy it's the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

935
00:44:53,690 --> 00:45:01,710
people in the room

we are number two is as an internet

Technical Community ITF fills the

00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:26,640
protocol community the registries fill

941
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:30,930
the registry and we wish not the really

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:36,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the regulatory community and I SOG</font>

is really our community agent for<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy</font>

944
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:44,810
and I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the phrase</font>

00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:49,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed so popular but internet</font>

947
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:57,240
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to invite them in on that</font>

948
00:45:54,930 --> 00:46:00,899
segment and they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done some really</font>

949
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:04,470
excellent work I thought really<font color="#E5E5E5"> turned</font>

950
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:07,230
around in recent years and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance</font>

they've got five<font color="#E5E5E5"> strength this is going</font>

be the futures of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet one of</font>

955
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:19,470
them is if the device manufacturers if

00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:21,900
these people control the internet you

know your<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone another is if what if</font>

958
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:30,180
the telcos control the internet etc and

959
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:34,170
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a lot of work in this area</font>

960
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:36,660
and they're really taken over in the ITF

961
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:39,210
and and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth community</font>

965
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:52,410
that stuff would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting not not</font>

to denigrate at<font color="#CCCCCC"> aarons um great and</font>

do you have more questions or

973
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:23,830
interventions it's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

974
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:37,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">or enquiry google so getting back to the</font>

membership renewal stuff can there be a

00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:41,569
way we can have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it automatically renew I</font>

977
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:43,609
mean I got through your notice and I

978
00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:46,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">ignored it for 29 days because I was</font>

979
00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:47,630
annoying to go find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a credit card having</font>

980
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:51,859
an automatically renew would be awesome

981
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:58,190
I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> that idea but you can sign up for</font>

982
00:47:51,859 --> 00:48:02,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 years and you get a small discount we</font>

983
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:05,619
can check what we can do or in if I

984
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:09,049
think there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some limits to in</font>

985
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:10,940
because of the payment<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we can't just</font>

986
00:48:09,049 --> 00:48:16,009
go withdraw money from your account that

987
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:17,569
will but let us see<font color="#E5E5E5"> let us see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font>

988
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:24,020
can do to make it probably a little more
