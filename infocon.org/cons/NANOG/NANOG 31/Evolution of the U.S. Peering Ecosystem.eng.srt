<font color="#E5E5E5">questions that as a content provider I</font>

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,468
to peer does it make more sense for us

00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:48,420
to just keep buying transit what's the

18
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,489
climate like would anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> appear with</font>

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:56,309
can answer some of these questions after

document internet operations where no

pic to the news

36
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,480
the reason i<font color="#E5E5E5"> put these slides together</font>

37
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,550
actually there were three reasons the

38
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,369
first is as many of you Star Trek fans

39
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">know Starfleet Academy is based here in</font>

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,400
think search for<font color="#E5E5E5"> spock maybe the second</font>

42
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:33,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you had a late</font>

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:39,090
night last night in the holodeck had

44
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:44,020
many garlic dishes much Romulan ale and

45
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:46,300
afterwards some gawk but really to point

46
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,459
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the peering community about</font>

47
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">fifteen percent of you folks i classify</font>

48
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,910
as being in the peering community<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went</font>

49
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,670
through and check names of folks who I

50
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:57,489
work with on more or<font color="#CCCCCC"> less a daily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weekly</font>

51
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,859
basis and the peering community is

52
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:01,570
really kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> close-knit community a</font>

53
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,430
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these folks know each other they</font>

54
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,930
work in different companies but they

55
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,790
work very closely with each other and

56
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,200
it's when things break in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

57
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the night that you really need to know</font>

00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,410
things fixed so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> five-year mission has</font>

61
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,170
actually been to work very closely with

62
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,340
appearing coordinator community I

63
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,929
describe myself as being an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

64
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,540
researcher because i'm ninety percent

65
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,190
externally focused working very closely

66
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,130
with appearing coordinators<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find out</font>

67
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:32,709
what are the peering practices what are

68
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,660
the definitions and what I do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I write</font>

69
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:39,310
these research documents these white

70
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:41,109
papers on peering that basically go

71
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">through this process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll find an</font>

72
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,790
interesting operations topic by talking

73
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:48,579
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ren or Joe or or broke are one of</font>

the guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is of interest of hearing</font>

75
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,450
coordinators and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask them how does</font>

76
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff work what are the definitions</font>

77
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,200
and I'll write down<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they say and</font>

78
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,420
walk peering coordinators through the

79
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,220
results of that first white paper and

80
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,450
people will<font color="#E5E5E5"> change things as they know</font>

81
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,060
it doesn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that you have to</font>

82
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:06,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">modify this and I'll evolve this paper</font>

83
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,040
and eventually as I'll do today share

84
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,350
the information with a broader

85
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,690
conference type of environment so far

86
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,010
there are about eight pairing papers

87
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,779
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> publicly available these are</font>

all freely available you can send email

00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:20,619
to me if you like or you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find them</font>

90
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,479
if you search for<font color="#E5E5E5"> William B</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Norton on</font>

91
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,490

94
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:30,970
today it's called the evolution of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">u.s. peering ecosystem and for this</font>

96
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,920
white paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> I asked the question how has</font>

97
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:42,100
peering changed since the telecom crash

98
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:43,750
around 2000 2001 secondarily I started

99
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,760
getting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of our potential</font>

100
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,620
customers from overseas coming in and

101
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,539
saying hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill I'd love to come into</font>

102

104
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,430

105
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not exactly how it works so this</font>

106
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,020
paper also doubles to describe how it

107
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,820
actually does work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I'm really</font>

108
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,490
shooting here for is to identify the

109
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,990
players the motivations that can help us

110
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,780
predict the behaviors of the various

111
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,700
players in the peering ecosystem so let

112
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">me start out with a couple of basic</font>

113
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,260
definitions the first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course is the</font>

114
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,180
internet as a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> of networks and I</font>

115
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,920
tend to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these networks of</font>

116
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,650
networks as being broken down into this

117
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,620
global peering ecosystem that consists

118
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,390
of individual internet regions and when

119
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,300
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> say internet region today you can just</font>

120
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,770
think of country just substitute country

121
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:35,830
wherever I say internet region and you

122
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,380
about have it within each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

123
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:42,070
internet regions what we tend to see our

124
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:44,620
three rough classifications of providers

125
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,050
of players each with their own position

126
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,570
in the ecosystem each with their own

127
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,980
motivations and again these motivations

128
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,810
are important because they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us</font>

129
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,940
predict the behavior in the peering

130
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:58,120
ecosystem and these three rough

131
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:01,210
categories are tier 1 ISPs tier two isps

132
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,630
and content players and<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you guys</font>

133
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:07,270
get the arrows out and start shooting me

134
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:10,240
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a very strong point here</font>

135
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:13,299
that I am reclaiming the phrase tier<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

136
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">isp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a very specific definition and</font>

137
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,020
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to describe each of these</font>

138
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:19,540
players<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of an organism again</font>

139
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,760
the Star Trek theme here so we're kind

140
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,490
of viewing these things from afar what

141
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:29,140
does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> look like from the outside so we</font>

142
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:31,060
have 21 ISPs that by definition our ISPs

143
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,280
have access to the entire internet

144
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,830
region solely through peering

145
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,760
relationships that is they do not buy

146
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:41,359
transit from anybody to

147
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,730
reach routes destinations within that

148
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,300
particular internet region so I draw

149
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:49,190
these tier 1 ISPs as having downstream

150
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,870
links these are transit connections what

151
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,780
they sell to their customers and then

152
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,610
peering links off to the side there so

153
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">because these guys don't buy transit</font>

154
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,650
from anybody they have a motivation in

155
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,870
the peering ecosystem that hey we have

156
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:07,159
all the peering that we need we don't

157
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:09,560
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> any more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Pierce and that for that</font>

158
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason we see and in the paper I go into</font>

159
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">this a little bit more there's a peering</font>

160
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,740
inclination that I would describe as

161
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:18,380
restrictive a restrictive peering policy

162
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,990
restrictive inclination basically is we

163
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to appear with anybody else</font>

164
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:25,580
it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit controversial but in a</font>

165
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,260
nutshell that's what it tends to be also

166
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,510
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the u.s. what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 8</font>

00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:41,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">right-hand corner interesting in this</font>

171
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,620
ecosystem you do tend to see roughly and

172
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:46,130
full measure appearing in each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

173
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,900
those interconnect regions so who these

174
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:51,380
two true ISPs well again by my

175
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,960
definitions everybody else is a tier 2

176
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,460
is P so if you have to buy transit and

177
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,159
you are a tier 2 is be by my definition

178
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,989
and again why are these definitions

179
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,030
important why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> these classifications</font>

180
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,400
important the reason is that it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

181
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,159
the motivations and the behaviors as

182
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,169
seen from the outside of these players

183
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,240
the up streams are shown as lions going

184
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,700
up to the top typically up to a tier 1

185
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,670
ISP or perhaps another tier 2 is<font color="#E5E5E5"> P and</font>

186
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,440
the motivation here is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer for two</font>

187
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:21,880
reasons basically from what I've seen in

188
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,260
the research first is to reduce costs

189
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,630
traffic you send across free peering

190
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,760
infrastructure is<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost is traffic you</font>

191
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:32,270
don't have to pay for up to your transit

192
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:34,729
providers upstream and inclination tends

193
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,439
to reflect that also with the tier two

194
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,990
isps<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll see a range of hearing</font>

195
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,790
inclinations from being open also known

196
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,710
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> brooke all I think calls it pulse</font>

197
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,949
peering will appear with you if you have

198
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,990
a pulse to selectively where there might

199
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:50,240
be some prerequisites that are

200
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">ultimately reachable five megabits per</font>

201
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,180
second on each<font color="#E5E5E5"> cup</font>

202
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,860
for example and then we will appear with

203
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,420
you and I say sparse appearing because

204
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:01,820
what you see a lot of is the tier two

205
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,920
isps tend to be in one or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

206
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,900
interconnect regions few of them tend to

207
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,640
be in many of them so in terms of the

208
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">interconnection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't tend to see a</font>

209
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,160
full mesh and plus the Selective notion

210
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,709
makes it so that some people do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

211
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,810
appear with each other and then finally

00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:20,360
the third character in the third

213
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:22,640

only with the upstream connections again

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,290
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about 1998 here so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

the beginning we're going to talk about

218
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:36,079
evolution so this is where we started in

219
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,410
1998 and the content providers typically

220
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,690
did not appear at all they held hold on

221
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,850
to that SLA from the upstream and the

222
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:48,650
primary<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus was really creating and</font>

223
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:53,330
delivering the content so this was the

00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:56,540
pre-crash around 1998 as groups of these

per second of upstream transit and forty

294
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,339
percent of that ultimately

295
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,319
is or could be destined<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the other</font>

296
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,990
peers the other cable companies the

297
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,849
other tier two isps now when I wrote the

298
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:06,180
white paper called<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter connection</font>

299
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,500
strategies for ISPs and internet service

300
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,810
providers and peering there was a

301
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,790
break-even point typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> where peering</font>

302
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:14,189
made sense around<font color="#E5E5E5"> five to ten megabits</font>

303
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:17,490
per second and these guys could peer

304
00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:20,069
forty percent of let's say five gigabits

305
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">per second that's two gigabits per</font>

306
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:24,389
second that they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have to pay</font>

307
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:27,839
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they could send directly to the</font>

308
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:29,189
other cable companies this is huge so

309
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,569
what we see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cable companies though</font>

310
00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:32,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">is they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't tend to go after the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">commercial market and sell transit so</font>

312
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,680
that's why you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the trans lanes</font>

313
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:39,149
down beneath this particular critter<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

315
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:43,620
what I've seen is to save money to

316
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:47,099
reduce that load but also to improve the

317
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,709
performance for the customers in terms

318
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,449
of inclination the peering inclination

319
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:54,180
largely for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge amount of traffic</font>

320
00:13:51,449 --> 00:13:57,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">was open although it shifted a little</font>

321
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,309
bit recently and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of the peering</font>

322
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:01,470
it does tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sparse depending on</font>

323
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:04,709
what regions the cable companies cover

324
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:06,029
in terms of their home markets and just

325
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:09,508
to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you some numbers some ideas of</font>

326
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">how huge this is around 2002 and I did</font>

327
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:12,870
this research and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the numbers are much</font>

328
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,689
bigger now I'm told but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

329
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:18,769
about 12 million eyeballs I guess 24

330
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,769
million if you count them both

331
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,250
and the other notable thing about the

332
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,350
cable companies is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was an</font>

333
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,720
800-pound gorilla among the group and

334
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was AOL where you've seen three to</font>

335
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">five gigabits per second roughly with</font>

336
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,899
the most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable companies AOL was</font>

337
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,300
way-off-the-charts at the time maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12</font>

338
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:41,529
gigabits per second<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic and again</font>

339
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,649
I understand the numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are much higher</font>

340
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:49,269
but it is notable that there is one<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

341
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:51,130
very large group there so again the

342
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:53,350
first evolution in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ecosystem as a</font>

343
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,970
result of those five<font color="#E5E5E5"> disruptions is that</font>

344
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,759
the cable companies get into peering in

345
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,889
a very very big way this is significant

346
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">because the traffic volume and because</font>

347
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:02,920
at the time the cable companies were

348
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:07,089
openly pairing with anybody and

349
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:09,099
everybody and again the keziah fact was

350
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:10,990
noted to me by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eric Troyer we he said</font>

351
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,690
you know once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you set up peering between</font>

352
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,160
two companies you expect a certain

353
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,810
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic to go between those</font>

354
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,060
two companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> based upon your analysis</font>

355
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,459
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it consistently seems to be fifteen</font>

356
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:24,069
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty-five percent higher and the</font>

357
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:26,050
theory was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that more traffic is</font>

358
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:28,899
preferring the path across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pairing</font>

359
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">connection because it's lower latency so</font>

360
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:32,920
in the old<font color="#E5E5E5"> world where it go up a</font>

361
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,600
transit pipe and then back down you'd

362
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,510
have a worse performing pathing because

363
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would prefer now the peering path so</font>

364
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:43,149
you get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic across</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your pairing</font>

365
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:46,349
length than before the second evolution

366
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:49,959
has to do with some very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large scale</font>

367
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network savvy content providers and to</font>

368
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:52,779
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some names these are the</font>

369
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,639
Microsoft's and the yahoos of the world

370
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:57,399
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google's the Electronic Arts and</font>

371
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,410
folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that that have decided that</font>

372
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can build out some peering</font>

373
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,000
infrastructure and get better

374
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:06,599
performance and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce their costs</font>

375
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,220
I think round numbers I heard at

376
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,410
conference in Singapore the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo is</font>

377
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:15,750
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a blended transit and</font>

378
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:18,130
peering cost down into the single digits

379
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:21,009
there's a mega bits per second dollars

380
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,990
per megabit per second so what was

381
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:24,759
interesting about these guys is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

382
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,769
wasn't so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> the financial motivation</font>

383
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,740
as it was to improve the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-user</font>

384
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:31,569
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting that screen up fast</font>

385
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,490
seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the primary driving</font>

386
00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:36,270
motivation although the cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> savings was</font>

387
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:38,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">also in there as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and universally</font>

388
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,600
content providers seem to have an open

389
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:43,899
pairing policy so basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> poults</font>

390
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,060
appearing model I described earlier so

391
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:48,250
here's the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> graphic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> showing these</font>

392
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,649
guys evolving from just being content

393
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:53,649
providers buying transit up into peering

394
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:55,899
with the tier two isps and again this is

395
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:58,089
a significant evolution because the

396
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:59,320
volume<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic is huge here with</font>

397
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:01,330
these companies we're talking in the

398
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,070
tens of gigabits<font color="#E5E5E5"> per second of traffic</font>

399
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:06,280
that used to solely go up to the tier 1

400
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:08,230
ISPs before coming down to the tier two

401
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,089
isps or the other eyeball companies and

402
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,730
now it's being sent directly to the tier

403
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,589
two isps it's also significant because

404
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,500
the content providers have an open

405
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:19,329
pairing policy and again interesting the

406
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,160
motivation is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost</font>

407
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,849
savings<font color="#E5E5E5"> but to improve the end user</font>

408
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:27,100
performance and what I see is these few

409
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:28,600
players these leading players are

410
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:30,699
leading the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the other folks that</font>

411
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,530
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting into it one of the other</font>

412
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,540
reasons that I heard for getting into

413
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:37,420
peering was we needed to move out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

414
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:40,690
bankrupt Colo anyway so why not go into

415
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,920
an exchange point somewhere and then the

416
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">third evolution is kind of an actual</font>

417
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:47,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">fall out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first two which is that</font>

418
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:49,990
the cable companies period openly with

419
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:52,059
these large-scale content guys and this

420
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an interesting proposition in the</font>

421
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:57,850
pairing ecosystem you can get your

422
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,860
content literally right on the network

423
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:02,230
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable companies in terms of</font>

424
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:05,260
performance I mean boom it's right there

425
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,340
and this is a significant change because

426
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,960
again if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all this</font>

427
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic they used to go through the tier</font>

428
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:13,030
1 ISPs those pipes are shrinking quite a

429
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,240
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wouldn't bring it up except</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to is</font>

430
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:23,110
10 gigabits per second for each of these

431
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:25,570
guys this is where the last summary

432
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,100
slide that kind of shows one other

433
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:32,678
aspect of the change and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has to do</font>

434
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:36,040
with the peering inclinations what we

435
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,300
saw early on is the large content guys

436
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't join appearing and they kind of</font>

437
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,800
migrated into an open pairing policy

438
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,500
preparing inclination the chair<font color="#CCCCCC"> to guys</font>

439
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,158
also started out with not a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

440
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">hearing</font>

441
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:49,090
and have migrated into an open pairing

442
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:52,029
policy but most dramatically is once

443
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:54,939
excited home disappeared and forced the

444
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:56,739
cable companies into buying transit from

445
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,249
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tier ones they too started out with</font>

446
00:18:56,739 --> 00:19:02,470
no peering as a policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and migrated into</font>

447
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:04,419
the open pairing policy appearing with

448
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,159
just about anybody more recently we're

449
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:08,049
starting to see some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the companies</font>

450
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:09,940
requiring you know five or 10 gigabits

451
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:12,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">per fiber 10 megabits per second on two</font>

452
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:15,099
coasts so these guys are kind of inching

453
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:18,450
into the selective hearing of policies

454
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:20,918
the our box are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know around</font>

455
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,739
because like<font color="#E5E5E5"> bellsouth have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taken</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

456
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:26,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">little while to get into the peering</font>

457
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:28,119
ecosystem but they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a now</font>

458
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:31,749
and they tend to be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

459
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:33,070
selective side tier 1 ISPs have always

460
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:35,259
been on the restrictive side again

461
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,570
restrictive we really don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore</font>

462
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:39,419
peering but we are seeing them shift<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

463
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:42,249
little bit more towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> a selective side</font>

464
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:44,470
mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of the hammer of the</font>

465
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:46,929
Department of Justice over their head

466
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:48,970
making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're applying their</font>

467
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:51,849
policies uniformly to everyone who comes

468
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:53,409
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> asks and then the foreign ISPs this</font>

469
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:56,619
was again part of the motivation for

470
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:57,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">writing this dissuade paper a lot of</font>

471
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:00,639
times that these guys would come over

472
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">from another country and say hey we're</font>

473
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,719
the largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP in the world we should</font>

474
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:08,080
be able to get peering with all the tier

475
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,809
1 ISPs and they go<font color="#CCCCCC"> after it and they</font>

476
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,309
have largely been unsuccessful<font color="#CCCCCC"> so then</font>

477
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:15,309
they shift gears and they go towards a

478
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:17,799
selective hearing policy and they go and

479
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:20,168
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> having conversations about selling</font>

480
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:25,649
transit to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks in the peering</font>

481
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:25,649
community and that largely fails as well

482
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,570
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally we see them shifting</font>

483
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:33,340
into the open pairing policy where we

484
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,989
see a large number of folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming in</font>

485
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,029
from Europe and in Asia which have

486
00:20:34,989 --> 00:20:38,919
generally speaking a more open pairing

487
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:42,429
policy so they'll appear with just about

488
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:46,869
anybody these are very rough categories

489
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:49,619
by the way and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I have time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

490
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:49,619
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions</font>

491
00:20:50,140 --> 00:21:01,390
oh hi I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kathy wit wrote used to once</font>

492
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:04,000
upon a time work it at home that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you</font>

493
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:05,740
put the last slide back up<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

494
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,500
there's a couple things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

495
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:11,770
doesn't capture there was excited it was

496
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:14,290
at home and at home had an open here in

497
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:17,650
policy and so I don't know where the no

498
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:20,230
peering comes from the difference went

499
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:22,240
out home went away is that instead of at

500
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,880
home having an open hearing policy for

501
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,250
25 cable providers all of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden the</font>

502
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,920
25 cable providers went out and got

503
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:32,080
carrying on their own but and I don't

504
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,060
know what excited because I don't have

505
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">any idea but we appeared with everybody</font>

506
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:42,429
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the data point I got was</font>

507
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,899
from a couple content guys but it is

508
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,640
joining a couple data points the<font color="#CCCCCC"> excite</font>

509
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:50,280
side and the at home side were really

510
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,280
different and the merger was a challenge

511
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kathy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing I found interesting too</font>

512
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,590
is every time I talk to an excited home

513
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,840
person they always want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to separate</font>

514
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:06,939
excited way from at home I never quite

515
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:08,139
understood that well the problem was you

516
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,840
know when you buy a company either

517
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,600
merger you don't and when at home body

518
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:16,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">sight we didn't merge so it was still</font>

519
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,980
two separate companies functioning

520
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,920
separately for all intents and purposes

521
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:24,340
for a really long time so there were

522
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:30,400
completely different policies<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank</font>

523
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:38,790
you in the back of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the corner</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">same name again Peter Peter Cohen from</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">TeliaSonera I was wondering bill if</font>

526
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,740
you've seen sort of a the edge being

527
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:51,070
pushed out from hearing for new market

528
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:54,640
for the business side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

529
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:56,830
relationship such that the edge<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now</font>

530
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,040
farther out because so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> peering is</font>

531
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:02,649
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> eating up the transit business</font>

532
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:06,399
for customers or four networks rather

533
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:09,640
such that networks are better routing

534
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,680
but they've lost business on the other

535
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:16,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the underlying</font>

536
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:18,280
period I'm sorry I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure I followed</font>

537
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:21,780
the question Peter yeah that was kind of

538
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:25,240
confusing how I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it</font>

539
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:28,330
has all the peering resulted in a loss

540
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,120
of revenue not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

541
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:33,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">following</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prices of dollars of transit</font>

542
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,689
but also because of the peering

543
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:40,360
relationships that have all come

544
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:41,380
underneath all the other providers yeah

545
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,790
you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an interesting</font>

546
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:48,310
point the transit prices have dropped

547
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:51,460
pretty dramatically just taking a survey

548
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:53,020
last night I asked folks you know rough

549
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,830
numbers how much are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are you paying</font>

550
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:58,990
for transit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> geez we're talking in</font>

551
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:02,050
the the ten twenty thirty dollars per

552
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:04,750
meg now some folks won't you know it

553
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:06,430
admit those prices but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty</font>

554
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,170
substantial and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of folks are</font>

555
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:10,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saying just peering</font>

556
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:12,940
really make sense anymore if I can buy

557
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:15,310
transit on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the order of twenty or thirty</font>

558
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:18,250
dollars a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Meg</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you look at the</font>

559
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:20,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">math the question you know it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

560
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly clear there's a break-even point</font>

561
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,730
you can do the math<font color="#CCCCCC"> and figure the cost</font>

562
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,070
appearing across the number of megabits

563
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:30,160
per second that you send against a flat

564
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,780
line of the transit price and you see

565
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,880
there's a break point where it used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

566
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:36,430
be maybe five<font color="#CCCCCC"> or ten megabits per second</font>

567
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,960
Peter now it's maybe closer to 50 or 60

568
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:40,330
megabytes per second and if you're

569
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,550
buying a fast e with that infrastructure

570
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:46,379
there's not a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of growth space</font>

571
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:49,960
so it really does come down to a

572
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:52,630
trade-off question is it a financial

573
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,000
motivation or do you appear because the

574
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:56,890
performance is what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going after</font>

575
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,480
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> thus we're seeing a lot more of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

576
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:01,330
the gaming companies getting into

577
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,770
pairing in a very big way I don't know

578
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:04,090
if I answered your question or talked

579
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:06,389
long enough so you don't care the answer

580
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,389

00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,390
kind of slowly coming in there you see

companies like AOL that are doing you

595
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:05,309
know paid pairing but the price point is

596

you know above<font color="#E5E5E5"> that which people can get</font>

people going towards that model again

for the performance reasons they want to

604

about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of peering actually</font>

612

another twist on that could the amount

in New Zealand where there's a

in order to get to New Zealand or to

646

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a cost associated with that</font>

00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:24,909
coffee time so cut the questions off

00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:01,389
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was one of the sticking</font>

so I can I can I respond to that which

683
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:40,120
is that I've said that we offer an

<font color="#E5E5E5">just using it for peering the SLA is</font>

689
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,690
much less<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a concern to them I guess</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">my last question is</font>

691

748
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:11,899
it's a fascinating point maybe i can i

749
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,519
can paraphrase it for the audience when

750
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:16,250
i was working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the follow-up to this</font>

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,289
white paper the asia-pacific pairing

752
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,419
ecosystem what i tried to do is identify

753
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:23,090
what was different or counterintuitive

754
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:24,820
for those folks who expanded into<font color="#E5E5E5"> asia I</font>

755
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:27,259
know you were talking about Europe but

756
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:30,139
stay with me here as he expanded into

757
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:33,019
Asia one of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found was</font>

758
00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:35,479
what I call the tier 1 peering dynamic

759
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:37,669
the foreign<font color="#E5E5E5"> tier one pairing dynamic and</font>

760
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,100
this happens when a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company let's say</font>

761
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:43,519
like you you net expands into Japan and

762
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:45,350
they say to the Japanese<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs hey tier 1</font>

763
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,809
guys here we're the biggest network in

764
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:50,928
the world where your units where global

765
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:53,418
were huge and they are and the cheer

766
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:55,279
ones in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Japan say I'm sorry I don't want</font>

767
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:57,139
to be with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you here but I no problem</font>

768
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,110
peering with you on the other you know

769
00:32:57,139 --> 00:33:01,639
in the US and you net says no I don't

770
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,820
appear with you in the in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US so the</font>

771
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:06,949
ultimately<font color="#CCCCCC"> did not appear it was</font>

772
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:09,168
fascinating<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you net then becomes</font>

773
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:11,779
a tier 2 and that ecosystem and likewise

774
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:13,909
NTT or a better example might be Japan

775
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:17,509
telecom comes into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US and becomes</font>

776
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:19,250
tier<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 in our ecosystem and there are</font>

777
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:21,559
motivations and behaviors that we were

778
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:24,259
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify as to why this happens</font>

779
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:26,418
it turns out that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tier one isp is</font>

780
00:33:24,259 --> 00:33:29,210
desire to protect their home market is

781
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:31,460
far greater than any peering benefits

782
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:33,619
can deliver both financially and

783
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,830
performance wise protecting the whole

784
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:38,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">market is a much stronger motivation</font>

785
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:40,199
again it was kind of fascinating to me

786
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:42,450
because I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just looking at Asia</font>

787
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,860
and this is universal actually talking

788
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:46,529
to folks in Europe talking to folks in

789
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:48,809
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. yeah absolutely tr1 ISPs in any</font>

790
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:51,120
particular marketer they loathed appear

791
00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:53,000
with anybody else even coming in from

792
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,879
another country where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were tier 1</font>

793
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,889
just what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was taping West I I know for</font>

794
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,889
a fact that we had us-based tier 1

795
00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:03,479
riders who want to be with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in yeah in</font>

796
00:34:01,889 --> 00:34:04,979
Europe we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> deep here with them but</font>

797
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,539
that meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also want to get us</font>

798
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,460
traffic and had them paper here to

799
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:10,619
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the Atlantic and they</font>

800
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:14,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">were in too keen on doing that yeah it</font>

801
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:15,690
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting discussion yeah again</font>

802
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:17,118
that was the reason I wrote the white

803
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,109
papers to try and identify those

804
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,290
motivations and behaviors to kind of

805
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:23,790
explain what we see you can take the

806
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,440
last time question yeah last one real

807
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:28,918
quick and then it's at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Opry time hey</font>

808
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,159
Tom a question about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US specifically</font>

809
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:33,690
in ecology here so there's lots of

810
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:36,929
policies user foot some of which may

811
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:39,510
result in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the our box re assuming full</font>

812
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:41,369

814

815
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,629
affect the period ecosystem here in the

816
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:50,460
US I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I understand the</font>

817
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:52,739
question but the our box and the cable

818
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,649
companies seem to be two different

819
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:59,029
groups that control the access in right

820
00:34:55,649 --> 00:35:01,970
but currently currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the</font>

821
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:04,020
nation because of layer nine factors

822
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:06,899
Thomas systems are able to interconnect

823
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:09,630
all the way down to end<font color="#CCCCCC"> users basically</font>

824
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:12,359
the our box are obliged to accommodate

825
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:14,790
that kind of service so you can run on a

826
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:17,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">commis network so basically the</font>

827
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:19,800
dresses can be a part of independent

service providers autonomous system

829
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,460
rather than being a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a the arbok</font>

830
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,080
owns the eyeballs and then there's a

831
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,650
clearing relationship that delivers that

832
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:30,480
traffic between the end network and the

833
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:35,300
say the service provider network which

834
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,590
is not localized some of the policy

835
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,040
issues that are that are in play right

836
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:42,840
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> could change it to that so in effect</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the read the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our box could become kind</font>
