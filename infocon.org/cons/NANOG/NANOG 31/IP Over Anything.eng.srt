00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:08,570
ok

00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:11,420
oh that's me

00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,010
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we begin all the</font>

00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:18,939
our ballot so those of you who have some

00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:22,009
religion on one technology or another

7
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:23,630
realized that you have to be I have to

00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:27,080
be pretty agnostic about it and just use

00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:29,570
what's out there everybody's got a

you got a CLI works a little better we

20
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,460
didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need all that extra gear</font>

in the core either but things are

22
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,059
different today frames still out there

23
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,060
still in use

24
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:26,679
still using it it's got some interesting

25
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,060
mechanisms we could still use of share

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,679
switches to switches tend to be a little

31
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:45,270
cheaper than the routers there's some

32
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:47,920
interesting potential for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Policy routing</font>

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,569
that we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't explored all of</font>

34
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,159
yet and you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do some</font>

link state prioritisation issues oh they

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,159
abound there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of problems or</font>

39
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:07,140
there were a lot of problems with the

frame network with links<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

41
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:13,230
prioritization issues what happened was

42
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,849
you didn't get sufficient priority on

43
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,119
link state so when someone go through

44
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:19,980
and start competing<font color="#CCCCCC"> their SPFs they had</font>

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,750
dropped links if they became too busy or

46
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,160
if there was congestion and a link truck

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">then another link dropped and then</font>

55
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:59,640
little bit we overcame some of those

56
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:02,549
limitations by massive parallelism about

57
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,010
eight parallel paths you could take to

58
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:09,600
the network in some cases that's still

59
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:11,548
out there actually so is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there a way we</font>

60
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,130
can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things a little better without</font>

61
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:16,079
having to go from one type of device to

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,840
another type of device<font color="#CCCCCC"> to determine the</font>

64
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,629
that there will be later

65
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,480
once again things are different some

66
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:28,480
people are have<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-speed OC 48 SAR I</font>

67
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:33,488
don't but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one interesting</font>

68
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,530
mechanism you could use one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fun</font>

69
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:38,430
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had with ATM for a while</font>

70
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:43,650
was a you BRB be our<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual profile</font>

71
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:47,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">network where we would have traffic at</font>

72
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:50,829
one time a day that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was mainly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you BR</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

73
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,799
get queued differently and we had

74
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:55,629
another profile of traffic that was vbr

75
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,440
that was obviously cute in a more

76
00:03:55,629 --> 00:04:01,899
preferential way it worked but it became

77
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,250
a headache again it's a lot of

78
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,030
complexity I think as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Randy was</font>

79
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:09,549
mentioning the complexity<font color="#E5E5E5"> can kill</font>

80
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,230
framed ATM mapping that helped add some

81
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,440
life to our switches managed to get

82
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:17,168
things scaled up a bit more of course

83
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,940
then you run into sub interface issues

84
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:22,000
how many subinterfaces can you manage

85
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:25,780
and collect stats on once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> links</font>

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,580
type of organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> in ATM we had</font>

87
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:31,780
issues again and the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

88
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:33,698
frame where if you provision one<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp on</font>

89
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,460
top of another<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the overlay</font>

90
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:40,449
model that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> unit has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been very fond</font>

91
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,979
of for so many years the thing about the

92
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:45,039
overlay model is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you earn one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

94
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,150
underneath congested and let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take ATM</font>

95
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you drop one sell out of every five</font>

96
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">or ten for congestion issues you're</font>

97
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,630
going to suddenly have flapping

98
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:01,360
we also had problems with the ATM

99
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,280
switches with link state priority where

100
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,850
you would get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a flood of traffic you</font>

101
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,039
would take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a link offline and that would</font>

102
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,770
cause churn the churn would get<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse</font>

103
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:17,460
more links to drop and I just get worse

104
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:21,760
and worse this is what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> today</font>

105
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:25,900
that's today not necessarily tomorrow as

106
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:29,110
you can see we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a full mesh planer</font>

107
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:33,310
full mesh of the adjacencies across the

108
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:35,890
transit core a metro basically those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

109
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,100
fiber rings but we provision LSPs to the

00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rings</font>

111
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:47,590
we use oh by the way there's ecmp of

112
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:49,540
course involved on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLS and so we get</font>

113
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,549
some load sharing their so actually this

114
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:55,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">could be parallel paths you could have</font>

120
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:15,730
reasons simplified troubleshooting it's

121
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,110
much easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to troubleshoot when you're</font>

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one device and it contains all the</font>

125
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:25,690
two different things we can manage the

126
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,270
flows directly on the routers this has

127
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:31,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">the direct benefit of allowing the igp</font>

128
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:34,690
to be queued differently since we're

129

fond of is is is is gets to be in its

130
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:40,180
nice separate cue from all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MPLS LSPs</font>

traffic still as I be forwarded as well

00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,290
in certain situations so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that got rid of</font>

134
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,380
the problems that you'd get with with

135
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,540
ATM somewhere in the middle of your

136
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,860
network dropping packets and having

<font color="#E5E5E5">trouble determining where that's</font>

00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,849
failure protection that that didn't

140
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,570
exist and allow the other platforms

141
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:06,670
where you get a faster route and it's a

142

means to an end you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

up with a situation where i can drop

154
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:47,490
people's traffic so I like to pretest

155
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:49,919
first and then build on a large scale

156

159
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,390
about once a week and only if they

160
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:04,410
varied by a certain percentage it's a

161
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:06,719
real easy way using mpls and IP combined

162
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,460
to determine what the latency is an

link specific preemption that's a pet

project of mine that I've been hitting

up the vendors for for a while

177
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:53,190
link specific preemption means taking a

specific link LSP combination and

179
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:59,070
providing priority over that specific

make those links less desirable in terms

00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:01,459
because you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want this cause at 3am</font>

but you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want enough that it makes</font>

201
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:03,979
it harder for you to fix the problem or

217
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,160
a satisfactory answer as to how much

218

redundancy do you want

219
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,889
and if I can ever get one it'll be

220
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,889
fantastic

<font color="#CCCCCC">igp it's good for a general indication</font>

222
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,620
of where you want the traffic to go it's

223
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,020
something that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep very</font>

224
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,390
stable because it's how I make decisions

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,930
it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to mix it up</font>

286
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:01,410
bgp and this speaks to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Randy's comments</font>

287
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,950
quite a bit it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a good tool for</font>

288
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:08,640
traffic management yet there's you know

289
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:11,430
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> no other way at some times meds</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">are broken if you look at if you looked</font>

291
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,989
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Randy's presentation he shows you one</font>

292
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,990

293
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,970
pass meds are another<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to really</font>

294
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,940
screw up bgp and i think DJ gave the

295
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,800
presentation of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while back</font>

296
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:29,160
oscillation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a pain in the butt I have</font>

297
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:32,790
a hierarchical bgp run Confederations

298
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,310
and on the border of the Confederations

299
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,890
that's exactly where I'm going to have

300
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:39,660
issues I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I've had to slow</font>

301
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:44,720
things down in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that go</font>

302
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:50,560
away hierarchies good

303
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:52,850
so that's IP hierarchy and having a

304
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,290
mechanism to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce the amount of</font>

305
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,329
information that all your edge devices

306
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,339
have to carry is great you can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

307
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:00,758
too far and and induce sub optimal

308
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:04,339
routing so you don't want to go too far

309
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:06,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">but some hierarchy is good and you don't</font>

310
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:08,470
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know everything on your on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

edge devices

312
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:20,650
okay conclusion I be hierarchy is good

313
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:23,960
parallel<font color="#CCCCCC"> ism is great if you're perfect</font>

316
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:33,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful and I think that you know I sort</font>

317
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:37,900
of pushed back on on mpls going native

318

<font color="#CCCCCC">questions</font>

328
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:18,130
sooo here's next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time posting a</font>

329
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:23,810
moderator a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions based on</font>

330
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:26,570
that comment on I GP is slow on on some

331
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:28,180
of your devices yes see more specific

332
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,870
and then what happens when

333
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:36,399
at the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> loads to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fast well</font>

334
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:38,110
it's it's more a matter of size we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

335
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,630
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thousand nodes in a</font>

336
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,920
network that have to converge and we

337
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,860
want to get them to convert really quick

338
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,979
I've got some rather antique edge

339
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:51,430
devices which because we've all gotten

340
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,870
really cheap now I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to have to</font>

341
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:54,870
upgrade in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact I'm not allowed to</font>

342
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:59,170
upgrade so I have to have mechanisms to

343
00:16:54,870 --> 00:17:00,790
keep those things running it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

344
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,529
SPF just takes it sometimes I don't even

345
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,300
get code form you know or they're very

346
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:06,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to get fitted for you know the SPF</font>

347
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,020
takes a long time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

348
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue to take a long time so reducing</font>

349
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:15,449
information and and you know removing

350
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:18,189
the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of CPU usage helps a lot</font>

351
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:20,890
second another question thing you

352
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:24,699
mentioned as you slowed down on your

353
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:28,600
Confederations at the edge oh I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

354
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:32,020
basically between the Confederate and

355
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:35,350
the sub<font color="#CCCCCC"> a/s boundaries there's a there</font>

356
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:37,059
you could watch actually when people

357
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,678
started using meds and it takes three

358
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:43,120
parties to make the Med problem really

359
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:46,000
nasty with certain people using their

360
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,790
meds they would cause an oscillation the

361
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,350
oscillation goes really fast get your

362
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:54,010
CPU burning about fifty percent on

363
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:57,040
devices that are pretty powerful the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

364
00:17:54,010 --> 00:18:00,750
to the way that we had to fix that with

365
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,090
one vendor at least was too slow down

366
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,920
the propagation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp information so</font>

367
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,050
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like to I'd</font>

368
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:10,520
like it to go you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

369
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,520
lightning speed across the network so

370
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:17,590
any other questions

371
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:20,668
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone get</font>

372
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,668
maybe he's going to the bathroom

373
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:24,739
coming to ask me

374
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:31,879
Brian Dixon Margaret hey um

375
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,389
does scalable

376
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:34,389
convergence

377
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:41,980
does using

378
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,850
that using hierarchical

379
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:48,940
yeah limit of

380
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:48,939
within an RGB or<font color="#E5E5E5"> using possibly</font>

381
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:55,510
scalability you know it's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a the</font>

382
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,210
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that sort of leads to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

383
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:01,450
that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only work if your allocation</font>

385
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,860
absolutely and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody remembers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

386
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:09,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">net knows we did a horrible job of</font>

387
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:11,469
allocating internally<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start and we've</font>

388
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,120
gotten a lot better now those who those

389
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:17,710
who might remember we've actually done a

390
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,939
lot to renumber things we have a we've

391
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,940
had a lot of conversations about

392
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:23,560
hierarchical I gps and and I by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

393
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,060
just just a preface<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the way everybody</font>

394
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:30,129
does I'm not speaking for him see I'm

395
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:33,780
speaking for myself I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

396
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:36,010
seen the need for a hierarchical<font color="#CCCCCC"> I GP</font>

397
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,800
for the simple fact that I've always

398
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:41,320
managed to find a way to to make it work

399
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,919
without having to put one in and and

400
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:50,139
that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something more with</font>

401
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:52,030
laziness than anything else but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's we</font>

402
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,760
actually turned off the bits that that

403
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:57,990
were sort of leading us down towards the

404
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,340
hierarchical<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP about a year or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two ago</font>

405
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,940
the convergence for most of the devices

406
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:06,820
is well under sub second it's only these

407
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,560
few devices that that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

408
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually hide information from anyways</font>

409
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,260
that we have left that are that are sort

410
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:17,380
of slow so

411
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:17,379
no I just sort of never really pushed it

412
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:25,149
is just on the use of igp vs bgp for

413
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:27,850
in brief its inclusion yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely</font>

414
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:30,399
you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need a whole lot near</font>

415
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:32,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">IGP except for the loop backs even the</font>

416
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:34,330
point-to-point interfaces the IP parts

417
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,299
of the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> for I esaias at least don't</font>

418
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:42,428
necessarily need to be there it's it's

419
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:45,580
we do carry a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more we might carry</font>

420
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:48,850
some phantom next hops for example to

421
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,049
create a nice EMP situation for traffic

422
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,389
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want traffic to hit two</font>

423
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:54,639
different nodes at the exact same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I</font>

424
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:57,459
might you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> be s the igp into</font>

425
00:20:54,639 --> 00:20:59,199
thinking that it's got a next hop on two

426
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,120
different nodes and its equivalent and

427
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,980
then it get forwarded there but in
