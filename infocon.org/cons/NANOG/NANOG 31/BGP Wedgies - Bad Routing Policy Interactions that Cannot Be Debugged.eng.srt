00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
my friend Tim tells the first time he

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:05,740
spoke at Nana

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,559
he was told everything will go right

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:11,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">this some blankie blankie Randy Bush</font>

gets up to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask questions</font>

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,018
and

7
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:21,490
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> taught</font>

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,250
oh oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not a portable mic because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> launder all</font>

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,390
see how this works

12
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:41,450
here we go and he says it was absolutely

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,220
horrifying and that I was really mean

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,070
and nasty i don't remember thing he's

15
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:48,440
lying but so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's done this time</font>

16
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:52,270
has forced me to give his talk this is

17
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,320
an engineer solution to the problem I

18
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,470
wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here it gives it brother</font>

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,110
well but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tim is an Intel research in</font>

20
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:03,890
Cambridge England which is associated

with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> university until and they kind</font>

22
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:14,470
of tread it in Iraq a bgp wedgie is done

23
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:19,110
is their portable mic

24
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:19,110
ok ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I'll stay here</font>

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:27,640
they want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see me they're desperate um</font>

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this multimedia</font>

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,350
that this thing only<font color="#E5E5E5"> works on one okay</font>

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,788
bgp policies make sense locally you can

29
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,610
look at your router's you know what your

30
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:39,789
policies are so sore okay but the

31
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:43,360
interaction of local policies allows

32
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:44,619
global multiple solutions and that's

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,770
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the point of this it's a key</font>

34
00:01:44,619 --> 00:01:52,149
points will show to you okay in fact bgp

35
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:54,819
is multi stable in a global interpreter

36
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:59,110
situation some solutions are what you

37
00:01:54,819 --> 00:02:01,320
meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay some solutions are not what</font>

38
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:04,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">you meant</font>

39
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,779
manual intervention can be required to

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,880
get it from one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those you didn't mean</font>

41
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:14,209
back to one of those who did meet and

42
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,400
when unintended solutions are installed

43
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:20,520
there can be situations where no single

44
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,260
provider a single provider has the

45
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,670
global knowledge sufficient to

46
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,670
understand what the heck zactly

47
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:32,939
this is not good by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

48
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,679
this is the BGP problem talk like this

49
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:37,189
afternoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you a BGP ain't so</font>

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,189
bad time

51
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,310
ok

52
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,560
this one's stuff we all know but I'm

53
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,830
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to sneak up on it slowly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

54
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,080
we want to shed inbound traffic we have

55
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,920
two links between two providers

56
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:58,400
providing customer and we want the

57
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:02,720
traffic to go this<font color="#E5E5E5"> way so we prepend on</font>

58
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:07,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s path</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay which is a disgusting</font>

59
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,200
little hack but kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of works</font>

60
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:13,040
so

61
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,200
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> all flows down this path</font>

62
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,219
yeah I have to run it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to occasionally to</font>

63
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:24,619
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this powerpoint crap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the police thing</font>

64
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:30,349
and it doesn't always work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay because</font>

65
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:34,340
in this case as3 is going to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

66
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:37,238
here because the provider always prefers

67
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,239
customer

68
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,330
so even though I'm prepending up the

69
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:46,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">yin-yang here this guy's traffic is</font>

70
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:50,569
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's because you</font>

71
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,569
can see an argument between me and

72
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,440
embarrassed I forget

73
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,440
I think Vince fuller back in about

74
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,000
ninety six<font color="#E5E5E5"> where essentially it became</font>

75
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,880
clear that when you have multiple

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,060
peering points between<font color="#E5E5E5"> two providers so</font>

77
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,459
that provider a announces the same thing

78
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,810
at both peering points they have to

79
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:14,690
prefer their customers to their<font color="#E5E5E5"> ears in</font>

80
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:17,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">announcing prefixes</font>

81
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:20,149
so that provider is can send that

82
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,550
traffic this way so it doesn't always

83
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:27,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">work so how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of that it's</font>

84
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:30,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> communities to the rescue so what we</font>

85
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:33,799
do is this provider says hey you can

86
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:37,040
send me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a community or for the movement</font>

87
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,500
call it normal which says the pref is a

88
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,560
hundred my normal customer preference or

89
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,500
you can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a different community</font>

90
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,000
which drops it lower and that's how i'll

91
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,969
send you

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,999
back up community

93
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:57,350
you say oh I'll put that before lower

94
00:04:52,999 --> 00:05:00,370
than my peer so i'll take the pier route

95
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:04,440
it seems to do what we love

96
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:09,639
this a s has this policy

97
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:12,240
and it said it nice and low

98
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,240
but

99
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything's not going to be perfect now</font>

100
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:20,239
this is a critical thing recognize this

101
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:23,010
elbow because you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it again later</font>

102
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this is a provider customer link</font>

103
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:28,349
this is brighter customer link peers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

104
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,530
use the vertical thing to show this all

105
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:34,920
the time so about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay customer see</font>

106
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:38,369
wants a backup link customer wants to

107
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:43,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">put a backup link in to see just in case</font>

108
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:48,030
things go bad right so they put in the

109
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:52,440
link and they send see a community that

110
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:55,739
says hey prefer your provider please i

111
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,080
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be ranked this this route</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ranked</font>

112
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,960
it lower than going this way so the

113
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,609
traffic properly goes that way just<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

114
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:09,138
we wanted disaster strikes<font color="#CCCCCC"> this leap</font>

115
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:14,319
breaks perfect

116
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:14,319
the backup worked just<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we want</font>

117
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:23,388
it's repaired

118
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:26,330
but this provider prefers customers the

119
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:28,729
community that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're sending year is</font>

120
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:31,938
not being sent there has no meaning

121
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:35,360
their community was low cleaning here we

122
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:40,909
are now in a bye in the other half of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

123
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:44,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">bistable situation by stable this is</font>

124
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:46,279
stable that stable by what's actually

125
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:52,149
multi stable in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're only</font>

126
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:52,149
two so it's by okay um and

127
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,000
this is going to stay

128
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,270
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be that way</font>

129
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,830
how does he get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it or she</font>

130
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,010
by the way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was not a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco bug</font>

131
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:25,568
don't laugh most because what fixes it

132
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:27,440
is reset this session and it will flip

133
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:30,050
back

134
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,969
and so he said all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stinkin cisco</font>

135
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:40,100
router here it wedged it didn't this was

136
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:42,950
protocol aspect this was your local<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

137
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:46,490
policy and their local BGP policy in

138
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:52,680
their local BGP policy interacting in

139
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:56,550
ways we didn't expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

140
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,750
it was but you reset this and it flips

141
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:04,530
back so it must have been a cisco bug

142
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:07,560
right it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is only half a</font>

143
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:10,440
wedgie<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because this person can</font>

144
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,690
actually figure it out if they've seen

145
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,860
this presentation and they can do

146
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:19,740
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what</font>

147
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:23,100
they could do more is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this provider</font>

148
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:27,419
when they got the preference that the

149
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:30,120
community from<font color="#E5E5E5"> here that said hey down</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">press</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me they could have translated it</font>

151
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,969
into this providers down pref community

152
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,020
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sent this provider the down breath</font>

153
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:46,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay pretty kinky huh</font>

154
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,560
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to build that</font>

155
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:53,910
level of complexity in but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what</font>

156
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:57,060
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually work okay</font>

157
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,760
now we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a three-quarter</font>

158
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,219
widget

159
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,720
by the way remember if you probably know

160
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,560
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> wedgies were it had to be explained</font>

161
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,560
to me my teenagers grew up a while ago

162
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">um</font>

163
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,670
I want a load balance I've got two

164
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,860
prefixes I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use this as the</font>

165
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,170
primary for this prefix and this is the

166
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:23,250
primary for this prefix and reverse<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

167
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:26,910
backups ok so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the old</font>

168
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:32,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">community hack and all that stuff and we</font>

169
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:34,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">have this route we have that route so me</font>

170
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:38,100
to this traffic goes this way p 1 is

171
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,890
traffic goes that way I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> load balanced</font>

172
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,350
everything's cool both sides no my

173
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:49,610
community no my prefixes so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

174
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:52,440
these breaks I'm cruising<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this</font>

175
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:55,050
is a three-quarter wedging because it

176
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,400
has all the stuff of the last one I'm

177
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,260
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into the detail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

178
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">how it breaks because remember this</font>

179
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:05,220
shape that's the same shape as last time

180
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:07,709
but what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the either of these</font>

181
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:11,700
lame look breaks and this is actually

182
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:14,220
try stable okay because it can go either

183
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:19,710
way and it's broken and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

184
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:22,980
do is reset both links and I have to be

185
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,750
smart enough to reset both legs now the

186
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:29,040
reason it only gets three quarters

187
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:31,080
credit is two reasons number one if I'm

188
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,530
smart enough and I guarantee or not I

189
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:37,860
could I did have the information to

190
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:42,030
understand it just here and secondly I

191
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,320
could fix it just here I can reset both

192
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,780
sessions

193
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,300
now theoretically I can reset those

194
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:51,140
sessions but anybody who's running a

195
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,819
provider you know that's of any scale

196
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,610
imagine calling your ops people and

197
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:00,090
telling them could<font color="#CCCCCC"> you reset the BGP</font>

198
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,560
sessions to both providers by the way

199
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:07,050
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to lose connectivity for</font>

200
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:10,500
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes right that's about as</font>

201
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:14,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">likely as cash falling from the sky</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

202
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:17,190
so that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> three quarter wedgie because</font>

203
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:21,230
I could know enough to do it and I could

204
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:21,230
fix it and I could run out of batteries

205
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,680
I saw one of those were

206
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,420
maybe that's what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

207
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,130
this one's out of batteries to know

208
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,550
there we go

209
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:35,920
right in mind ok so that's why i'd only

210
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,859
gets three quarters credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to cut</font>

211
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,069
two links but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could know it I could do</font>

212
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,830
it

213
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:46,670
okay what's going on there is no

214
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:50,170
guarantee that a BGP configuration in

215
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:53,780
the global sense has a unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution</font>

216
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:57,589
there can be multiple solutions and the

217
00:11:53,780 --> 00:12:00,050
order of<font color="#E5E5E5"> updates will control which one</font>

218
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,980
comes which of the multi stable

219
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,979
solutions wings

220
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:12,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why there's no guarantee that a</font>

221
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:14,370
BG piece configuration has any solution

222
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:18,420
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way and checking them as an</font>

223
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:22,560
np-complete problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and there are</font>

224
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:25,290
situations in the lab<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that goes back</font>

225
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,819
the first one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have shown that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

226
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:33,030
bgp solutions that can oscillate

227
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:35,250
continually and lastly complex policies

228
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:38,970
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> more complex we make it you know</font>

229
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:41,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm a great fan of complexity um weights</font>

230
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,470
community setting preference and so on

231
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:48,360
increase the chances of routing

232
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:51,170
anomalies the kink here you make it the

233
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:55,209
weirder the outcome

234
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:58,929
and now a full which is coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

235
00:12:55,209 --> 00:13:02,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we insert into the last pretty</font>

hey prefer your provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> Doug but let me</font>

only if both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these links break pardon</font>

242
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,610
me this link in this link break should

243
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:39,610
you send traffic to me please and I send

244
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:44,350
to D a community that says hey prefer me

245
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:46,809
under above prefer me before your

246
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:50,129
provider but less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> your peer so the</font>

247
00:13:46,809 --> 00:13:50,129
traffic goes this way

248
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,980
of course

249
00:13:53,240 --> 00:14:00,310
the carrier's come through again and

250
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:02,990
break the link backhoe day get working

251
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:08,839
petzl going there<font color="#CCCCCC"> this switched over</font>

252
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:13,160
here whammy it's restored oops now we

253
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:17,120
understand why this is happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

254
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:22,850
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am now looking at providers DS</font>

255
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:28,520
traffic coming in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I don't know</font>

256
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:32,529
why and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with d to fix</font>

257
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,529
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have to reset</font>

258
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:42,540
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I take this down it's going to switch</font>

259
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:42,540
here so I can't just reset that session

260
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:52,770
I have no reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think provider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> G is</font>

261
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:55,860
involved ok I have to reset both these

262
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:59,329
links simultaneously and I don't no

263
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:04,050
longer have the information to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

264
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok and that's a full widget I have to</font>

265
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:08,880
reset both those links and I have to

266
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell my knock by the way you're going to</font>

267
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,330
reset a perfectly good working session

268
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:22,219
and what do you think they're ready say

269
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:25,110
to me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be polite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

270
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:28,500
here's your full wedgie how'd we get

271
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:30,870
here again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PGP always make sense</font>

272
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:35,070
locally but the interaction of local

273
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:38,399
policies has weird global solutions and

274
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:41,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's multi stable some are what you</font>

275
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:44,040
wanted and some aren't what you wanted

276
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:47,010
you have to kick it to get back to what

277
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,449
you wanted and sometimes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

278
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,450
the knowledge to kick it

279
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,920
okay what couldn't we do

280
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:06,000
be careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find communities very</font>

281
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:09,290
sparsely don't get carried away with

282
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,030
tons of definitions and maybe consider

283
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:15,680
translating them and transiting up the

284
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:22,470
words if you remember the first case was

285
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:25,530
I could have when I could have said when

286
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:28,020
this provider received the down pref

287
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:30,180
community they could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> said oh he's</font>

288
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,910
telling me to down breath I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

289
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:37,250
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take that retag it and use her</font>

290
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,250
down pref community when I tell her

291
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,400
and that's all she<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrote</font>

292
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:49,759
rox questions now tim has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk up and</font>

293
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:52,999
ask a nasty question Tim where are you

294
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,999
how long

295
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:02,960

choose surprising we have local

302
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:24,849
mechanisms we're surprised because they

303
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,850
don't have global semantics

304
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:33,300
and your suggestion translating the

305
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:37,770
communities is simply one to give that

306
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:41,870
community global significance why not

just<font color="#CCCCCC"> Li talk about the final</font>

through community through to a but see

327
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:51,149
doesn't always do that so seek an OC

not be good

331
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,610
let's go

332
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,270
grace LBG

333
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,469
why did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start off by saying that BTW</font>

what I wanted was this that's good

337
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:31,260
right and I had like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it pardon why is it</font>

338
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:33,450
good because i'm paying ten cents a

339
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,760
megabit for this and two dollars and

340
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,760
make a bit for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so I want my traffic</font>

342
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and since both of those are my</font>

343
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,610

right to tell them how to write to me

the routing to do that capability all

348
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,299
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm paying them there might</font>

349
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,110
providers so I have the right to tell

350
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:02,760
them technically here's how to do it

351
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:06,030
you're the customer I'm the customer see

352
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:10,919
us here on ER right so I have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

353
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:12,178
to tell those two no pardon you don't

354
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,090
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a right to tell them how to</font>

355
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:19,470
function you're the customer no no they

356
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:20,879
are giving me a kabillion because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pay</font>

357
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:24,059
the money and if they don't I will

358
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,900
choose another provider and that is your

359
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:30,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">right right but I have now chosen to</font>

360
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:34,260
providers who do what I ask because I'm

361
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:37,970
paying the money right and what I ask is

362
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:42,090
they accept communities that let me

363
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:44,039
preference their preferences and they

364
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:46,408
are being perfectly good providers

365
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:48,780
there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with what they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

366
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:51,480
doing they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right thing</font>

367
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,730
what's wrong as the technology we're

368
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,940
using isn't doing it the simple way

369
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,620
because it ends up this way on the more

370
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,039
expensive link and that's not what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

371
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,039
wanted

372

<font color="#CCCCCC">tended to be me here d technology isn't</font>

373
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,070
the bad part here it's the person d is

374
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,470
the one that's circumventing everything

375
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,570
nobody is circumventing anything and

376
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:19,380
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> D in this foil keep going</font>

00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:23,260

wedgie configuration there this one

380
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:31,450
these not circumventing anything d is

381
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,159
going giving traffic to its provider who

382
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:38,220
is paying money to accept its traffic

383
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,220
but you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer is blind see</font>

384
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,930
pedra who are you

385
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,389
from I don't speak on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my employer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> either</font>

386
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,650
yes but it's still nice nobody speaks

387
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,860
through their employer but they should

388
00:21:48,650 --> 00:22:00,050
tell people just in case without meaning

389
00:21:51,860 --> 00:22:03,770
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are slightly biased especially</font>

390
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:08,149
when that employers a vendor so what

question of a little bit on same plane

393
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:16,940
so we have profile array now you're not

397
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,160
aren't we having to economical equations

398
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:32,440
that conflict<font color="#E5E5E5"> with each other rather</font>

on economical models

402
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:43,309
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

403
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,690
we can back up<font color="#E5E5E5"> for letters that aren't</font>

404
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,820
here one of the problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

405
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:53,130
problems do we have way up at the top

406
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:56,100
that we haven't discussed one of them is

407
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:58,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp is all about policy and not at</font>

408
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">all about metrics or as an igp is all</font>

409
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:03,590
about metrics not about policy and

410
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:08,760
that's a dilemma we've been in for years

411
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:12,360
number two is the policy we have is all

412
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:14,640
about influence upwards the jewels we

413
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:21,080
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all about influence upwards not</font>

414
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,080
negotiation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but</font>

415
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:26,150
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I disagree with you it's</font>

416
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:30,409
we've got a whole new<font color="#E5E5E5"> world about how to</font>

417
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:33,860
discuss policy and I don't think we have

418
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:35,900
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools to do that today and when we</font>

419
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,840
do if we feel we want them when we start

420
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:41,540
to build them then I would suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd</font>

421
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:46,679
be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful about the country just</font>

422
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:51,780
saw something on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the floor you did</font>

423
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:54,000
um we'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very careful not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to introduce</font>

424
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:58,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">the kinds of complexities that allowed</font>

425
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,700
us to get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is my real question</font>

426
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,680
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

427
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,230
we had different tools would be

428
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:08,410
acceptable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

429
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,920
they're a policy

430
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:15,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">by customer doesn't</font>

431
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:18,640
that's the transitive policy question

432
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:22,410
whether this person should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

433
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,550
put community on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> trans goes to their</font>

434
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:27,460
transitive communities and therefore

435
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:29,919
influences their policy to problems with

436
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:32,860
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> communities transitive and</font>

437
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:35,380
the second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I'm not being paid by</font>

438
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:39,840
you why should you be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dork with</font>

439
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,840
my policy yep

440
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:46,100

00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:53,510
actually three things what is the basis

everyone actually tries to or most

providers are does this also happen

516
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:55,180
inside of a pro fighter where they're
