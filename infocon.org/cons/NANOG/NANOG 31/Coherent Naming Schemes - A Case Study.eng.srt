00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:06,060
hello my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Matthew angle I'm from</font>

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,519
Tufts University I'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,349
according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the title coherent naming</font>

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,790
schemes a case study or what to do when

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,200
you get fed<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and decide to rename your</font>

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:18,359
interview in every one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your network</font>

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices so here's pretty much how it</font>

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:24,420
worked somewhere around februari to

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,159
march of this year we realized that we

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,519
needed a standard naming convention for

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,720
everything including routers switches

12
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:34,040
wireless AP is of which we're getting

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,809
large amounts of very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly</font>

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,420
security devices and of course whatever

15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,459
comes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> next now this kind of neat</font>

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:46,440
doesn't come from out of the blue so

17
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,660
what drove it it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> horrible three</font>

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,390
campuses all in<font color="#E5E5E5"> east eastern</font>

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:56,309
Massachusetts varying widths apart

20
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:59,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">fifteen routers 400 switches and many</font>

21
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,589
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways of naming things there was no</font>

22
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,459
standard it was very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ad-hoc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

23
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,570
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoever deployed it said well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

24
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:07,798
it's on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second floor of the</font>

25
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,220
psychology building so name it

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,310
psychology to or psychology to unit 0 if

27
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,310
they were being really really technical

28
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:19,259
alternately get people naming things by

29
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,229
the name of the by what the equipment

30
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,689
was so there's the 7507 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> miller halls</font>

31
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,539
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> miller 7507 or stuff along those</font>

32
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,589
lines it really took hits on

33
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,930
productivity<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

34
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all that much but I mean in</font>

35
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,159
terms of troubleshooting<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay fine well</font>

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,630
we know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know data tech calls</font>

37
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,220
said well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the switch in room 215</font>

38
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,470
well we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any switches their</font>

39
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,990
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> something to 15 okay well that's on</font>

40
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,399
the second floor ok it's not building

41
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,979
maybe that's the switch we meant and

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,110
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well is that's the one well</font>

43
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,310
maybe is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the 10 maybe and you end</font>

44
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,390
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through and it takes 10 minutes</font>

45
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:57,689
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sucks so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then you have stuff like</font>

46
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,250
equipment deployment even saying oh I

47
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,500
gotta name this device so what in the

48
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,990
world do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I name it I have no idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

49
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,869
it goes here I'll deal with it later and

50
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,848
if deal with it later means one day here

51
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:10,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">and one day there for another device you</font>

52
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">put enough devices out in the field</font>

53
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,260
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about large amounts of</font>

54
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,710
delays and employment just because it's

55
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,720
a little bit

56
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,600
harder for someone to do their job<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

57
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,859
not all that much harder either

58
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,299
documentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I / do you think it can</font>

59
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,760
pretty much go without saying automation

60
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,930
efforts as well you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

61
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard naming scheme there's no real</font>

62
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,990
way to say well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's what the</font>

63
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:35,790
switch is named that's how we'll monitor

64
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:37,440
it so here's what we had when we had a

65
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,269
building well what was it well it's the

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,100
psychology building well it's a twin

67
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:44,190
throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> Street well it's carpenter house</font>

68
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,320
well it's building m52 according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

69
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,730
buildings and grounds and each of these

70
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,650
got used in turn at various points

71
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,179
whenever somebody named him to call it

72
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,510
organic growth I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be the nice</font>

73
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,270
way to put it location information well

74
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay fine there's no there's no number</font>

75
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,880
on this room but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the switch</font>

76
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,080
closet is will call it by the room next

77
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,870
to it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll just figure it out when</font>

78
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time comes inconsistent data in the</font>

79
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,820
name so okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we a tab is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name of</font>

80
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,640
a building I tots the administration

81
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:15,420
building so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's tab and it's in</font>

82
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,820
the data center<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's a faster in 15</font>

83
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,100
k and it's in quad a and its unit<font color="#CCCCCC"> one or</font>

84
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:24,090
you've got the tab big iron wherever

85
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,430
that may be or the research and to

86
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,710
probably mean something and<font color="#E5E5E5"> BFI AK or</font>

87
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,600
whatever and then you have arbitrary

88
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,160
interface names tufts PRI border which

89
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,780
looks really cool on a traceroute but

90
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,359
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually mean anything or</font>

91
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">sac</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> router</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 which you know men some</font>

92
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,660
means something to people once they get

93
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,380
enough institutional memory but not

94
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:46,170
until then now this top one this

95
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,549
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened i had someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me</font>

96
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,140
everyone knows that the switch for

97
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,490
cousins<font color="#CCCCCC"> jim is actually in halligan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hall</font>

98
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:54,989
in that room<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

99
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:57,930
on the door in fact i've also had

100
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,610
somebody tell me that switch is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

101
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:05,070
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> where that switch they uninstalled</font>

102
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:06,600
two years ago used to be yes this is New

103
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,079
England those kind of directions while

104
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:13,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">cute aren't really useful so even though</font>

105
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,570
you hear them all the time so also<font color="#E5E5E5"> names</font>

106
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,488
de based on device hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> sackler 7507</font>

107
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:22,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in the Sackler building</font>

108
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:23,669
and it's a 7507 okay that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could be</font>

109
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,080
useful to somebody right up until the

110
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:26,490
point where you fumble through and

111
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,750
figure out people talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you talk</font>

112
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,960
to the data text and you figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

113
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,150
they

114
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,750
and you realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that oh yeah we change</font>

115
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,429
that into a big iron sorry myth of

116
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,349
naming security I've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say</font>

117
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,690
well you know do you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> your names to</font>

118
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:41,310
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally screw double by someone doing</font>

119
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:44,190
a trace route from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outside and</font>

120
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,750
besides saying okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know especially</font>

121
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,099
dedicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacker is going to be able</font>

122
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">to map your network no matter what you</font>

123
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:52,919
do and why make it harder for you if

124
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not making it any harder for them</font>

125
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,020
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean sure you could run split-brain</font>

126
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,460
dns and anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside would have</font>

127
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,039
anything in the net tough said you

128
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,258
domain resolve to chicken I don't

129
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,880
particularly care but you know all the

130
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,889
chicken in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world is not going to</font>

131
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop a sufficiently dedicated attacker</font>

132
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:11,910
from figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out exactly what's going</font>

133
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:13,229
on and someday you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be outside your</font>

134
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">own network and you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to</font>

135
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:21,180
trace route in and chicken will not help

136
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:22,830
you either so what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> needed we decided</font>

137
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,320
okay what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> a naming scheme have to</font>

138
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,639
have well comprehensible you have to be

139
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,889
able to read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and know exactly what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

140
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,060
means I mean that that that pretty much

141
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:33,030

152
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,690
but you've got to be able to do a

up with the minimal set of data that

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,960
these two devices would have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

one it has to be formulaic you have to

170
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:37,710
say given a set of parameters let's say

171
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,688
for a switch if i give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the building</font>

what this does is it changes the name

from being just this magical incantation

183
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,839
that's a series of 20 characters that

198
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:35,179
now so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a CMV RNA KS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cambridge</font>

to the telco and I've seen various

your own special<font color="#E5E5E5"> telco derived standard</font>

to do with anybody compression artifacts

225
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,219
everyone abbreviates differently that's

226
00:08:38,688 --> 00:08:41,718
just that's just the nature what's easy

remember for somebody else as you put

00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:48,740
stuff in the end everybody has their own

230
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,680
opinions on on abbreviation for example

231
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:55,000
we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a the name of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metal medical</font>

233
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,990
well you could either spell it out and

234
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,970
that's seven letters you could

235
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,160
abbreviate it to the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> syllable si</font>

241
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,719

242
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:22,029
we did see it abbreviated any number of

250
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,310
belongs it doesn't matter when your

trace routing that something is a 7507

252

00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's routing packets so why bother</font>

254
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,170
putting in the name because that and

255
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,279
much like comments in a program where

256
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,829
you're modifying the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not the</font>

257
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,740
comments comments lie so I put the

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:56,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">irrelevant information in make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

259
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,790
restrict the name to a location in a

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,320
roll this way the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to stay</font>

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:05,540
the same regardless of what hardware is

262
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:07,220
actually filling those shoes so if the

263
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,110
telco is an authoritative naming source

264
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,820
and our<font color="#CCCCCC"> own wild imaginations aren't an</font>

265
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,529
authoritative naming source you know

266
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,330
find an authoritative naming source in

267
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,430
this case this would be the space

268
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,990
planning department of Tufts University

269
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,339
for building names and they gave us a

270
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,140
very very nice spreadsheet had

271
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:23,720
everything on it and the official names

272
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,830
for buildings and that's what we use you

273
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,170
have an authoritative source you can

274
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:30,440
continually go to it they update it not

275
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:31,610
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's within the university the</font>

actual room numbers as it turns out this

278
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:36,529
was a service for everybody involved

279
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,930
because they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> put room number is</font>

280
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:44,439
on a lot of the rooms after<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were done</font>

281
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:50,689
with it so a formal grammar I actually

282
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:54,290
wrote up a formal BNF lalr 1 grammar for

283
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,270
the naming scheme and turned the crank

284
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,880
and put every single device we had

285
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,529
through that naming scheme just to make

286
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,880
sure it would fit and this failed a

287
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:03,680
couple of times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was good but</font>

the naming scheme for some Platonic

ideal of a network which probably has

very little to do with yours so list

what your assumptions are less what your

there were three basic kinds of links

correct information and things followed

people will type in longer names if they

can be derived this this has been shown

407
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:02,760
to do is since what we were optimizing

408
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,280
for is readability of a trace route that

409
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,080
it would be named Sackler be provider

410
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,339
because that would tell us who to

411
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,690
complain to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you when things happen</font>

412
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,820
because even though it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

413
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:14,130

414
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,490
know how they do this in their in their

415
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:19,290
internal network so given that we need

416
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,370
we need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to tell okay we nag</font>

we were optimizing for pre driving all

the devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> themselves host names for</font>

524
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,250
certain label naming interfaces did you

525
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,440
have to make any compromises or change

526
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:52,650
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> paradigm based on devices that</font>

527
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,630
simply say okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got 21 characters</font>

528
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:58,260
or 14 characters for a hostname or

529
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:59,940
interface name fortunately we did not we

530
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,050
not having any those device we didn't

531
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,420
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we didn't really have</font>

532
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:06,870
it actually we did not in fact have any

533
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:08,220
of those devices had we run into that

534
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,379
obviously we would have had to rethink

535
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,550
things but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the luxury of you</font>

536
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,800
know that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things we checked</font>

537
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:15,270
for first like okay according to this

538
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,580
naming scheme because you pretty derive

539
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:19,950
everything the longest name we're going

540
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:23,040
to have for a link well because remember

541
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:25,260
a link name doesn't necessarily isn't

542
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:29,149
going to exist on a host it just exists

543
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:32,460
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS so the hostname for example um</font>

544
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:34,320
the longest name that exists is between

what have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you because the front part is</font>

568
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,350
assumed you're standing on top of the

569
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,720
box I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason you end</font>

570
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,449
up with

571
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,630
very horribly truncated names that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

572
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:49,120
had in their first few slides were there

573
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:51,610
are for example catalyst or hybrid based

574
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,039
devices where you are stuck with very

575
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:55,840
short naming fields unfortunately i'll

576
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,640
certainly your vendor limitations is

577
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,110
probably one of the early steps in the

578
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,659
process here that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people need to think</font>

579
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:06,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">about certainly certainly any other</font>

580
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:08,260
questions it's just a quick comment

581
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,230
thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much for putting this</font>

582
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,970
together<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought the presentation is</font>

583
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:15,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">very practical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm kind of curious</font>

584
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:18,490
but what are the next steps given that

585
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:20,110
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a systematically drivable</font>

586
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:23,049
naming convention do you have any

587
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:26,139
foreseeable applications out of the area

588
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:27,850
of auto discovery or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like well</font>

589
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,320
number one this allows for stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

590
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:33,750
like auto-discovery where you can say

591
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:36,580
okay well here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anderson router PRI</font>

592
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,380
figure out what's directly connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

593
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,178
it generate<font color="#E5E5E5"> your name generate your</font>

594
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,620
entire names I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because in the</font>

595
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:44,140
beginning we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manually generate</font>

596
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:47,260
everything and put it all in and it is a

597
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,549
tribute to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Robin garner network</font>

598
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,470
engineering that we have a DNS

599
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:52,090
allocation database tool that is easy

600
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:56,860
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use and quick enough to use</font>

601
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:58,090
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it went very very quickly but what</font>

602
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,949
you have is you're allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do you can</font>

603
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:03,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can now do auto-discovery you now</font>

604
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:05,230
allow for event correlation because you

605
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,600
can take because you can have a machine

606
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:09,429
take apart the name you have all these

607
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,090
devices reporting and you no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer have</font>

608
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:15,700
to let's say I'm use nagios for ping

609
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,649
monitoring well you know you now no

610
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,409
longer have to manually generate the

611
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:24,039
parent relationships in nagios because

612
00:24:20,409 --> 00:24:26,590
you have encoded in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> name the parent</font>

613
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:28,750
relationships for great deal of<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices</font>

614
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,510
or you can do a traceroute take it apart

615
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:37,920
and and cobble names together out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

616
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:41,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">tracer outs out put any other questions</font>

617
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,580
nothing man thank you
