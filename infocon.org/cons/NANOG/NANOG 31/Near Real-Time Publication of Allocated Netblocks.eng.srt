00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,259
doing peering work there I'm relatively

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:17,279
new to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron i was elected</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the AC at</font>

the end of<font color="#CCCCCC"> last year and this</font>

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:25,109
presentation came out of essentially a

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,539
lot of complaints a Terran in that a lot

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,929
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been talking in the halls</font>

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,360
about this particular topic but no one

10
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,059
has put forth a proposal on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix</font>

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,920
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the AC decided at the last</font>

12
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,890
meeting that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we needed to consolidate</font>

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,770
what the problem is and what people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

14
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,670
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about and present it and</font>

15
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,340
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that came out of that</font>

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,890
is that we needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> more input from the</font>

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,050
operator community as to what would

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,170
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful so that's why I'm</font>

here<font color="#E5E5E5"> today presenting to you and I</font>

26
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what the problem is I'm sure for</font>

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,048
filter unallocated IP space and I'm

33
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,670
limiting the talk to this topic which

34
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:34,560
may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be obvious here but is obvious</font>

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,180
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Aaron membership in that Aaron</font>

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,670
can only really say whether a block is

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,950
allocated or not Aaron's never going to

<font color="#E5E5E5">make a value judgment of this person's a</font>

40
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,280
out malware or anything like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

41
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,829
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

42
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,049
to happen so this is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">taking sort of the data that you would</font>

get out of who is as to whether or not

there are services that do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this today</font>

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,149
probably many of you in this room use

55
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,409
something like that many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it</font>

56
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,180
internally with their own systems and

57
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:28,798
they do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for various</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons there are</font>

58
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,769
network operators who filter out

59
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:34,260
announcements who their server operators

60
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:38,939
who filter email you know it happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

61
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:41,370
all levels this brings up a lot of

62
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,418
problems though the first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

63
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we see in the erring</font>

64
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:46,739
community people don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust</font>

65
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,388
many of these sources as good as some of

66
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">these sources are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there volunteer groups</font>

67
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:52,769
there's no SLA there's no contract if

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,599
your country's rep if your company's

69
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:56,939
revenue depends on it you're probably

70
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:58,168
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trust them but there's all</font>

71
00:02:56,939 --> 00:03:00,780
sorts of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

72
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:03,889
there's delays there's additional data

73
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:07,139
because bogans is a very subjective term

74
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:10,549
so you know you're not getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> pure data</font>

75
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:12,780
and that's what a lot of people want

76
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:14,040
another problem that occurs that I'm

77
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,939
sure we've all seen talked about is

78
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,439
people do filter out announcements and

79
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:21,180
often those filters don't get updated

80
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,430
very quick so we've all seen the

81
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,159
complaints of you know first user in a

82
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,750
new block I can't get anywhere etc it

83
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:33,540
would be nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that were automated it</font>

84
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:36,840
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy for all of us to update so the</font>

85
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is what can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> erin do and that's</font>

86
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,009
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be clear here again</font>

87
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">Erin can provide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information about what</font>

88
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:45,358
has been assigned and what hasn't been

89
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:46,858
assigned and specifically in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the context</font>

90
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:50,280
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> erin they can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only provide that four</font>

91
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:52,590
blocks that Erin controls when you look

92
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,219
at the IP space as a whole there's

93
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,349
blocks controlled by iono /<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can that</font>

94
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:00,120
haven't been given to anybody yet then

95
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:03,418
there's blocks that are given to Erin to

96
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,609
write to<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP Nick to lack Nick and soon</font>

97
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:09,209
after Nick if you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know that's</font>

98
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:12,449
coming so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Erin can only do a small part</font>

99
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,949
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and part of why I'm here is one</font>

100
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:15,989
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rirs needs to take the lead in</font>

101
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:18,780

opportunity for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to show the other</font>

IRS what can be done so somebody's going

00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,779
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be first it won't be a</font>

105
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,039
complete<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution but hopefully we can</font>

106
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:27,260
get something that everybody wants to

107
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:30,570
implement

108
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,890
how could we provide this the three

109
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,540
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that always come up at an errand</font>

110
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,330
meeting you can put this information in

111
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,820
BGP you can put it in ldap you can put

112
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,880
it in DNS find solutions existing

113
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:45,180
protocols work good another solution

114
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:48,060
that is semi obvious as you could create

115
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,220
a brand new protocol we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> make who</font>

116
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,950
is some kind of transaction based

117
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,020
protocol that would allow you to

118
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,080
automate this in a way that parsing text

119
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,549
output just isn't conducive to and part

120
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,750
of the reason I'm here is this other

121
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:05,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">category we would like input</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from all</font>

122
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,960
the smart people in this room and

00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">anywhere else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who have a really good</font>

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how this could work and have</font>

125
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,260
work with things like RFC process and

126
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,720
going to the IETF meetings and so forth

127
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us figure out the right solution</font>

128
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,560
and document it so that it's then easier

129
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,250
for Aaron<font color="#CCCCCC"> to implement and easier for</font>

130
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,080
them to go to ripe and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> places and</font>

131
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,060
say look here's a document here's how we

132
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,440
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it here's how everyone should do it</font>

133
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:34,680
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works from Aaron's point of view</font>

134
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,710
there's a few problems here it seemed a

135
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,330
bit as a minefield because you know the

136
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,680
service obviously if people are using it

137
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:45,780
for real time filtering has to be

138
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:49,290
reliable<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has to be accurate which for</font>

139
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:53,789
the data held by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR itself is not a</font>

140
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:55,169
big issue however there's a lot of space

141
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was for instance assigned by the</font>

142
00:05:55,169 --> 00:06:01,049
internet for which aaron today simply

143
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,929
publishes some of the data but in many

144
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,760
cases doesn't really officially control

145
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,450
it and so it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

146
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,640
guarantee accuracy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron will obviously</font>

147
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,440
have to expend resources Aaron is

148
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,390
self-funding so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a concern</font>

149
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,900
how much will it<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost well they have to</font>

150
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:22,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">raise fees there is potential for</font>

151
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,620
liability here that doesn't or it raises

152
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bar for liability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I should say</font>

153
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,580
obviously wrong data in who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> today has</font>

154
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,050
an effect but if it immediately goes out

155
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,099
to real-time filtering and all the big

156
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,330
networks that effect is amplified and

157
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:37,420
certainly a big concern and one of the

158
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,580
reasons aaron has an

159
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,680
affected is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's viewed that any</font>

160
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,570
solution that we implement will probably

161
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,020
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be supported for forever we're</font>

162
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,099
forever probably means the life of ipv4

163
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,169
if that's the data we're talking about

164
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably forever and then</font>

165
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are going to want it for any</font>

166
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:56,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">follow-on protocol as well so there's a</font>

167
00:06:54,040 --> 00:07:02,200
great impetus here to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this correct</font>

168
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:03,880
the first time as i already said it's

169
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,150
very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the other IRS have</font>

170
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,640
the same data<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin only has a subset of</font>

171
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,739
it if only Erin provided filtering data

172
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:16,479
it probably wouldn't be used by a lot of

173
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:19,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">people and as I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some more</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for the errant audience but erin has the</font>

reason we're kind of running with this

180

right now but if there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,550

hearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as well so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question is</font>

183
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,320
how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nog help for those of you who</font>

184
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,450
haven't been<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an errand meeting erin</font>

185
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,909
has an open policy process it's based on

186
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,700
community consensus you don't have to be

187
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,230
an errand member to propose a policy you

188
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,170
don't have to be an errand member to

189
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:56,680
attend the open part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting so</font>

190
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:58,450
any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can participate many of you</font>

191
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,580
happen to be Erin members through your

192
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,900
company's anyway probably a lot of

193
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in this room have IP space</font>

194
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:09,150
directly from<font color="#E5E5E5"> erin and and so this</font>

195
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,710
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a group that can provide input</font>

196
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:14,770
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't realize</font>

197
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,719
until i got involved with erin is that a

198
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,120
lot of the people who attend air in

199
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,000
meetings today have a policy and

200
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,220
administrative background they don't

201
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,610
touch a router they don't touch a server

202
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,560
they manage IP space IP allocations

203
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:33,190
they're worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the resource usage</font>

204
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,520
those kinds of issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so when you</font>

205
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,530
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about would be GP or LDAP be a more</font>

206
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,720
efficient way of distributing the data

207
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:43,030
would it<font color="#CCCCCC"> be easier to configure on your</font>

208
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,770
outer those sorts of things that gets

209
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">lost on a significant percentage of the</font>

210
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,490
people at an errand meeting today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

211
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,750
that's part of the reason we need more

212
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,970
people with that hand

213
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:55,210
on background providing input on those

214
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,710
issues and again we have the joint

215
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,900
meetings there was one in Chicago

216
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:01,900
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one coming up this fall in</font>

217
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,699
reston certainly we encourage anybody

218
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,069
who can stay the extra couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

219
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:10,150
stay on and see what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on and</font>

220
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:12,370
provide input what<font color="#E5E5E5"> really needs to be</font>

221
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:15,790
developed is technical specifications at

222
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:17,200
this point because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

223
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,939
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion forward until</font>

224
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,520
there's something concrete to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

225
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:24,640
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people can stand up and say</font>

226
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,990
guess we need filtering data but that

227
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,540
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get us anywhere people</font>

228
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,590
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually present a proposal</font>

229
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,180
probably some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them will be shot down</font>

230
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,820
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> first but we need something concrete</font>

231
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:35,290
to talk about and the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of</font>

232
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,950
things here is the same list of concerns

233
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,870
I gave before this is an area where

234
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,660
those who operate things probably know

235
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,910
better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you run a</font>

236
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,130
bogan route server these are the people

237
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,719
who attack it this is how much bandwidth

238
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:53,980
it takes those sorts of things can

239
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:56,230
provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of input I want to</font>

240
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">point out a couple of forums obviously</font>

241
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,120
the Nano mailing list is always good for

242
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,699
discussing operational issues the air

243
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,550
inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is P pml the public</font>

244
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,960
policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list this is where open</font>

245
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,170
discussions occur between the meetings

246
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,980
about various<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin related issues again</font>

247
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:16,930
there is a joint meeting in October and

248
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,940
all the other rirs for those who aren't

249
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,969
from the Erin region have their own

250
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,670
meetings pretty much all of the rirs

251
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,320
always attend each other's meetings so

252
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,959
they're certainly aware of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic</font>

253
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,600
they're all thinking about it I believe

254
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,690
ripe has actually looked internally at

255
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,730
some of the ways they could solve this

256
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:39,010
and so those local forms are also

257
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,470
appropriate you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know whether or not</font>

258
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,060
Aaron takes the lead is one issue once

259
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody has done this though it's going</font>

260
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have to go to all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

261
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:49,120
important so talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and</font>

262
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:54,310
other meetings and such would<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely</font>

263
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:57,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">be useful so I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is it if</font>

264
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:59,790
anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> has any questions happy to answer</font>

265
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,790
them

266
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:07,160
you can see myself or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kathy who's</font>

267
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,508
standing up with any input or other

268
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,990
things you might have after the meeting

269
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:14,689
and looks like kathy has something to

270
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,759
say we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you need this</font>

271
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:18,469
does anybody want to say whether they

272
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,410
need this whether they want this whether

273
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:25,189
they care at all we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really I mean we</font>

274
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:27,790
really want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to feedback so many</font>

275
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:29,870
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is useful I</font>

276
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:33,498
think what how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were reading</font>

277
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:37,730
their email and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people are</font>

278
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:39,889
asleep so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be more</font>

279
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,499
useful if you published information in

280
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:44,749
the form of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> roadmap rather than just a</font>

281
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:46,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP feet and then sure that's not real</font>

282
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:50,540
time but it's the right way to express

283
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:52,160
policy the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i'm referring to</font>

284
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">is basically that someone who wants to</font>

285
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,779
hijack space could just advertise along

286
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:59,529
the prefix than your advertising your

287
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:01,639
beach p<font color="#E5E5E5"> feed and get some use out of it</font>

288
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:04,879
that's absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct the only</font>

289
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,319
comment I would make about that is when

290
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">we look at what the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron membership</font>

291
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:12,740
talks about filtering rod announcements

292
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,050
definitely a primary goal but there are

293
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,699
as many if not more people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

294
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in being able to filter this</font>

295
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:19,878
on their email server because the guy in

296
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:24,350
China is never going to filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

297
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:26,329
announcements so that's I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

298
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,550
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an insurmountable hurdle it</font>

299
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:30,529
may be in the end if the community

300
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:32,959
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants route filtering and nothing</font>

301
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:35,420
else it may be we produce something like

302
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,518
that but we're trying to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> as many</font>

303
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,199
communities happy as we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> would it be</font>

304
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,120
a very heavy weight search just to

305
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:44,269
publish the current list of unallocated

306
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:47,139
or revoke space as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> route map in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

307
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:47,139
cisco sanitizer

308
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,750
it probably wouldn't be all that heavy

309
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:54,209
weight for those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

310
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:57,150
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is possible to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mulco is data</font>

311
00:12:54,210 --> 00:13:01,860
today that's primarily how these other

312
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:04,800
services publish it and so things could

313
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,900
be made available in different forms you

314
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,910
know if that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want proposed it</font>

315
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:12,949
an errand meeting make it a policy if

316
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,949
people want that that can be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

317
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,880
think there's a lack of trust not just

318
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,700
for complete who is and others but for

319
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,200
air in itself you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

320
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,700
that you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these allocations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

321
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,790
email addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't really improved</font>

322
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,050
there's no trust relationships built you

323
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,849
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know the exact information</font>

324
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,370
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gaining like even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sherco is you</font>

325
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:33,570
might know the eyes of<font color="#CCCCCC"> key name but</font>

you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in contact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there might be</font>

327
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:37,860
difficult as well that extends time that

328
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,290
makes things<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult I guess my</font>

329
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,430
question is you know while we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

330
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,439
trust complete who is people are

trusting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kim</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roux and other places more</font>

332
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,480
and more for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this type of data and I'm</font>

333
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:50,460
not sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people are operators want</font>

334
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,780
to trust Aaron with this type of data if

335
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,580
they were to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a service for it</font>

336
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:57,449
that might be a problem in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future</font>

337
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:59,040
out of it okay the the thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

338
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:02,340
have on that is there's a two-part

339
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,099
problem here right there's providing the

340
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,310
very simplistic data of is a block

341
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,560
allocated or not for which aaron is the

342
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,270
only source that knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and then</font>

343
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,949
there's the deeper problem of do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

344
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,230
a valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> email address do i have a valid</font>

345
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:18,710
snail mail address which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem</font>

346
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:21,510
regardless of the format it published in

347
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:23,880
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of concern about that in</font>

348
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,710
the erring community if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

349
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">ppm ll archives there's a lot of talk on</font>

350
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:30,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> subject and if you're interested I</font>

351
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:33,060
definitely recommend you pick that<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

352
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,880
because it quickly becomes a very thorny

353
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:39,780
problem and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> largest problem actually</font>

354
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:42,030
is for space that Aaron doesn't control

355
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:45,990
its legacy internet space that they're

356
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:48,569
not allowed to change for reasons above

357
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,590
them and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that blame goes to</font>

358
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,680
them because they run the whois server

359
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:54,300
that shows it to you but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly</font>

360
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,329
look at PP ml there's a lot of talk on

361
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:02,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">that subject but that's good input</font>

362
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:06,979
thank you who you thought you mentioned

363
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:11,179
for question of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to publish data and</font>

364
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:16,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">well okay I'm seeing problems how to</font>

365
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:20,689
deal of relatively with information

366
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:23,749
about bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> space however I would strongly</font>

367
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:28,910
suggest all of the rirs to consider

368
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:31,369
using our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl and the IRR to publish the</font>

369
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,170
address space that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have</font>

370
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:35,839
allocated and you mentioned you know

371
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:39,410
operatively what you have assigned and

372
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,110
it's a pity that we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RP SL and</font>

373
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:44,809
vir are and that data is not available

374
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:49,629
and cannot be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used in generating</font>

375
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:52,579
policies and it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy I</font>

376
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:53,989
think that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great suggestion and the</font>

377
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:56,649
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I can offer is that you</font>

378
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:59,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">should submit it via the public policy</font>

379
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:01,999
mailing list as a policy change that

380
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:03,559
they should publish that again<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron</font>

381
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:06,939
works on community consensus that's what

382
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:06,939
everybody wants that's what will happen

383
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:13,399
we're also going to take these comments

384
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:15,769
back with us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next meeting so it's</font>

385
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:16,939
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great if you want to come to</font>

386
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:20,299
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting but if you can't make it</font>

387
00:16:16,939 --> 00:16:24,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of this route map and what you said</font>

388
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:26,239
we'll also take that back with us Steve

389
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:28,248
guilt encumbering I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a</font>

390
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:30,559
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of clarifications the tight the</font>

391
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:32,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">format's data is available in as far as</font>

392
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:35,049
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data comes from team</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> covering</font>

393
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:39,669
currently you can retrieve<font color="#E5E5E5"> that through</font>

394
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:41,850
various forms HTTP as published in<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

our ad be ripe ripe object as well and a

397
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:49,529
couple of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> format's that come to mind</font>

398
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,920
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we try to make it as available as</font>

399
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:55,110
possible in various formats so our goal

400
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,990
is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it as widespread as possible</font>

401
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,670
so I guess what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying is the not</font>

402
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,230
the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of date I don't think there's</font>

403
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,540
one format that solves all the problems

404
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:06,059
some people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP feeds others</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer</font>

405
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,789
to filter based on you know a web form

406
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:10,730
or just text that they can download so

407
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:12,599
the types of formats and the

408
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,120
completeness therein will be very

409
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:18,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful that one comment I'd like to</font>

410
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,819
reiterate is the accuracy of anything

411
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:23,339
other than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> majors met blocks that</font>

412
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:26,639
are considered bogans today is very

413
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:31,260
skeptical the reason why we stick to the

414
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">basics whatever publishes is that other</font>

415
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,240
other formats that that we've seen

416
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,590
there's just been there's been a lot of

417
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,120
discrepancy in data and knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

418
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,709
that's accurate and if people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

419
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,299
starting to filter on data that's not

completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> accurate they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

421
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:48,720

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:50,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">is some way of verifying that you know</font>

that people here feel strongly that

something should be done here or feel

Aaron to get it done<font color="#E5E5E5"> or if it should be</font>

do anything at all if no one cares<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>
