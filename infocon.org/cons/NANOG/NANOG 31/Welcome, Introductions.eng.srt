7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:22,720
years I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more or less done with</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">and Michigan State among many</font>

44
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,589
universities who decided it would be

45
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,420
cool to network their mainframe

46
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,300

different manufacturers of course they

48
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,750
discovered pretty quickly there was no

49
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,560
readily available commercial solution to

50
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,760
do this decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it themselves</font>

00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:25,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">it was about 25 people there and I think</font>

109
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,780
something like five to eight people

110
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:30,539
actually got it working so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

111
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,719
bit it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit tricky but</font>

112
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,720
certainly possible

113
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:46,990
I'll in a minute so this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:49,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network diagram here shows some sort of</font>

115
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,840
view of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network here and the reason</font>

116
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the IP IP 6 server is that obviously</font>

117
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,260
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless network here it's really</font>

118
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,430
easy to eavesdrop on other people's

119
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,430
traffic so

120
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:06,340
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the area that that we're sort</font>

121
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:08,710
of worried<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and now at this meeting</font>

122
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,770
there's a new subnet over here with

123
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:15,010
ipsec server which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can establish a</font>

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:17,520
security association with and if

everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font>

126
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,970
this green line shows the path where

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,610
your packets would be encrypted and then

128
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,950
the red line shows the path where they

129
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,410
would be decrypted and of course it's

130
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same for going to the direction so</font>

if<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in using this</font>

one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions I get asked a lot</font>

213
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:27,600
is what a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cnet do the answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

214
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're a global online media company</font>

215
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,510
which translates to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a content provider</font>

216
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,800
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a bunch of different brands</font>

217
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:36,089
including the one that didn't show up

218
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,250
down there in the corner which is

219
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:42,570
mp3.com so it's too bad but most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

220
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,100
others you probably have seen in some

221
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:47,360
time or another the big red<font color="#CCCCCC"> scene at</font>

222
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,360
ball you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the place here</font>

223
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,610
the hotel network we have a gigabit

224
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,920
ethernet link from here to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our data</font>

225
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:59,360
center which is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mile and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a half</font>

226
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,769
away the all the it all you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are my</font>

227
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,889
laptops and the wiring connections are

228
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:05,329
one big flat / 22 network so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

229
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:08,870
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> open up firewall holes that's what it</font>

230
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:11,120
is multicast does not go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to this</font>

231
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:16,100
network so you can't watch yourselves i

232
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,630
guess but you can watch us there is an

233
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,339
authentication server this time on the

234
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">wireless network or on the wired network</font>

235
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:23,630
for that matter anybody who connects the

236
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,040
very first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to bring up a</font>

237
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,480
web browser you'll get a splash page

238
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,790
it'll ask you to type in the email

239
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,290
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you registered with if you</font>

240
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">can remember that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> type it incorrectly</font>

241
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,459
than you after that your laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

242
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,750
validated for the rest of the meeting if

243
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:37,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can't remember your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> email address</font>

244
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:40,010
then see us at the wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> desk in the</font>

245
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,160
back of the room and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can fix that for</font>

248
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,699
discover that this being San Francisco

249
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,280
there are a lot of wireless access

250

252
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,890
starbucks across the street so if you

253
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you might end up on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the wrong</font>

or whatever I used SSID<font color="#E5E5E5"> net I'm 31 we</font>

256
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:07,540
should have coverage in all the meeting

fiber link from here to the colo they

274
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:54,199
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually out here pulling it</font>

275
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,250
through the street as late as Thursday

276
00:12:54,199 --> 00:13:00,199
night but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of scheduling</font>

277
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,480
issue because they had a paying customer

278
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:04,819
who also wanted their fiber so it was

279
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,029
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to them to get this at in</font>

280
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:09,680
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> even with that money involved 365</font>

281
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:11,750
vein is our color provider where the

282
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,339
other end of the fiber<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we realized</font>

284
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:18,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to order the cross connect to IP ins</font>

285
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:21,110
fiber so they got it in real fast

286
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,758
without a formal order and without

287
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:25,160
