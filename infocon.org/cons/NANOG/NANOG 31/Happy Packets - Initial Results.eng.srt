1
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:10,080
so there was a reason that Susan I tell

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:20,060
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the bathroom that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my talk</font>

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:23,069
is next and sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that this gym is</font>

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,529
my co-investigator etcetera<font color="#E5E5E5"> etc but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

5
00:00:23,069 --> 00:00:28,140
can blame this one on me not Tim also

6
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:32,940
morally now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric purpose and done</font>

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:35,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">studs back etc there's some research</font>

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,349
we've been doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a while which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

9
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:41,059
the question is what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the relationship</font>

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:43,679
between control plane routing protocol

11
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:50,699
instability and data playing the path

12
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:56,909
that's getting there and is the quantity

13
00:00:50,699 --> 00:01:00,959
of BGP update good or<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad do we want 2c0</font>

14
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:06,780
bgp updates we believe in static routing

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:10,140
no so we hear reports that the Internet

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,350
routing is fragile and collapsing bgp is

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,270
broken and isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> working well yesterday</font>

18
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">was a bad day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet look at</font>

19
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:22,590
all those announcements<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if we</font>

20
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:26,340
change protocol x2 protocol why it will

21
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,039
improve routing and we seem to measure

22
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,189
routing dynamics and say that some

23
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:34,079
measurement is worse or better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

24
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,729
other by the way I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to warn you when</font>

the world are studying your networks as

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:48,810
a behavioral phenomenon you should be

scared you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very scared okay</font>

29
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,670
and I'm scared because I got feet on

30
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:56,880
both sides of the fence but<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

31
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,789
heck are we measuring we're told that a

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,048
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of bgp updates is internet</font>

33
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:05,700
instability all right they drove

34
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,039
internet update counts they say it's

35
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,980
unstable there are too many updates so

36
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:16,829
bgp must be broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have another mom</font>

37
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:21,629
vgp updates are like white blood cells

38
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:25,480
they are actually signaling a problem

39
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:29,560
but they're part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cure not part of</font>

40
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:32,590
the problem you cut a link and they're

41
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,500
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be bgp announcements because of</font>

42
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:39,239
it but they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

43
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:43,390
they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make the network heal</font>

44
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:46,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay beat the bgp announcements aren't</font>

45
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:51,160
the problem they're what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have today</font>

46
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:53,260
as a solution now measuring them does

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,739
give you some idea of the presence of a

48
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:59,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem but they are not a problem and</font>

49
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,359
it's not necessarily broken so when Andy

50
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,940
shows you this graph watch out it's a

51
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:07,569
log graph so that's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> significant</font>

52
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:12,660
spike and says my God look at the

53
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:16,268
exponential growth this is very bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

54
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:19,780
if this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not bad something bad</font>

55
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:23,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened this is reacting to it and</font>

56
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:27,220
fixing it for you now some warnings the

57
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:30,040
data i'm about to show is not exactly

58
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,540
comparable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> andy's data Andy studying</font>

59
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,578
you know he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at route fuse and</font>

60
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,548
looking at very big advance that that

00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:38,049
was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Code Red event okay we're I'm</font>

62
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:41,769
going to look at single announcements

63
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:44,319
I'm pretty slow<font color="#CCCCCC"> and stupid and so seeing</font>

64
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:47,859
all this big stuff is very confusing to

65
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,589
me so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not attacking and these</font>

66
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:52,389
assumptions or as measurements but we

67
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,370
suggest to consider some of them and

68
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:57,579
we're also measuring the<font color="#E5E5E5"> large-scale</font>

69
00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:00,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">data playing performance but what the</font>

70
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:03,099
heck is<font color="#E5E5E5"> good routing how do we say that</font>

71
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:08,519
route this meriting is better than that

72
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:11,319
routing unless we have metrics<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

73
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,930
we work on the assumption that the count

74
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:16,149
of prefixes or speed or completely our

75
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,880
measures of routing colony I don't think

76
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:20,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are I think the goal of the game is</font>

77
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,539
to get the Hat<font color="#E5E5E5"> the packet</font>

78
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:26,758
to the customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and the measures</font>

79
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:29,909
whether the users<font color="#CCCCCC"> pockets reach their</font>

80
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:34,460
destination if users packets are happy

81
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:38,188
the routing system is<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing its job and</font>

82
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:41,909
so I call it happy packets and there are

83
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:45,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">well known metrics for data plane delay</font>

84
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:47,729
drop jitter and reordering formally

85
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,030
defined and how to measure them is

86
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:53,789
formally defined so we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to set</font>

87
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:58,080
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to measure the control plane quality</font>

90
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:07,770
what we care about that's what I'm being

91

paid for<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in is be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but now one</font>

92
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:13,620
morning is router scaling of course if

93
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:15,889
it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> jillians of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp announcement so</font>

94
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,129
many that the router starts to fall over

95
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:26,129
then that's too many bgp announcements

96
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:31,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">but if be gps chattiness is under</font>

100
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:47,460
under Moore's law so I why I'm looking

<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to look at single announcements</font>

102
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,930
on this is from something Tim did called

103
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:56,938
what's the sound of one route flapping

104
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:58,710
and if I think of a router as a BGP

105
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,180
speaker that takes some announcements in

106
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,270
and withdrawals an announcement

107
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,250
withdrawal and amid something and<font color="#CCCCCC"> today</font>

108
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I look at the top in this simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5</font>

router configuration one announcement

110
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:14,759
and one withdrawal can produce 52

different possible results at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom</font>

sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> here looking at the bottom</font>

trying to understand what actually

115
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:29,399
happened there's not much hope so we're

116

trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at things very simply and</font>

00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:33,340
this is the

00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">arment we set up we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got something</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">called a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp beacon which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll explain</font>

00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,690
in a minute which is dual home to the

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,270
internet and out on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet we have</font>

122
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,490
a bunch of its announcing a prefix and

of packet streams coming towards that

125
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:56,920
prefix so there's the data plane and

126
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:58,990
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the control plane and well the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp beacon is is just something that</font>

128
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,520
takes a prefix in this case it's this

129
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,770
prefix and announces it dual home to the

130
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet and withdraws it at well-known</font>

two hours because route<font color="#CCCCCC"> flak damping</font>

has lost one of its links<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok two hours</font>

later it cuts the link again<font color="#E5E5E5"> etc etc</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

145
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,400
so during the<font color="#CCCCCC"> day it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I close to all</font>

146
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,860
these silly<font color="#CCCCCC"> states but what's</font>

147
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,919
interesting is it cuts one link and cuts

148
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other link and now comes the sexy</font>

149
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:12,880
part I can remember how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this on</font>

150
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:16,510
windows I can show it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you yes ooh but</font>

151
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:22,320
it changed scale this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> horrible</font>

152
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:26,670
oh it's had to shrink to fit on this

153
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:30,099
tube but anyway this is something that

154
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:32,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">the guys at University of Rome did this</font>

155
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,479
is the origin of the beacon you can now

156
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:37,689
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and turning on the announcement</font>

157
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:42,070
to 2914 this is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> route views data</font>

158
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:47,260
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> its tool homes 1239 and 2914 it</font>

159
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:53,050
just read withdrew from 2914 and so 2914

160
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:55,689
is getting it all from 1239<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and now</font>

161
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:58,540
it's cut 1239 and you're seeing

162
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:01,090
everybody lose their prefixes 2914 gave

163
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:07,300
up early now it starts announcing to

164
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:09,850
1239 again<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who do not</font>

165
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:18,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to continue to hear me talk go to</font>

166
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:20,350
BG play dot refuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> orc and you can play</font>

167
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:23,260
with this yourself give it any prefix

168
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:27,400
etc but so that's the routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> deacon</font>

169
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:30,240
making its<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcements ok and now I</font>

170
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,250
have to keep you more amused than this

171
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok that that's real runs off routing</font>

172
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:40,240
views data etc etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok um there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 14 ripe</font>

173
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:42,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">too so the packet stream sources for the</font>

174
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,590
experiment heading towards those beacons

175
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,630
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called planet labs now</font>

176
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,340
it's on research networks all over the

177
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,340
world and some commercial networks

178
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're about 370 nodes at about 155</font>

179
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,720
sides mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> toward Arnie network</font>

180
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,459
there's its URL but they're all these

181
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,950
hosts out there and you can conduct

182
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,860
distributed experiments so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

183
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:05,440
something running on many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those hosts</font>

184
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:09,790
and we switch with which hosts streaming

185
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,310
data towards the beacon and the beacon

186
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:14,680
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending it fixed intervals 50</font>

187
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,810
microseconds taking trace routes all the

188
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,800
normal measurement garbage what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

189
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,479
see here is a transition from providers

190
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,430
a and B and

191
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:34,139
link to a is cut here is the change in

192
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:38,319
delay for that source there is no change

193
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:41,230
boring well of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened was</font>

194
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,930
this provider preferred provider be in

195
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:49,089
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> place cut the link to provider</font>

196
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:52,138
a nothing changes half the world's

197
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:57,310
networks were unaffected by that cut

198
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:59,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we look at the other saw another</font>

199
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:03,010
case this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we're going to take the</font>

200
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:06,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">same node and we cut provider be and</font>

201
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:08,439
they have to switch providers and now we

202
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:12,550
saw some background delays happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

203
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:15,070
then we see this gap<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay where they've</font>

204
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:18,130
actually packets are being dropped you

205
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:22,120
can see the drops up here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we</font>

206
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:24,939
went<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that no drops two drops up the</font>

207
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:28,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">ying-yang and we can focus in on that</font>

208
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:30,819
and zoom it ok these are reorders by the

209
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,979
way there's no reordering we've got

210
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:34,689
drops um you can't see it well but

211
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,660
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> line here in a line here and</font>

212
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:42,370
we're measuring the length of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time there</font>

213
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:44,769
was packet drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and where we're</font>

214
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:49,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">going is we're going to look try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

215
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:56,459
a correlation<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the length of time</font>

216
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:59,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is packet drop and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp noise</font>

217
00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:02,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">people so because if you're looking at</font>

218
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:05,680
bgp noise and saying that says the

219
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:08,699
internet is sick<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be it</font>

220
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,649
should be correlated with packet drop

221
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:13,240
okay here's a more interesting case we

222
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:16,899
see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of these where there's</font>

223
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,569
islands of packets getting through in

224
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:21,970
the middle and we believe and we have

225
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:24,729
some evidence but not enough yet to show

226
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:27,850
that these are large intermediate a s is

227
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:32,850
converging and so the traffic gets there

228
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,850
by you know going around a side path

229
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:40,040
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of them together</font>

230
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:43,490
and there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some really anomalous ones</font>

231
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,260
right and some crazy ones so there's all

232
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,170
sorts of data everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't as clean</font>

233
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:50,450
is just those couple I've shown you

234
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,920
here's a zoom in on that garbage here's

235
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:57,500
just something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else thinks slow</font>

236
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:59,930
somebody's delay is sloping down for a

237
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,570
whole bunch of nodes<font color="#CCCCCC"> continually is</font>

238
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,729
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> better the event happens in here</font>

239
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,120
it affects this node not the rest of

240
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:11,210
them but it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to affect this mode to</font>

241
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">right which gets much noisier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

242
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:17,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've got all these graphs acted after</font>

243
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:20,239
day so unfortunately the projectors on

244
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,190
this side seems slightly skewed so you

245
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:28,340
can't see the left axis label that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

246
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:31,280
CDF of the packet loss and we see the

247
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:35,870
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp updates in blue the</font>

248
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:39,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">duration of loss in red and the amount</font>

249
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:46,580
the amount of time that bgp was talking

250
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:51,410
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in green and here we see that</font>

251
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:53,450
was in a transition from a B to a in

252
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:56,240
other words we cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> link be here is</font>

253
00:13:53,450 --> 00:14:01,370
cutting link a nothing very exciting

254
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:05,800
here is restoring a in other words only

255
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:08,390
be was connected now we connect up a and

256
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:13,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the total loss during all</font>

257

interesting beacon events<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay when we</font>

258
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:26,120
go to look and we show the duration of

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:30,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">bgp noise and the duration</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of packet</font>

loss it if we expected a correlation

261
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:36,380
we'd expect something that looked like a

line a<font color="#CCCCCC"> slope line in there we are not</font>

264
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:50,180
again lost during a single transition of

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:54,950
a b2b cutting link a<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay during all</font>

268
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:11,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay not very exciting now one warning</font>

269
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,980
is what we're trying to do is take the

270
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:14,480
same view of life that<font color="#CCCCCC"> andy and</font>

everybody else is taking which is

each of the source nodes is seeing and

00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,370
we're switching we're conducting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

276
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:30,920

277
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,260
general routing information but the same

278
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,839
thing everybody else is using so we're

279
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:38,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">just trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see if there if what the</font>

actual things that affect your customers

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:52,459
ok this is that kinky customer right

283
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:55,339
they cut their link to a and look at

284
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,410
what happens to them there we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

285
00:15:55,339 --> 00:16:00,880

planet labs know that's a Ron node the

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,320
MIT routing overlay experiment and I

288
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,750
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really routing overlays</font>

289
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,620
causing that that's a 30-second tick by

295
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:40,969

loss rates preferring is PB when we cut

297
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:49,200
the link to is PB for where they are in

298
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:52,980
the world so Australia

299
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:57,660
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally has this after you cut</font>

300
00:16:52,980 --> 00:17:01,340
out during the change after the change

301
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:05,579
it has that their loss rate improved

302
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:11,520
they normally preferred a lossy or

303
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:13,709
provider okay for everybody a number of

304
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:20,190
them look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> them they improve after the</font>

305
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:22,740
routing change right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do the same</font>

306
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:27,320
thing these in the sides preferring a be

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:30,210
a preferred<font color="#CCCCCC"> e after you restore be and</font>

308
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:33,120
these that guy gets worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys</font>

309
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:36,240
stay the same etc etc Russia of course

310
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:40,379
is you can tell there they've got

311
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:43,080
overloaded links<font color="#CCCCCC"> in congestion anything</font>

312
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,330
they respond to any change preferring

313
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">beyond the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transition to just be of</font>

314
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:53,669
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are better afterwards</font>

315
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:57,120
preferring be and restoring a etc etc

316
00:17:53,670 --> 00:18:01,730
all transitions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the correlation</font>

317
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:04,530
between loss rate and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s hop count</font>

318
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:09,390
ok this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> loss rate during the</font>

319
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:12,720
routing change and the hop count to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

320
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:16,800
stable path the preferred path and if

321
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,690
the hop count goes up you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect the</font>

322
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:24,270
loss rate to correlate you you're

323
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:27,810
looking for this you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sealing same</font>

324
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:30,270
between loss rate and how router hop

325
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,669
count as opposed to a s<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoptown that was</font>

326
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:37,350
a s opt out this is router hop count

327
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:40,419
seeing a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but that kind of</font>

328
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:42,969
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it okay</font>

329
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:45,700
so what this seems to say those last

330
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:48,879
couple is distant sites experience more

331
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:51,190
loss surprise there's a correlation

332
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:53,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">between a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sites routing preference and</font>

333
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,989
the type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition whether its</font>

334
00:18:53,470 --> 00:19:00,100
sights which prefer a have more loss

335
00:18:55,989 --> 00:19:02,379
rate during when a<font color="#CCCCCC"> is cut then when B is</font>

336
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:06,009
cut and the reverse is true brilliant

337
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:08,590
this is obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the correlation</font>

338
00:19:06,009 --> 00:19:13,029
between loss rate and ASM router hop

339
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:15,070
count is weak at best okay at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some site</font>

340
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:17,049
the loss rate during normal periods is

341
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:22,029
higher than that<font color="#CCCCCC"> during routing change</font>

342
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:29,470
periods<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe bgp MPG p noise improves</font>

343
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:33,609
delay don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> so huh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okeydoke some</font>
