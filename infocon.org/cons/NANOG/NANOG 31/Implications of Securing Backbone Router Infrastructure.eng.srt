1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,870
the next speaker will be talking about

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,679
the implications of securing backbone

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:13,410
infrastructure this is a topic that

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,929
we've known about a long time but it's

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:18,060
also a crucial topic as you see the

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,430
attacks in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet as we used to</font>

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,599
say with root and going up in there to

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:27,150
the right Ryan McDowell is from sprint

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,070
and I understand your masters and a

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,528
bachelors in<font color="#CCCCCC"> computer science and you've</font>

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,600
been working for sprint helping them get

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,600
this going for<font color="#E5E5E5"> about five years</font>

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,090
thank you so just kind of a talk to let

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,760
everybody know kind of what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

15
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:47,860
to help secure our backbone and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,860
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that impacts people so</font>

17
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,790
so the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we did started</font>

18
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,559
playing receive access lists on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco</font>

19
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,739
world or info filters on juniper world

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,590
back in about two thousand two we kind

21
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,360
of did things like the knife fragments

22
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">permit all our management type of stuff</font>

23
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,420
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH SNMP with secured with source</font>

24
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:13,650
and destination pairs permit<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp igp and</font>

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,900
a subset of ICMP permit you to key hi

26
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,950
ports for<font color="#CCCCCC"> trace route and then deny</font>

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,950
everything else in counting

28
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:28,539
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a graph showing kind of all</font>

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,229
the bad packets hitting the routers so

30
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:34,390
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a one-hour intervals of all the</font>

31
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:39,750
packets that we drop so you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

32
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:42,280
of play name that worm watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP back in</font>

33
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,600
September go through the roof so this is

34
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">the average number of packets hitting</font>

35
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,839
the router

36
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:53,619
this is a same thing but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the</font>

37
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:57,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of the worst router in the network</font>

38
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:58,539
same one hour interval the graphs kind

39
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:01,928
of line up very nicely they're a little

40
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:04,409
different and the scale is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to kind</font>

41
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:04,409
of through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roof</font>

42
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,410
just kind of how we put out receive

43
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:16,080
acl's on

44
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">find out that a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot less people run this</font>

45
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I actually thought so it's really</font>

46
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,400
pretty simple to do and it really helps

47
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,959
helps you out so basically just build

48
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,980
the basic access list even if you start

49
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,410
off as simple as permitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP UDP ICMP</font>

50
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,109
GRE whatever else use and then denying

51
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,570
all other IP protocols replace later

52
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,860
statements with permit and throw it out

53
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,890
there and look for matches where you

54
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,630
don't expect it we were surprised on how

55
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,630
much other stuff is going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router</font>

56
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:48,859
that we didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about block a</font>

57
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:51,420
lot of it and just constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> improve it</font>

58
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,640
tightened down here your IP addressing

59
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,079
admin source destination pairs cut your

60
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,079
port ranges down

61
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,780
and found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you really need a good IP</font>

62
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,599
addressing strategy to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it scalable</font>

63
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,190
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with our backbone space</font>

64
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,920
kind of numbered all over the place and

65
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,930
we had if we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do a</font>

66
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,549
good job we'd have like 100 line ACL

67
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,700
just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all so we did a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

68
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">work to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put all our loop backs into</font>

69
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:22,260
uniform ranges and then filter on that

70
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,690
so the end result is it made<font color="#E5E5E5"> our routers</font>

71
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,220
a whole lot harder to kill they're

72
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,980
really helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> with kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> magic</font>

73
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">packet attacks like the last two cisco</font>

74
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,880
hasn't any problem where one package

75
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">pushes the router and it's kind of fun</font>

76
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,060
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to block it in receive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ACL and not</font>

77
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,670
worry about reloading every writer in

78
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,709
the network because that's not fun we've

79
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,078
had very few operational implications of

80
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,940
deploying this the question we get the

81
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:46,560
most is your routers are broken because

82
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,769
I can't figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out her with a fragmented</font>

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,870
packet got a couple complaints when he

84
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:56,790
turned off at ntp but that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

85
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:58,890
about it so it's pretty low risk to do

86
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,439
one thing we found is change control can

87
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,670
be kind of difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this there</font>

88
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,370
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you want to have a separate</font>

89
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,189
receive a CL on every router it can be

90
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,480
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to automate and it's kind of</font>

91
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:12,840
scary to automate because if you break

92
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,760
it it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> your router out but um it</font>

93
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,798
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> out pretty well and the problem is</font>

94
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">you still have some open holes in it you</font>

95
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,979
can't close off 179 you can't close off

96
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:25,380
icmp there's still some UDP IP options

97
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:28,520
attacks so there's still it helps a lot

98
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,520
but it's not perfect

99
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,060
so what we said next is well most of the

100
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:37,060
attacks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw for actually to our</font>

101
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,860
customers routers so we would help

102
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,479
mitigate an attack do something and then

103
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,360
the attacker would take a step back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

104
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,758
take out the customers router so we said

105
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,680
well do we really need those IP

106
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,710
addresses routed there's really they

107
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really serve a purpose so let's</font>

108
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,930
stop routing the more specifics to those

109
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,930
/ 30s

110
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:07,420
so what we did is we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> route our</font>

111
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:11,620
aggregate blop and we advertise it via

112
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:16,330
BBB<font color="#CCCCCC"> tp2</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is PA up there so the best route</font>

113
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:18,850
to the / 24 becomes null 0 on all the

114
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:21,849
edge routers we don't redistribute

115
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:25,810
connected routes into bgp or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ibgp and we</font>

116
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:29,620
run next top cells so that one 9202 dot

117
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,270
4 / 30 is basically unreachable floors

118
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,220
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if that customer</font>

119
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:36,729
actually needs his dot 6 we just stick

120
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:39,720
in a static route to the / 32 so what

121
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that does for us is</font>

122
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,169
apologize miss

123
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:53,669
so from is PA you can't attack that

124
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">customers router</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore from my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spb you</font>

125
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:57,659
still can so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not perfect but um now</font>

126
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,100
the attackers not only have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

127
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,870
compromise a ton of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts they have to</font>

128
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,940
compromise them in the right location to

129
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,490
attack this the right person so it makes

130
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,760
their job a lot harder and the key is we

131
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:11,490
don't break things like you r PF so

132
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,190
things like MTU discovery or trace route

133
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,810
do not break so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still going to</font>

134
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,070
pass the RPF check because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

135
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,850
advertising the aggregate we're just not

136
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,849
carrying the more specific

137
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,190
so like I said it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> add a hundred</font>

138
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,740
percent of security but it makes the job

139
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,030
a whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> harder for the attacker and</font>

140
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,450
cat<font color="#CCCCCC"> and mouse game there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's one</font>

141
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">upping things right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

142
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,770
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty-five percent of our</font>

143
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,270
customers actually use the directly

144
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,150
connected interface on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router so</font>

145
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:44,640
that's a pretty small number or you know

146
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,799
quarter it did take us about over in a

147
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,599
year over a<font color="#E5E5E5"> year to to turn all our</font>

148
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,930
routers over it was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slow</font>

149
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,750
process very communication and intensive

150
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,890
with all the customers a lot of a lot of

151
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,840
folks didn't quite understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

152
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">were trying to do so just took a long</font>

153
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,179
time to answer all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the emails and</font>

154
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:05,910
communicate it well but the implications

155
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,580
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> traceroute is not broken but any</font>

156
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,740
packets to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router you can't really</font>

157
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">count on those working anymore so things</font>

158
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,750
like ping to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the router and everybody</font>

159
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:19,880
loves to ping the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers and trace</font>

160
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,880
route to the router is also impacted

161
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:25,159
so once we got that done we kind of

162
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:27,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">started thinking well what could we do</font>

163
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:29,899
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this thought came around well</font>

164
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:32,679
can we do the same thing in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> core and</font>

165
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:35,989
protect the actual core routers and

166
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:37,878
cisco has advertised passive only and

167
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:40,729
you can do it with the is is export

168
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:43,269
policies of juniper and what we you can

169
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:43,269
do is

170
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,500
same thing so we're basically going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

171
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,840
run

172

don't register be connected into bgp Ori

173
00:07:52,840 --> 00:08:00,760
GP run is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I as passive only so then what</font>

174
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:03,430
you achieve there is somebody up behind

175
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">is PA can't reach either of those two</font>

176
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,710
networks there somebody behind is<font color="#E5E5E5"> PB can</font>

177
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,890
still reach something that is directly

178
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:14,349
connected to but nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> further into</font>

179
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,060
the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then customer see can</font>

180
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,470
only reach things that he's directly

181
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,170
connected to and a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit further in</font>

182
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:22,300
so it kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> protects the core of the</font>

183
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">network from anybody attacking it you</font>

184
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,890
only can attack the router you're

185
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,370
directly connected to or one router

186
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,370
behind it

187
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:35,708
but the implications of that are a

188
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,109
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more intense because now no one</font>

189
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:40,029
can ping any of our routers or or

190
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,959
anything like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quite</font>

191
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:43,539
sure whether we're actually and go

192
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:47,439
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> with better yeah but um some</font>

193
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:50,470
other things used RC 1918 blue packs for

194
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:54,849
management start using all your SNMP all

195
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:57,540
your SSH ibgp doing that can really help

196
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,889
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> with receive a CLS because now if</font>

197
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,930
its private address space the odds of

198
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:04,569
somebody defaulting into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

199
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,670
and spoofing that your management

200
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:07,870
address is really really low so it makes

201
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,430
it almost impossible to reach in the

202
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,660
first place and anything that kind of

203
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,329
slips through the cracks you could pick

204
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,529
up with receive acl's and block it

205
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:16,779
there's some new features with receive

206
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:19,620
acl's like control<font color="#CCCCCC"> playing policing that</font>

207
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:23,500
are coming out even helped a little more

208
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:27,279
applying<font color="#CCCCCC"> BTS h or the GTS h3 receive a</font>

209
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:30,610
CL will help if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use RFC 1918 for</font>

210
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,220
your ibgp you're pretty much secured

211
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,019
with the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 1918 and you can</font>

212
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,209
block it in your receive a CLS and that

213
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:41,139
only kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of leaves bgb bgp as</font>

214
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:42,699
vulnerable and if you use bt<font color="#E5E5E5"> sh in your</font>

215
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:45,370
receive a sale you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stop that</font>

216
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:48,579
off off<font color="#E5E5E5"> the block there just by setting</font>

217
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:49,779
your TTL to like 254 and the way we're

218
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:52,209
thinking about initially deploying that

219
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:54,040
is you can receive a CL permit say

220
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:55,989
because it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a long time</font>

221
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,390
to convert to be TSH with everybody so

222
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:02,420
permit

223
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:04,970
say TTL is greater than 2 53 and then

224
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,219
less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not perfect but</font>

225
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:10,940
it'll it'll get you there until<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

226
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,440
convert everybody block IP options it's

227
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,870
another attack vector that can go

228
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,000
through the router we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> running no</font>

229
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,650
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> peace or out for ever and it's</font>

230
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,210
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you get a</font>

231
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,949
packet with option set you ignore them

232
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:25,900
and just forward it as if they weren't

233
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,900
set so

234
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,540
so what does all this mean it's

235
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically saying is don't plan on</font>

236
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,270
sending any packets destined<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

237
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:38,270
router that you're not directly

238
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,800
connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to but this is kind of already</font>

239
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,689
happening with the improvisation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

240
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,459
networks because all you're really

241
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:47,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">seeing is the first router in and the</font>

242
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:49,550
last router out it's much more secure

243
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,020
infrastructure it's not perfect but it's

244
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,839
a lot better than where most of us are

245
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,400
now and most importantly it can all be

246
00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:00,160
done without ingress filtering which is

247
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,160
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult so</font>

248
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,400
there's a couple references and any

249
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,400
questions

250
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:34,620
thanks thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much I guess</font>
