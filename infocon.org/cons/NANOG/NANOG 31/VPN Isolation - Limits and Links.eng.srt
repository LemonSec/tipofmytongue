00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,990
there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is to get input</font>

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,560
from the community on next bgp work<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:20,220

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:37,309
we're doing new standardization bgp work

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:41,370
we've been doing bgp work all along

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,770
that's what I'm we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

13

yaakov and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I are trying to take new work</font>

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,329
and the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group is trying to take</font>

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,070
new work in that order so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

16
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,800
about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> new work that's being</font>

17
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,890
proposed and voted on which are prefixed

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,099
limits multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP sessions avoid</font>

19
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,640
transition and we're all trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

20
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:10,830
more and better stable bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so why</font>

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,650
am i giving this work we need your input

22
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,250
we're at some decision points where even

23
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,530
the co-authors say well gee we'd really

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,350
like to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the eyes peas tell us what</font>

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,439
they need so<font color="#CCCCCC"> let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me start with what I'll</font>

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,140
call VPN isolation work items and by the

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my thanks to all the ISP people who</font>

28
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,439
talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me last time I can probably</font>

29
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:36,119
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask what's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing we</font>

30
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,579
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick up because we've got a lot</font>

31
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,460
of drafts and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things we could</font>

32
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,970
put in but if they're not useful today

33
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,649
tomorrow I got some prioritization

34
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,950
they're like toward the bottom of the

35
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,500
pile instead at the top so the first one

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,570
is a maximum prefix draft which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go</font>

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,540
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are two alternatives being</font>

38
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,329
presented warning here one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them is is</font>

39
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:04,740
a group that i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> working with which is</font>

40
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:06,839
Charlie hairs Marin Fang and the second

41
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,690
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> done by my good friends care</font>

42
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,340
Patel John Scudder and Chandra we've got

43
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,319
a real good discussion going on the list

44
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,740
if you've been listening on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye dr</font>

45
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,440
list

46
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,440
but we've decided we really really need

47
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,780
a nograkh the second one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a multi</font>

48
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,329
sessions attributes or multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCPS</font>

49
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,490
John Scudder and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chandra also came up</font>

50
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,230
with a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft it's been accepted and</font>

51
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,710
will be putting going forward in

52
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:35,280
standardization am I too loud right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

53
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:38,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and the last next one is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid</font>

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,710
transition how to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the BGP</font>

55
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:45,590
decision process and avoid swapping for

56
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,590
stupid reasons there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got my free</font>

57
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:51,570
unwanted stuff again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i apologize i just</font>

58
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,330
didn't take time to kill everything and

59
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,430
the last one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is soft notify now soft</font>

60
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,350
notify has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> rejected at this point</font>

61
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,020
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> far as there's not enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interest to</font>

62
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,989
go forward whether revisions of this

63
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,180
draft or pieces may go forward later<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

64
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to say that just the draft in</font>

65
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,490
its current form so again disclaimer I'm

66
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,000
a co-author on the maximum prefix draft

67
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:17,010
and I've asked some people to make to

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,610
keep me honest to make sure to complain

69
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:22,679
where I I don't and I'm using the best

70
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,720
my best understanding of the drafts and

71
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,360
again other draft authors should come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

72
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,420
and say things so first of all what's

73
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,210
our maximum prefix problem well today in

74
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,720
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding of ISPs and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it may be</font>

75
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:39,570
limited they set the maximum prefix

76
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,390
limit on a PE in a pece environment that

77
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:44,760
you see and the warning may be sent from

78
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,459
the PE to the providers network

79
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,399
management when the warning<font color="#E5E5E5"> thresher is</font>

80
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:53,040
triggered now these are configurated

81
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,740
triggers triggers that say ah you're

82
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,470
within ten percent of running out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

83
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,960
limit at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point the session will</font>

84
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:05,190
either be dropped by a PE when you hit a

85
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:08,430
magic prefix limit or the routes will be

86
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,280
silently dropped as a result my

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">understanding from the service providers</font>

88

two<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of failures behind this</font>

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:32,150
just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little over the limit I had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2000</font>

94
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:35,419
as my limit and I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 2002 ooh that</font>

95
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:38,120
hurt the second is and I hear this

96
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:40,219
occurs regularly somebody drops a full

97
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,530
routing table down the wrong pipe and

98
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:46,580
suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have lots and lots of bad</font>

99
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:49,400
rounds that's a real problem now the

100
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:52,609
issues about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it are you get a customer</font>

101
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:56,710
service interruption you have complexity

102
00:04:52,610 --> 00:05:00,260
and you get possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> finger-pointing</font>

103
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:03,049
okay how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with it today well</font>

104
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:06,080
you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not use the prefix limit</font>

105
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,760
and have infinite source but some people

106
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,020
really want to have lots and lots of

107
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,909
epns on a single box for a to make the

108
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,760
business balance so they need the prefix

109
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:19,010
limit is there something that would make

110
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">the customers life easier and again now</font>

111
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:24,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going to put on my co-author hat</font>

112
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:27,320
base my co-authors who are service

113
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:29,030
provider said I want three limits I want

114
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,830
a warning limit you know that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

115
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,929
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a case where I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to</font>

116
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:37,099
have a fire drill I get one to two weeks

117
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:39,620
to say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I got a creeping address</font>

118
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,680
problem and i can go fix my limits at

119
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,870
that point the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh step back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

120
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,390
some people were all talking in the

121
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:50,810
maximum prefix draft about negotiated

122
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:53,360
limits the discussion has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been lively</font>

123
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:56,539
the first question I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a few</font>

124
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,020
minutes has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been no Lytton negotiation</font>

125
00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:01,700
on limits so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go on to that in a</font>

126
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,310
moment but I do want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the</font>

127
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,229
option is you know none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this should</font>

128
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,720
be in BGP protocol it should all be in

129
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:10,310
configuration but I want to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and</font>

130
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,340
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about these limits and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

131
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:16,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mechanisms the second is ignore</font>

132
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,830
the prefix mostly that's the silent drop

133
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,080
right now okay to give a limit at a

134
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,300
certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> point on the NOC pieces and the</font>

135
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,909
last is drop the connection and this is

136
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:29,570
mostly targeted from what I understand

137
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:31,880
of the to catch the erroneous blaster

138
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:36,110
routes and get it stopped because it

139
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:39,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens so frequently so we need input</font>

140
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,610
you know from service providers

141
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:44,460
is this useful for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network is it</font>

142
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,660
crucial do we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> signal limits or</font>

143
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,940
do you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue with</font>

144
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,090
configuration these service providers

145
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:53,460
that I've was co-authoring with said I

146
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:56,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">really would like to signal this in BGP</font>

147
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,349
to the remote side and negotiate it as

148
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,620
well as have it configured because

149
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:04,199
obviously the changes would happen based

150
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,260
on the not changing something based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

151
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:08,880
configuration and do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

152
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,940
suggestion of using this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would break</font>

153
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,919
your network and that's true of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

154
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:18,960
these drafts I should take a step back

155
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,760
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the maximum prefix draft do you want</font>

156
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">three limits do you think one sufficient</font>

157
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:27,180
do you want no negotiation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the drop</font>

158
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:31,110
limit and the warning limit can be done

159
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:37,100
locally in the other draft in in the

160
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:40,139
first in the draft by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Patel Scudder and</font>

161
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:45,600
upon I did I give I killed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chandra</font>

162
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:49,020
I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's look drop into</font>

163
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,850
mechanisms<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

164
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,930
mechanisms and how they might actually

165
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:57,720
end up the two drafts<font color="#E5E5E5"> one specifies ORF</font>

166
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,120
which will allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set the limit</font>

167
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,970
based on a particular prefix and of

168
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,729
course 0 / 0 could be all prefixes you

169
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,650
could have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of thing so once</font>

170
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:11,250
you get there then it's the encoding of

171
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:13,770
two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of mechanisms inside</font>

172
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,410
bgp you have the route refresh mechanism

173
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:18,900
and you have the dynamic capabilities

174
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,729
mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think as you go through the</font>

175
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,400
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the mechanisms you'll recognize</font>

176
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:26,639
them from existing drafts where you have

177
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:29,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the dynamic capabilities the action</font>

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,620
the code<font color="#E5E5E5"> that capability length to type</font>

179
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,740
the type of caps in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the route refresh</font>

180
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,589
you of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> safi when is the route</font>

181
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:41,219
refresh enacted is it deferred or is it

182
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:43,589
immediate and the RF type in in the base

183
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,360
form if we just have one limit you'll

184
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,640
see that there are two different forms

185
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the same thing a prefixed limit for</font>

186
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:56,470
everything of about four<font color="#E5E5E5"> bytes</font>

187
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:59,560
the s in the dynamic capabilities or

188
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:03,660
draft is does this stop or does this go

189
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:06,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">on but if you add the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three limits okay</font>

190
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:10,329
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually we had two different</font>

encoding zuv these the dash<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 0 encoding</font>

192
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:17,140
which had a bit flag and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then someone</font>

193
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:19,599
asked us to try the<font color="#CCCCCC"> four vital line</font>

194
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,330
version so in that you would have the

195
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,350
four types of limits so in that case<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

196
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:28,480
mechanism very simply by the limits<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

197
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,300
what about operations on these maximum

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,730
prefix limits in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one that has</font>

199
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,890
dynamic capabilities you first negotiate

200
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,770
the limits in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open and then you can</font>

201
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:41,110
renegotiate the limits with the dynamic

202
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:43,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">capabilities you have in the dynamic</font>

203
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,670
capabilities you send the dynamic packet

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,070
the action and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prefix and the other</font>

205
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,829
side can also send it one thing I do

206
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,530
note is in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dynamic capabilities we</font>

207
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,490
may have an issue in the dynamic

00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">capabilities really doesn't have an</font>

210
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:01,120
to have that that might be an

211
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:03,370
enhancement to dynamic capabilities

212
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,190
there are some known other issues

213
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:09,850
concerning dynamic capabilities whether

214
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:11,740
you can do it in other forms in it again

215
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,990
missing this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sent you</font>

216
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:17,890
dynamic capabilities tell me you got it

217
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:19,450
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the maximum prefix versus</font>

218
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,610
route refresh you will have route

219
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:25,210
refresh with defer it will just send the

220
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:27,220
other piece route refresh with immediate

221
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:30,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">will ask for the route refresh and fro</font>

222
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:34,150
back now there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some cases in here</font>

223
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:37,990
where I don't I think I'll stop at that

224
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:39,699
point and go<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward so one thing we</font>

225
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,460
really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear from service</font>

226
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,930
providers is do you want just configured

227
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,940
limits because there are a group of

228
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who say well configured limits</font>

229
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,020
are really what we want forget the

230
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,800
signaling why do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need signaling</font>

231
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:55,390
you're going to configure it either way

232
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,280
service providers said that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great but</font>

233
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,199
it's like a belt and suspenders I'd like

234
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,930
to have the configured limits I'd like

235
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,889
to also tell the remote side that I'd

236
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,809
have the

237
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:06,910
configured limits and let them<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and</font>

238
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:11,079
when I renegotiated I'd like to tell

239
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:15,279
them I now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a chair set this</font>

240
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:17,858
is a co-authors moment I note the one

241
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gave credence to this is the</font>

242
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:22,989
statistics from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> yankee group and the</font>

243
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:24,850
info<font color="#E5E5E5"> attics on how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many outages and how</font>

244
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:28,419
much time is based on configuration

245
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,739
errors i denote also from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick's talk we</font>

246
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:31,540
have a significant amount of

247
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:34,029
configuration errors so when these

248
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,608
service providers I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to said</font>

249
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:39,129
oh gee I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that checks my</font>

250
00:11:36,609 --> 00:11:41,499
configuration they said I can sort of

251
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:43,329
see that you know configurations aren't

252
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:45,429
perfect it doesn't mean they're not a

253
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:47,258
good service provider in fact I think

254
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:49,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's because these guys are trying to be</font>

255
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:51,339
proactive really really focused

256
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:52,809
engineers because they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

257
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:54,699
wait for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer they're trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

258
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:57,160
be proactive they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on</font>

259
00:11:54,699 --> 00:12:01,059
this the second was you'd rather have

260
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,759
this on our or<font color="#CCCCCC"> RF basis or dynamic</font>

261
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:08,738
capabilities that's a mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

262
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:10,540
and I laud the other co-authors drafts

263
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:12,429
it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good draft to think</font>

264
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,439
through things<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there's more details</font>

265
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:17,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the draft but this is the question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

266
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:20,709
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real point is do you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

267
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:22,449
mechanism and then we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss do you</font>

268
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:24,429
want these three limits do you want one

269
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:26,829
limit do you want none of this would

270
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:28,839
really like to have input we'd like to

271
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:32,399
also have input if you have preferences

272
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:35,799
between ORF and dynamic capabilities

273
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,540
okay that's the major that's one big

274
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,699
piece now let me go on to the multi

275
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,790
session this has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> accepted as a work</font>

276
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:45,669
item and today we run different a few

277
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,709
Saffy's over different sessions but we

278
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:50,410
do that today with multiple effects and

279
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:52,329
lots of configuration but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

280
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:55,389
we'd like to do this with a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

281
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:58,419
more mechanism and a lot and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as much</font>

282
00:12:55,389 --> 00:13:00,789
configuration so we want one<font color="#CCCCCC"> pass appear</font>

283
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:02,679
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to remote peers fe Saffy's and</font>

284
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:05,350
pick one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's a</font>

285
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:07,959
multi-session capability a jeep it to

286
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:10,689
pick the group there's also three new

287
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:12,699

let's just stop you know if there's a

the complete route selection and they're

00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,600
both valid and you're going to swap
