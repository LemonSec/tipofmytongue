also seeing increased competition and

within a given metro area you quite

56
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,419
often get multiple exchanges we may have

57
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,060
as many as six or seven depending on how

perspective while layered into to

minimal active components in general

162
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,590
what it means is you can run a wire<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a</font>

what as a cheap interconnector or what

provisionally exercises where there's

means the

235
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:54,830
um you have these<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-pressure hoses</font>

which can leak anywhere I normal even

254
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,280
some people attempt that but more

you don't know what's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other end</font>

00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:47,650
that stuff may come back at you all of

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">this makes the thing much less scalable</font>

260
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:53,120
so I've talked about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the general</font>

261
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,350
issues some of the general experiences

some of the general principles behind

263
00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:00,530
this how did this work in practice when

264
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,990
we went into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> practice of connecting</font>

266
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,280
basically we very much click the view

267
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,099
that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a risky thing to do what</font>

268
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,750
their advantages so let's try and be as

269
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,290
careful as possible and do this right

270
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:17,450
arm we're both london-based exchange

271
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,250
operators we have rather diverse

272
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,370
approaches to what we do the markets

273
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,110
that we sell to are not the same but

274
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're overlapping the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> single biggest</font>

275
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,050
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have in common is we're</font>

276
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,380
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the biggest internet exchange in</font>

277
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,910
london arm and we've basically been

278
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,540
cooperating an informal basis for a

279
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,829
couple of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> now after some pilot</font>

00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:50,240

resourcing is very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a volunteer</font>

best internet volunteer effort tradition

00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:34,180
and that's to provide peering as a best

00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">is this coterminous principle which is</font>

314
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,790
we're also doing similar things in other

315
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,380
metros in Europe the important<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

316
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,760
though is that we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> connecting</font>

317
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,560
these metals together we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have a</font>

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:13,480
pan-european exchange point we have

319
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:18,160
multiple basically identical internet

320
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,690
exchanges in multiple locations when we

321
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,430
looked into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we basically identified</font>

322
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,610
a number of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> models for</font>

323
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:25,630
connecting the two exchanges together

324
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,640
there's a bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> detail in these and</font>

325
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,080
some talks are given previously but

326
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,939
essentially we thought there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was two</font>

327
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,790
important models to consider private

328
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:36,280
peering and<font color="#E5E5E5"> share public hearing and</font>

329
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,839
what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we did the first and then</font>

330
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,360
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second and then we thought we'll</font>

331
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,950
explore<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other ones and future this</font>

332
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">is mainly to minimize the operational</font>

333
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,860
risks we've got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> private peering model</font>

334
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,319
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be much less risky than doing the</font>

335
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:51,190
public but it was all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> confidence</font>

336
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,750
building exercise as i said like ISPs

337
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:55,030
the internet exchanges compete with each

338
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,040
other now but there's also need to turn

339
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,810
to connect and it was important to build

340
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,069
confidence between the two organizations

341
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:04,900
that we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not harm our own</font>

342
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:06,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations by doing this you'll see</font>

343
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:11,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the next diagram that diagrams are</font>

344
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,640
not my strong point but essentially

345
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:17,730
this this briefly shows the two internet

346
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,819
exchanges a point-to-point VLAN between

347
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:22,950
them the VLAN basically is on four ports

348
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:26,900
the two participants ports that need to

349
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:28,740
connect and on the internet link and

350
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:32,810
basically you have a very simple

351
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,810
point-to-point virtual connection there

352
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,340
next picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> shows the second mode of</font>

353
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,689
public peering and the idea there is

354
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:42,210
that you have a VLAN which is

355
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,610
effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shared logical exchange</font>

356
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:48,330
that exists across the two underlying

357
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:50,340
exchanges in general people don't take

358
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,920
extra ports to do this in general<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

them to opt into multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans on the</font>

got to was this so far on the

thought to the commercial model in this

420
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:16,060
and really we tried to keep it as

similar to enter<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP sender keeps all</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">customers we charge extra for extra VLAN</font>

438
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,870
assignments but the basic principle was

439
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,020
to preserve the autonomy of both

440
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:04,240
operators but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep it simple we have</font>

441
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,369
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about other commercial models</font>

442
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,020
particularly where the exchange we might

443
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:09,489
be connecting to is also commercial one

444
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,859
you can do things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like revenue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sharing</font>

445
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,940
or resale arrangements but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they weren't</font>

446
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,439
appropriate for the particular

447
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:18,550
relationship to exchange point and line

448
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:22,959
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> resilience in practice as I said</font>

449
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:24,520

450
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,290
terms of multiple spanning three domains

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,240
equal to 1 s may change this in future

452
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:30,010
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not a standard that's widely</font>

don't rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on fancy complicated stuff</font>

between the two to make your connection

that all traffic must be explicitly VLAN

could be on a paranoid basis not just

pulling the plug in the whole thing

487
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,870
service levels have talked a little bit

agreement which basically documents all

499
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,000
the above is in the public domain we

500
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,950
also added a schedule which basically

501
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,240
said that which visitors<font color="#CCCCCC"> got all the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">nitty-gritty details</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that could change</font>

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,160
include things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like escalation points</font>

522
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,270
months we will conduct a review and

523
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,530
basically decided to continue the

524
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:20,170
agreement depending on traffic levels

525
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:21,490
there's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> collector Reuters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

527
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,670
because there's one on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> line outside</font>

528
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,899
we have plans to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put one on the exchange</font>

529
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:28,150
website as well basically just so that

530
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:33,370
we can see what routes are available at

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:35,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the young by the shared public what are</font>

532
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,959

<font color="#E5E5E5">broadcast storms can get through in</font>

recent incident what happened was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,270
people who came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to both exchanges were</font>

539

00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">increasing practice that people use the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that was too bad the done thing that</font>

makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> things significantly worse we</font>

545
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,810
haven't quite figured out how to

546
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,700
maintain a mailing list that is updated

547
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">one half of participants on each side</font>

548
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,720
locally but can we also posted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy</font>

549
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:14,290
the side I'm sure that's not hard

550
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,110
problem to solve um some switch vendors

551
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:19,450
use VLAN 1 as the default VLAN for

552
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,310
carrying bpdus in this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

553
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,260
difficult on cisco switches because you

554
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,840
can't turn that off the line<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 is on</font>

555
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,860
every port you can disable that we

556
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,320
didn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a problem with</font>

557
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,120
extreme switches until we found until we

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,770
switched 8021<font color="#CCCCCC"> w and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found that we</font>

were forced to use VLAN 1 as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

560
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:41,110
another interconnect mode that we've

561
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:42,640
looked at is extending the reach of one

564
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:48,610
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also an interesting question why</font>

565
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,710
should an ISP who is connected to both

566
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,790
exchanges continue to connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to both</font>

00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,980
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can save my neighbor on the</font>

568
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:56,139
connecting to one really the best answer

569
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:59,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have for that is the on the the</font>

570
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,490
service level points that I made before

571
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:05,510
one or two observations there was we

572
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,250
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much needed a champion of this in</font>

573
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:09,620
each organization there was quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:12,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">of resistance and suspicion and that</font>

575
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,419
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about from a commercial</font>

576
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,860
bottom line point of view all these guys

577
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,320
take our business away will we lose

578
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,820
revenue it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was also about on the</font>

membership organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> side well</font>

580
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:25,520
exactly why are these commercial guys

581
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:27,740
doing this um I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that we start with</font>

582
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,300

00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:11,549
practice is how do you tell what the

727
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:13,350
customers actually got connected arm you

728
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:14,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">can have a box connected to your</font>

729
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,969
exchange which is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rotor</font>

730
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,400
which happens to be bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

731
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:22,320
connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> from another participant arm</font>

732
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,700
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were thinking of</font>

733
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,399
implementing that wasn't a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shoot</font>

734
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,929
first ask questions later basis which is

735
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in the conventional</font>

736
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:31,409
public exchange you see something

737
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,179
injecting bpdus or odd we were broadcast

738
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:37,950
traffic you give them a call you say can

739
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:41,279
you fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> this maybe with a VLAN which was</font>

740
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:43,710
dedicated to non-native<font color="#E5E5E5"> router</font>

741
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,149
connections if you saw any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff</font>

742
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,909
the default we were to be shut it down

743
00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:50,178
because effectively by opting anybody

744
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:53,129
into that you would be on the basis of

745
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:56,610
there's a strict much stricter set of

746
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:58,969
rules for joining this club so yes it's

747
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,439
something we're thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I</font>

748
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">hadn't had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of feedback from ISPs</font>

749
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,980
and whether they'd be interested in that

750
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,830
or not I'd said interested to hear it

751
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:11,549
but what started the conversation was

752
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:13,379
that ISPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said well i mean i would say</font>

753
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:15,539
a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> subset of them had certain</font>

754
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:18,869
performance expectations from their

755
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:21,450
peers yeah and we're seeing different

756
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:23,999
results I don't know how important these

757
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,980
results were interconnecting or

758
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:28,799
appearing with someone who was<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a</font>

759
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,539
distance<font color="#CCCCCC"> pairing connection and so in</font>

760
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,759
order to maintain a sort of set level

761
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:35,070
expectations<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had the idea was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

762
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:36,539
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one VLAN work it was pretty you</font>

763
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,820
know standard in another VLAN where

764
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:40,529
anything goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly if we</font>

765
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,869
implemented that we'd offer a higher SLA

766
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:44,700
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vietnam so I suspect that</font>

767
00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:45,990
separate infrastructure dedicated

768
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,279
infrastructure for that is probably not

769
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:53,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost-effective thanks will be the last</font>

770
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:57,210
question hey Brian Dixon um just to

771
00:29:53,970 --> 00:30:00,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually follow up on this idea using</font>

772
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:03,450
the analogy of power distribution of AMD

773
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:06,959
feeds of power an enemy<font color="#E5E5E5"> VLAN and then</font>

774
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:09,029
for the inter inter switch stuff when

775
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,220
you have the redundant facilities having

776
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:13,590
the a over<font color="#CCCCCC"> one redundant facility in the</font>

777
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">be over the other redundant facility and</font>

778
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,949
you distribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> all those be lanced all</font>

779
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:18,509
your switches internally I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

780
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,909
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually accomplish a lot of very</font>

781
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:24,049
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and times I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting the</font>

782
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:24,049
resilience requirement yeah

783
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,180
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font>
