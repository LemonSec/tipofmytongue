so who am i what have I done back in the

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,700
mid-90s I did some work with the FCC

31
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,470
providers shortly after that that

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,900
basically that was a time in which

33
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,110
foreign foreign telcos that would come

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,840
ISPs we're seeking legal redress from

35
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:34,590
what they perceive to be the excessive

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,520
market power of us-based international

37
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,090
telcos come ISPs so maybe that begs a

38
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,210
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> am I in the wrong conference I</font>

39
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:48,180
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it seems to me that both</font>

40
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,070
of these events most of both of these

41
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,909
transitions had ultimately had very

42
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,520
significant impact on what you do here

43
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:00,479
in this room I imagine many of you

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,179
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 97 when the similar kind of a</font>

48
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,990
appearing by about six months and

00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:15,450
following the failure of

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:23,400
bodies from what they perceived to be US

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,100
market power they began taking a market

54
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,140
solution and buying up some us-based

55
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,019
ISPs and entrepreneurial cable systems

56
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,709
so i would say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there continues to</font>

57
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,630
be a really strong tie between

the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is ultimately</font>

00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,780
older version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk</font>

75
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:35,549
things okay anyway so here's a

76
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,860
provocation widely perceived a commonly

77
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:40,770
noted fact autonomous systems are merely

78
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,370
an implementation detail of inter domain

79
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:47,010
routing so it begs the question to my

80
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind what is inter domain routing and</font>

81
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:56,280
inflammation detail of actually this is

82
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,350
very radically different you think he's

83
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,100
saying these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are his current slide this</font>

84
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:07,290
is this is the version that that that i

85
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:11,340
sent a week ago I apologize yeah I do

86
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:13,670
excuse me it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going along smoothly</font>

87
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,670
here

88
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:20,070
I know

89
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,100
Oh

90
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:34,289
thanks

91
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,199
so you got some spare time now you're

92
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:44,199
happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

93
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,840
right

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,930
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the delay</font>

95
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok Susan says does the correct slide set</font>

96
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,960
is on the web

97
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,520
okay what's more with conviction

98
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I think we're gonna have to live</font>

well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay enough to leg anyway to</font>

continue okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> if if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a climate systems</font>

103
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,710
are merely an inflammation detail of

inter domain routing what is what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

significance of inter domain routing

itself that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a preamble when we go</font>

107
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,130
back to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of basic propositions that</font>

108
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,159
I want to pose to you all and tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

109
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,690
what I'm thinking that is this wrong

110
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,530
many of the baits that that I'm involved

111
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:29,150
in and that I hear about rarely that are

112
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,250
relevant<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet governance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and control</font>

113
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,750
costs around issues that you might

114
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,930
describe in terms of eyeballs and

115

118
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,330
related issues I would submit that this

119
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:50,150
is in essence what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the digital divide</font>

120
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:52,370
debate is all about so another reaching

121
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,429
eyeballs in content or access and

122
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:58,490
services resolve to public IP addresses

123
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,400
thanks to semantic overloading which is

124
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,780
the source of concern in other areas

125
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,409
they're measurable on a comparative if

126
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:08,000
not absolute basis by means of public IP

127
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,550
obviously there are lots of caveats that

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll talk about towards the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

129
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:14,900
presentation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> concept of</font>

130
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,370
address planning management assumes some

131
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,280
sane relationship between address needs

132
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,260
and address allocations and I think for

133
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,210
people who are familiar with the dress

134
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,130
planning and management that it's

135
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,950
possible to reverse engineer some sense

136
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:32,860
from the the routed IP that's out there

137
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:35,840
based on that knowledge so another

138
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,060
provocation perhaps today the eyeballs

139
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,890
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that equation is fundamentally</font>

140
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:44,120
dependent on basic telecom last mile and

141
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:46,930
this component of the equation is

142
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,760
measurable in terms of d/s zeros<font color="#CCCCCC"> dsos</font>

143
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,650
which are reported growth which is

144
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,880
reported<font color="#CCCCCC"> by telcos annually to the itu</font>

145
00:07:51,650 --> 00:08:00,870
this is a good record of basic telecom

146
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:05,200
growth stretching back decades there's a

147
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:07,510
cable / represents a small deviation<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

148
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:12,460
this but I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say it's so pretty</font>

149
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:14,140
small so applying the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same rules of</font>

thumb used to request and implement IP

00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,950

general sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope of national</font>

network development in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact what I'm</font>

154
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,070
suggesting is what if you own the

155
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,900
country and what if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were the address</font>

156
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,790
planner for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> country what would you</font>

157
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,150
be what would you be doing to try to

158
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:34,419
provision for that and just starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

159
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,130
reach for some basic rules<font color="#CCCCCC"> of from ideas</font>

160
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:40,120
about how you might go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through that</font>

161
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,860
process so I Bala some content peak

162
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,380
simultaneous users<font color="#CCCCCC"> plus locally hosted</font>

163
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,100
content plus foreign customers and

164
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:51,790
content since autonomous systems are not

165
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:53,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Geographic and a visible factor would be</font>

166
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the local customers content of</font>

167
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:01,120

00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:03,850
measured in in this in his term so what

169

am I mean by nationality on layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

170

might think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is probably not a not</font>

171
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,700
controversial this is sort of the same

172
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,640
metrics that have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> used by kada</font>

207

so would that make a difference in what

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:49,570
of similar size<font color="#CCCCCC"> smith was writing at a</font>

of aggressive international expansion

called mercantilism in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> smith's</font>

277
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:21,160
argument was that mercantilism hurted

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,970
hoping to do is in effect to test the

281

00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:41,809
could be interesting source of it

452
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,220
basically can only be inferred

453
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:48,879
indirectly but I think basically you can

454
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,200
I think you can infer them indirectly

455
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,230
from some of the other patterns that I'm

456
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,200
examining multi ASO Thomas routing

multi asar DS are all associated with

463
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,678
the same country I think British Telecom

464
00:23:12,549 --> 00:23:19,899
is one significant exception but I

465
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:21,309
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> found any others yet again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

466
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,149
would that would beg some questions

in most countries there several so again

472
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,149
it's a it's a question of relative

473
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:40,029
differences rather than absolute but if

474
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:42,340
it becomes if if I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tweak things</font>

independently operated if that makes a

485

it basically the there'll be no evidence

487
