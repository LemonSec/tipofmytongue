hi good<font color="#CCCCCC"> morning everybody let me know if</font>

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,580
so I'm bretzel Mahajan and I'm going to

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,239
that are based on the state of my

17

network without knowing what's happening

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,339
in the other networks and some of the

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,890
bad effects Randy talked about at a

situation in particular you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can identify</font>

22
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:57,870
three undesirable consequences of this

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,580
even when they are better paths present

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,979
in the network the other being in

27
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,670
stability and oscillations something

28
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,229
when bgp does not converge or because

29
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,540
local decisions are being made without

30
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,729

33
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,408
of slides but there's an even bigger

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,049
cost which is the cost of managing these

35
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,090
networks is high just because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,460
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> local decisions without any sort</font>

38
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,240

40

41
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,649
towards some other direction so<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font>

42
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,810
a simple example of poor performance

43
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,909
just consider a simple case<font color="#E5E5E5"> of two isps</font>

44
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,530
those three links in the middle are

45
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,540
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> peering links between those</font>

46
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,000
two isps and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

47
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,969
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> two floors 11 of the flow is going</font>

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,210
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> is PA in that dot to is PB and the</font>

49
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:02,850
flow back so what happens when is PA

50
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,850
wants to send traffic to is PB it picks

51
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,740
what it calls the earliest exit since is

52
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,288
PA does not know where the traffic is

53
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,019
headed inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> RSPB the best it can do is</font>

54
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,880
to optimize

55
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,040
cost of<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrying traffic within its own</font>

56
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,470
network and hence pick the early exit or

57
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,470
hot basically what we call hot potato

58
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,940
routing purely in terms of the path

59
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,190
length this path would have been better

60
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,960
but is PA cannot do that because it

61
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic is headed</font>

62
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,170
to within is PB and also the fact that

63
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,970
this path is much cheaper for<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes PA so</font>

64
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,339
it's taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> a locally optimal decision</font>

65
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:40,340
but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens on</font>

66
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,560
the reverse flow is<font color="#E5E5E5"> PB takes a similar</font>

67
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,390
decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> of early exit and we end up</font>

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,610
with both high speeds taking early<font color="#E5E5E5"> exit</font>

69
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:49,100
and the net cost now for both high

70
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,380
speeds not just for is PA is much higher

71
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,150
compared to this particular what you

72
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,370
might call an optimal from a path length

73
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,410
perspective system that both high speeds

74
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,000
using the middle peering link and doing

75
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,770
that so the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about the</font>

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,960
solution is it's cheaper for both

77
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,680
highest<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece and also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end-to-end path</font>

78
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,360
length is shorter and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is there</font>

79
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,970
is no currently currently there is no

80
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,220
mechanism and bgp to let you do that you

81
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,440
could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> meds but meds basically means</font>

82
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of the upstream eyes we</font>

83
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,890
choose is how the traffic goes the

84
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,650
downstream eyes we choose is what you go

85
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,660
so in this case so if both high speeds

86
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,550
were using meds we just get the reverse

87
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,799
of hot potato rodding where the traffic

88
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:31,250
flows in<font color="#CCCCCC"> reverse with no reduction in</font>

89
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,780
path length whatsoever so that was an

90
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,970
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of poor performance and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

91
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,610
said it can lead to instability or

92
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,260
oscillations in certain cases so here's

93
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,540
an interesting example of that again

94
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">considered to isps with three peering</font>

95
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,410
links between each other and we're going

96
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,880
to talk about two floors going in that

97
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,640
direction the orange flow and the blue

98
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,130
flow and assume we're what happens when

99
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,070
the peering link between the two isp

100
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:57,230
fails now is PA is forced to read out

101
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,660
this traffic so what it does it looks at

102
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,220
the state of its own network and say

103
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to choose the bottom</font>

104
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:07,580
peering link for both of those flows so

105
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,530
what happens as a result of which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is PA</font>

106
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,860
is actually not aware of this causes an

107
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:15,110
overload inside is PB and what B does an

108
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,520
operator on the B side comes along one

109
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,320
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the links inside my network is</font>

110
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,029
overloaded let me shift some traffic

111
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,250
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom peering link to the top</font>

112
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">pairing link using some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp mechanism</font>

113
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,300
either prepending

114
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:31,440
our local in our local prayers so it

115
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,300
does that but what this does now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> PB</font>

116
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,219
has taken a locally optimal decision and

117
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,800
moving the traffic upwards but this

118
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,770
cause is an overload inside is<font color="#E5E5E5"> PA so</font>

119
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,050
what it does a comes along and moves the

120
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,820
traffic right back or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something similar</font>

121
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,530
that goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same path well be</font>

122
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,780
notices this stage moves it right back

123
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,460
and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> making any of this up this</font>

124
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,320
was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> an incident that happened</font>

125
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,719
between two big eyes peas<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was told and</font>

126
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,190
this went on for two days operators on

127
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,080
both sides were changing the routing

128
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,850
configuration every 30 minutes or so and

129
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,889
at the end of two days they realize that

130
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">what was actually going on that both</font>

131
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:05,820
operators were undoing each other's work

132
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,110
and if they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually talking to</font>

solutions in the system that do exist

00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:13,530
where no oscillations happen and you can

136
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,669
come to rotting both flows in a manner

137
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:20,130
which is acceptable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> both ISPs here so</font>

you haven't adversely impacted anybody

150
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,859
now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess works only for those of</font>

151
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:52,320
us who are religious and for rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

152
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:54,000
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just fails so what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do next is</font>

153
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,620
you can do something better the problem

154
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,360
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can praise you might not</font>

155
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,010
observe the problem in your own network

156
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,599
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there might be a problem in somebody</font>

157
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:04,050
else's network and that other operator

158
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:06,539
is now racing against time and firing to

159
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,220
understand what went on so to remedy

160
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:10,500
that what you can do is call ahead if

161
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">you wanted to make some change in your</font>

162
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,220
own network and if you know it would

163
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,020
adversely impact some<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

164
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,960
neighbor you call them okay i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

165
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,820
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 o clock tonight so this</font>

166
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,770
way at least even if it causes problems

167
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,150
inside their networks they know what the

168
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,889
cause of the problem is and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll give</font>

169
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,080
you a call so what now what you do is

170
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:29,760
you call ahead make changes and hope

171
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a call from your</font>

172
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,210
neighboring RSP because if you do you

173
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,359
make another change and start hoping

174
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,919
again

175
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,589
so better way out of this dilemma of

176
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:41,539
making chain making changes basically

177
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:43,520
based on just local information is to

178
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:45,378
basically call the operator and manually

179
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,719
negotiate a set of mutually agreeable

180
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:49,099
solution you know you talk you talk to

181
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:50,899
the other guy on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone and say okay</font>

182
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:52,248
this is the situation these are the set

183
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:53,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">of flows I want to read out but these</font>

184
00:06:52,249 --> 00:06:55,969
are the changes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to make is this</font>

185
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:57,529
okay with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the cost of this</font>

186
00:06:55,969 --> 00:06:58,610
solution while it works and it's

187
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:00,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably better than the other two</font>

188
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,599
options<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost of this solution is</font>

189
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:03,919
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the human coordination time which</font>

190
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:06,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes it very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> expensive and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

191
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably not practice often unless it's</font>

192
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:11,419
unless the change is really major so

193
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,188
here's the challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us can we</font>

194
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:15,378
automate this intro eyes p negotiation

195
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:16,879
can be instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of letting operators</font>

196
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:19,099
negotiate manually on the phone when it

197
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,599
comes to can be automated the benefit of

198
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:22,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">course is that you can now negotiate</font>

199
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:26,240
even for minor changes without any human

200
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:29,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost involved for automatic negotiation</font>

201
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,490
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful it has to achieve these</font>

202
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:33,529
three criteria first of all it has to

203
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,240
minimize manual firefighting because

204
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:38,089
that is a primary motivation behind it

205
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,499
if we can do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our operators you</font>

206
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:42,469
can imagine they would start using

207
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:44,930
automatic negotiation and we would rely

208
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:47,569
less on operators firefighting whenever

209
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">arcing changes have to be made the</font>

210
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:50,539
second thing is the solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

211
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,550
automated negotiation should produce

212
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:54,169
there should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be as good or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe even</font>

213
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">better than manual negotiation because</font>

214
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:58,639
if they are not you can still imagine

215
00:07:55,969 --> 00:08:00,529
expecting operators to tweak their

216
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,209
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> even after automated negotiation</font>

217
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:04,370
has been done and which basically undoes

218
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:07,430
all the work we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

219
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,539
with automatic stuff the third and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

220
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,699
most important<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is whatever</font>

221

negotiation protocol of<font color="#E5E5E5"> framework design</font>

222
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,389
has to honor certain real-world

223
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:16,249
constraints constraints of the world we

224
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:17,930
lived<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and we've identified three such</font>

225
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:19,789
constraints that they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

226
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,909
controlled information disclosure across

227
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:24,139
the ISPs we live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world where ISPs</font>

228
00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:26,629
are competing entities and their

229
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:29,269
competitive concerns due to which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

230
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:30,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">peace would be reluctant to give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

231
00:08:29,269 --> 00:08:32,510
all the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the internal</font>

232
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,389
state of the network to otherwise peace

233
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,039
so we do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want a negotiation protocol</font>

234
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,750
in which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know one isp has to tell</font>

235
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the state of</font>

236
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,229
its network and minimize this

237
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,959
information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> flows across the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isp</font>

238
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,850
boundary the second constraint<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

239
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,739
the negotiation protocol should be

240
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,930
independent of the optimization criteria

241
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,209
itself it should not be focused just on

242
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,130
optimizing latency or just an optimizing

243
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:57,199
resource utilization in a network and

244
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,449
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary reason there is twofold one</font>

245
00:08:57,199 --> 00:09:02,420
maybe aspies don't want to reveal their

246
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:04,339
optimization criteria and the second

247
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,839
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that which is more important</font>

248
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:08,089
in some sense the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> isps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

249
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,350
could expect are optimizing the network

250
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,240
for different things one might be

251
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">optimizing for latency and the other one</font>

252
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,350
is just optimizing resource utilization

253
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,420
increase inside its own network or

254
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,880
protecting certain links that tend to

255
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,009
overload so the negotiation protocol has

256
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,810
to be such that these eyes peas with

257
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:25,339
different optimization criteria can

258
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,560
still negotiate with each other to find

259
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:29,930
mutually acceptable routes and the third

260
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,000
is flexible outcomes different pairs of

261
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,769
ISPs have different relationships with

262
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,199
each other some might be peers with each

263
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:37,610
other other ISPs might be providers or

264
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:39,949
customers and you could imagine when

265
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,019
these two isps negotiate with each other

266
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:43,459
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> want different solutions so</font>

267
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:45,199
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for is a</font>

268
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:47,149
mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> that given some input produces</font>

269
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:48,709
a fixed out but what we're looking for

270
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:50,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's more like a negotiation</font>

271
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:52,729
where the outcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the negotiation</font>

272
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,439
actually depends on the people who are

273
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,829
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the relationship between</font>

274
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:59,209
the parties<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are involved in there</font>

275
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:01,099
so is the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> status of her work</font>

276
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:03,138
well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just looked at negotiation</font>

277
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,759
between two neighboring ISPs as of now

278
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:07,250
and you could imagine this negotiation

279
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:09,889
happening at an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet scale where all</font>

280
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:12,709
the ISPs negotiate traffic negotiate all

281
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:15,170
the traffic across variable whichever

282
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:17,388
paths the truck whichever is PS the

283
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,279
traffic is using all of them no traffic

284
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:20,990
is flowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> through them where and you</font>

285
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,850
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine a global negotiation but</font>

286
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,100
what so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've looked at is a</font>

287
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,290
simpler but still challenging problem of

288
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,060
just negotiating between two isps it

289
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,860
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> boils down to picking a</font>

290
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,529
pairing link between them when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

291
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,389
multiple links between them and what

292
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:37,850
we've come up with is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very high-level</font>

293
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:39,500
methodology so I have to warn you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

294
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,029
not going to talk about protocol details

295
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,100
because we haven't really focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

296
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:45,170
details yet but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to come</font>

297
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,029
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level methodology how</font>

298
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,579
this should work and evaluate the

299
00:10:47,029 --> 00:10:52,130
potential benefit of it and it and if it

300
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:54,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">turns out this is actually beneficial we</font>

301
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:57,750
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go down and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come out with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

302
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:59,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">very detailed proposal on this issue</font>

303
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,930
so here's a very simple here's a

304
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:10,050
simplified view of the negotiation

305
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:11,910
methodology we are talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about so</font>

306
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,410
suppose<font color="#E5E5E5"> two isps are negotiating with</font>

307
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,480
each other and they have a bunch of

308
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:18,270
flows to route a readout between each

309
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">other so for starters we say well let</font>

310
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,930
them assign a numeric preference just

311
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">like med and opaque number let them</font>

312
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,620
assign a numeric preference to each of

313
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,120
the option for each flow so<font color="#E5E5E5"> between two</font>

314
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">isps an option is basically which</font>

315
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,560
bearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> length</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick for a particular</font>

316
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,690
flow so good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about using this</font>

317
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,060
methodology is that first this numeric

318
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,790
now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> number is completely opaque</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

319
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,380
hand you a number 20 and as an ISP and

320
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,449
you have no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm talking about</font>

321
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:46,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">how did I come up with that number so my</font>

322
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:48,240
optimization criteria is hidden and you

323
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,850
don't know what like 20 even<font color="#E5E5E5"> them even</font>

324
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,320
the magnitude or what I'm using

325
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,940
basically is not clear to you so very

326
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,130
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> information is revealed just like</font>

327
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,520
and no<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than what's revealed using</font>

328
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,840
meds today second so both high speeds

329
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">have come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the numeric preference</font>

330
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,870
and the second they<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange this</font>

331
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">preference list and the third step is</font>

332
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,800
the most flexible part of the component

333
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,140
here that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Speece take turns to propose</font>

334
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,520
options and while proposing options as

335
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,620
in appearing link for a flow or

336
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,360
something they find good compromises in

337
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,300
the preference list data I will come to

338
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">an example on the next slide and in the</font>

339
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,810
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the negotiation you might want</font>

340
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,640
to reassign the<font color="#CCCCCC"> preferences after some</font>

00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the flows have been negotiated the</font>

343
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,439
potential load in the network changes so

344
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,120
you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about reassigning the</font>

345
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,070
preps and redoing the negotiation step

346
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,230
and you it's flexible and stop whenever

347
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,030
one of the SP wants to one of them k<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

348
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,380
I'm done<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't want to negotiate in</font>

349
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,089
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's when the negotiation</font>

350
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,620
would stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you would implement then</font>

351
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:44,000
go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and implement whatever you want</font>

352
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:46,740
whatever you negotiated in your network

353
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,700
so so here's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

354
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,800
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the simpler of the two</font>

355
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,810
examples I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they were</font>

356
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,810
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce the latency of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> past</font>

357
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:57,300
between them again to isps a and B and

358
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:59,880
two flows one the blue flow going from A

359
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,490
to B an orange one going from B to a the

360
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:05,939
matrix on your right is basically the

361
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:08,430
preference list so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I am saying so</font>

362
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,470
zeros base I put the numeric preference

363
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,979
for the default routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> path shown here</font>

364
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,139
in dark

365
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,180
in zeros just to evaluate how much

366
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:17,130
benefit<font color="#E5E5E5"> they get otherwise so for a to</font>

367
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,689
be was using the bottom peering link so

368
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,839
the preference for both high speeds here

369
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:23,570
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> zeroes and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> B to a was using the top</font>

370
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">reading link and the preference is 0 and</font>

371
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:28,709
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the A to B flow this is the</font>

372
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:31,560
first entry in each of these pairs is

373
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:33,660
the preference for is PA and the second

374
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,000
problem in all of these is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> preference</font>

375
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,399
for is PB so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

376
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,610
this one for a to<font color="#CCCCCC"> b flow what is PA</font>

377
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,290
saying it slightly worse for me to take

378
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:46,380
the traffic to the middle peering link

379
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:49,649
so it assigns a minus<font color="#CCCCCC"> one but taking it</font>

380
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,720
to that but taking it to the top reading

381
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:53,430
link is even worse for me so assign a

382
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,680
heavier minus for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative preference</font>

383
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,630
minus<font color="#E5E5E5"> six similarly similarly be saying</font>

384
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,760
for a to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic it's best for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me if</font>

385
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you bring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it from the top link that's</font>

386
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,810
six and it's it's still good for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

387
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,720
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring it here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just the</font>

388
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:09,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">default so let's say is PA gets to</font>

389
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,680
propose an option first so what it does

390
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,839
it looks at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> preference list okay</font>

391
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the default anyway can I do any</font>

392
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,399
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than what i'm doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now it looks</font>

393
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero minus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one minus six now so</font>

394
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,639
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> my best option the default i'm</font>

395
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,380
good with but then it looks in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case</font>

396
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,649
out there is some place<font color="#E5E5E5"> for optimizing</font>

397
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:28,800
flow flows going from B to a so<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks as</font>

398
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:30,449
this is 00 default but looks here it's 6

399
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,639
and minus<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 you would think that is PA</font>

400
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:34,589
is tempting at proposing this option but

401
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,690
it knows if it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is PB is</font>

402
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:38,130
unlikely to accept this option so

403
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,290
instead of proposing this which is

404
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:42,300
highly negative<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 is PB it tries to find</font>

405
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,370
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good compromise here which is much</font>

406
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,560
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> much better for a but only</font>

407
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,690
slightly worse for be so what it does is

408
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,579
proposes this option and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine</font>

409
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,730
since this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly worse for is</font>

410
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:55,949
PB eyes to be be basically accepting

411
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,110
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> B does the same calculation and</font>

412
00:14:55,949 --> 00:15:00,209
proposes this so what we get is this

413
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,130
solution and if you add a preferences as

414
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:04,050
some rough measure of how much the ice

415
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,089
please have gained in during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the course</font>

416
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:10,199
of the negotiation you can just add you

417
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:13,079
can add<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this minus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 & 4 here so</font>

418
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:14,819
it's gained three and similarly<font color="#CCCCCC"> for is</font>

419
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,699
PB has gained three and end-to-end paths

420
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:19,410
are even better so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically the</font>

421
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:21,269
insight behind why negotiation would

422
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,300
work that both highest peas are actually

423
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:25,730
trading small sacrifices

424
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,069
never the flow is routed not on the

425
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">default path for bigger gains and if you</font>

426
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:32,779
put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> such options or such trades</font>

427
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,910
what you get is better performance for

428
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:43,910
both high speeds individually and for

429
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:45,529
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-to-end path over there so we</font>

430
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:48,709
evaluated the potential of this

431
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:50,750
negotiation using we had we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> measured</font>

435
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,390
and a large number of tier two isps and

436
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,160
we play with all sorts of synthetic

437
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,750
traffic models to understand since we

438
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,670
don't have data available for traffic

439
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,170
like what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nature of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic</font>

440
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,819
that flows across these backbones we

441
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,279
came up with several synthetic traffic

442
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,079
models and evaluated our results for

443
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,760
each of them just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if our results</font>

444
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,479
are sensitive to traffic models as such

445
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,069
and what we did basically we compared 3

446
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,810
routing methodologies one is just the

447
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:22,760

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:25,760
each<font color="#CCCCCC"> SP is looking at its own network</font>

449
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,890
and routing traffic using that optimal

450
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,540
an optimal was basically what is a

451
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:32,029

460
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,810
much opportunity is there to negotiate

463
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,000
then there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> point in negotiating</font>

464
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,160
because we are living<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a very</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about two sets of experiments one</font>

470
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:10,130
for latency reduction how much

00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:12,650
negotiation helps with latency reduction

472
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,689
and the other is hotspot avoidance what

473
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:18,980
happens with short-term overloads in one

more resources are being consumed within

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this more with this motivation to</font>

what this graph is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point here</font>

510
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:40,218
for instance is saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for sixty</font>

511
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,460
percent of the ISPs the reduction in

512
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:44,629
latency is five percent or more and

513
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're two things here one is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

514
00:18:44,629 --> 00:18:48,799
negotiation is very close to optimal so

515
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:51,080
what this is saying is by negotiation

516
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,330
you can come very close<font color="#E5E5E5"> to optimal by</font>

517
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,710
itself so there's not much cost to just

518
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:57,589
negotiating instead of finding the true

519
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:58,969
or globally optimal but there's nothing

520
00:18:57,589 --> 00:19:01,249
going on that there is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

521
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:03,830
aggregate latency reduction here that's

522
00:19:01,249 --> 00:19:06,289
like five percent or the medians even

523
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,210
less but the when you dig deeper there

524
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:10,549
is some flows that really gain big and

525
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,320
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suspect are the flows which</font>

526
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,609
really suffer using early exit roaring

527
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,529
because traffic is routed in the

528
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:17,089
opposite direction<font color="#CCCCCC"> altogether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and at</font>

529
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,070
this point it's not clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me whether</font>

530
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:21,649
the small aggregate production is

531
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:23,629
actually valuable in terms of the

532
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:25,218
benefits it<font color="#E5E5E5"> brings but this is something</font>

533
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:28,089
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get your feedback on or</font>

534
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:30,919
whether it translates into any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

535
00:19:28,089 --> 00:19:32,570
monetary advantage or not but there's a

536
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,999
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing happening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here I</font>

537
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:37,099
mean we saw that optimal can be computed

538
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:38,629
at least for latency the interesting

539
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:40,399
thing here is what the graph on the

540
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:42,379
right is plotting what is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reduction</font>

541
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:44,978
in latency inside each individual

542
00:19:42,379 --> 00:19:47,719
network as<font color="#E5E5E5"> against across both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

543
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:49,220
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we see is if you if you just try</font>

544
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">and get achieve the optimal</font>

545
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,539
one of the ISPs actually suffers a

546
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:55,190
negative reduction it basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> means by</font>

547
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:57,110
moving from default to the optimal

548
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,570
scenario it just so happens that one of

549
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:02,299
the ISPs reduction or latency inside one

550
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:04,340
of the ice<font color="#CCCCCC"> PS actually increases it</font>

551
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:06,168
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is P maybe</font>

552
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,668
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no incentive to negotiate</font>

553
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:09,770
because you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's latency is</font>

554
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:11,330
increasing as a result but the dotted

555
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,168
line here for negotiation basically

556
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:16,760
shows that I space either don't win or

557
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:18,350
both when it's basically a win-win

558
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,539
situation that you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lose</font>

559
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:23,678
by negotiating you are not you're bound

560
00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:25,700
to not lose at all you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> just win</font>

561
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:31,460
let me talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a more interesting</font>

562
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:33,440

sudden changes inside even a

565
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,510
well-engineered network can cause

566
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,309
short-term overloads and the sudden

567
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:43,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">changes could result from failures dos</font>

00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:53,870

580
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,980
traffic traversing the failing and this

581
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:11,480
rerouting happens using those three

582
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,360
routing methodologies are talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

583
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,640
the default selfish routing the second

584
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,408
is optimal an optimal here was computed

585
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,419
using this complex constraint solver

586
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:22,880
that bought sensitive load on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

587
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:25,520
individual links and negotiated routing

588
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,049
and negotiation the metrics used by both

589
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,730
high speeds and negotiation was again

590
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:30,850
since we're evaluating<font color="#CCCCCC"> for lewd was</font>

591
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,659
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> overloading</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network and</font>

592
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:35,120
authorities we measure the potential

593
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:37,640
using with each of these methodologies

594
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,469
and the metric for measuring hot spot

595
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,179
potential is the increase in the link

596
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,549
load before and after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the failure and</font>

597
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:45,289
the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the intuition there is if a</font>

598
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:47,960
link carries 10 times as much traffic

599
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:50,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the failure as before the chances</font>

600
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:54,559
are that link is loaded would be loaded

601
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:55,940
after those changes after rerouting so

602
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,110
here the experiment these graphs are a

603
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,630
little different from the ones I showed

604
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,209
so I'll just run

605
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:03,100
through them this is again experiment

606
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,470
for all the ISP pairs the graph on the

607
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,990
left is depicts what happens inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

608
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">upstream is P and this graph depicts</font>

609
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:12,850
what happens in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the downstream is P and</font>

610
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:15,160
the and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> x-axis is basically the</font>

611
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,530
multiplicative increase in load<font color="#E5E5E5"> relative</font>

612
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,570
to the optimal so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some optimal</font>

613
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,420
strategy which which basically focuses

614
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:24,550
on reducing overload inside both highest

615
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">piece and what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you what do we do when</font>

616
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:30,100
we and compared to that optimal how to

617
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,900
negotiate it and default routing do so

618
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,149
what we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and the dotted line is</font>

619
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,890
again for for default and the solid line

620
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,440
is for negotiated so what this point

621
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:40,330
here is saying is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that load ratio was</font>

622
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,770
like twice the ratio basically means a

623
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,070
two hundred percent increase in link

624
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:46,629
load compared to the optimal over here

625
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:48,639
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we seeing here just by the shape</font>

626
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:50,920
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> curve here is that there are</font>

627
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain links if you use default routing</font>

628
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,220
there are certain links in the topology

629
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,439
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> carry you know two hundred</font>

630
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,180
percent or more load so the tendency for

631
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:02,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the links to get overloaded is much</font>

632
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:04,330
higher with default routing and ideally

633
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,070
what you would want<font color="#E5E5E5"> in any solution that</font>

634
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,139
to come close as to the optimal is

635
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,389
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the negotiation a line</font>

636
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,730
that goes all the way up to one so

637
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,230
negotiation we see since it's like it

638
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,390
does go all the way up to bond but it

639
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,850
closes there so incensed it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> close it's</font>

640
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:22,150
very close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the optimal but not quite</font>

641
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:23,889
there there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost to that but</font>

642
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,810
nevertheless you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the negotiation</font>

643
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:28,120
reduces the possibilities of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hotspots in</font>

644
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network which once the possibility</font>

645
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,239
of hotspot reduces then they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

646
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,949
this basically means there are fewer

647
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,990
problems for operators to resolve

648
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:38,500
because no short-term overload happens

649
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:41,140
as a result of changes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network so</font>

650
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to conclude my talk here and</font>

651
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,400
basically just summarize what I just

652
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,470
told you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the motivation behind a</font>

653
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,390
work basically here was<font color="#CCCCCC"> intimate</font>

654
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:51,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">interdomain routing or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp policies are</font>

655
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:53,530
based largely on local information and

656
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,870
which has cost in terms of the quality

657
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the paths we can achieve on the poor</font>

come by<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the network can lead to</font>

661
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,680
oscillatory behavior with people making

662
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,899
changes independently without any sort

<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font>

664
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:11,120
view but a bigger cost is in terms of

00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> playlist I'm the management is</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">this go away in terms of management</font>

670
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,750
costs in the performance cost by just

671
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,870
automating the negotiation and our early

672
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,730
results basically point that automated

673
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:31,159
negotiation can help and none of the

674
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,330
ISPs actually loses by negotiating and

675
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,280
which is which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the way the whole</font>

676
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:37,370
negotiation framework is set up that you

677
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:40,430
are guaranteed to not lose during

678
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:43,070
negotiation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd love your feedback</font>

679
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:45,470
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and basically just one cushion in</font>

does not what kinds of problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

686
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:58,820

687
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,530
do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the network I while I focused</font>

688
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,750
on latency reduction and hotspot

689
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,370
avoidance you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of automated</font>

690
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,020
negotiation as a load balancing tool

691
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,729
that you use with your providers or

692
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,800
customers when you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to balance</font>

693
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,090
load across multiple providers or across

speeding links of the same provider

695
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:15,199
answer and there is a paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> available on</font>

696
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:17,179
that URL there that talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,150
experiments in detail which I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

698
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,410
time to and explains the expense the

00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,880
whole thing in more detail than I could

700
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:24,880
get you in my talk thanks

701
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:46,520
Nick now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

702
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,610
yes there's time for questions here

703
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,860
please we just didn't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

704
00:25:55,610 --> 00:26:00,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">deep-fried up I'll stay here for a</font>

705
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,809
moment please<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

706
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,889
was a very interesting next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step in how</font>

707
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:06,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that so if there's questions</font>

708
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:08,929
please rush right up to the mic right

709
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:21,140
now because we're a little tight on time

710
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:24,100
so yeah I'm manish from merritt network

711
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:27,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">i had a question regarding your approach</font>

712
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,939
in addressing this problem now a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

713
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:31,100
words that you've used seem to be

714
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,289
indicative of using the min-max

715
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,029
principal and game theory and global

716
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:38,480
Optima so is that the approach that

717
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:40,250
you're taking in this work we did look

718
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,570
at we are still looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so we</font>

719
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,549
are still looking at game theory but

720
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:45,770
from a different perspective we're

721
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:48,379
looking at game theory mainly what can

722
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:50,120
we say about the incentive compatibility

723
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,309
and things like that of the solution and

724
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,658
I mean and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prop and just</font>

725
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:55,309
articulating the properties of the

00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:59,110
solution in terms of Pareto optimality

00:26:55,309 --> 00:27:01,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">are just social optimal and things like</font>

728
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:03,439
what the impact would be of the

729
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,179
resulting solution when one of the ice

730
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,610
piece begins to cheat and things like

731
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:09,740
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't made much headway in</font>

732
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:12,799
terms of actually applying some solid

733
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,779
tools from game theory and in for

734
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,330
certain nice properties that you might

735
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:19,370
want out of it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have ideas I'm</font>

736
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:20,779
happy to talk to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that thanks</font>

737
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:22,879
but but you're writing general game

738
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:27,250
theory does look like a tool that would

739
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,250
be it's meant for scenarios like this

740
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,080
Bruce<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hana from park it's a little hard</font>

741
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:35,989
to tell from just the cursory overview

742
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,279
presentation here it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

743
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,590
assumption you're making is where you've

744
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,659
got provider a and provider be that if

745
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:43,100
they both play nice and decide to

746
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:46,220
cooperate with each other with this

747
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:48,070
automated protocol then there's mutual

748
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,860
benefit

749
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,419
the previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are brought up the</font>

750
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:53,560
issue of game theory it seems to me you

751
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,740
can end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a prisoner's dilemma</font>

752
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:59,530
situation where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I as the bad provider</font>

753
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,360
try to trick the other guy into being

754
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:03,399
nice to me but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meantime I'm back</font>

755
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,899
stabbing him by taking the low-cost

756
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:10,150
route<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I try to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

757
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,160
take take a path that minimizes my<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

758
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:15,520
but the meantime I'm taking my<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-cost</font>

759
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,650
egress and making him pay to carry the

760
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,720
traffic so does your research address

761
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:21,850
the situation where one provider tries

762
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,460
to defect from the cooperative

763
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:27,490
arrangement and trick the other guy into

764
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:29,290
cooperating it it does so but in ave

765
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,940
trivial manner and the tribute manner is

766
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,040
the following if you know the default

767
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:35,230
routing then no matter what the other

768
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:39,070
isp says the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other provide bad provider</font>

769
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:40,690
says you cannot lose by negotiating so

770
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,370
now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point becomes that you have in</font>

771
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,350
this default scenario which in<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font>

772
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:47,260
both high speeds<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I realize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

773
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:49,240
cost is and as a provider I know what my

774
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,400
cost is and by negotiating with you what

775
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,650
my cost is what the cost of the

776
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,060
negotiated solution is so the trivial

777
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:58,000
answer I responding is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

778
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:59,560
will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> negotiate if I lose now it's in</font>

779
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,480
the cheating I<font color="#E5E5E5"> squeeze</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in trust to</font>

780
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:04,659
actually give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me incentive to negotiate</font>

781
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,340
and you know because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you gain a lot by</font>

782
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:09,400
cheating you being a lot by negotiating

783
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,350
but you also have to give me basically

784
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,290
give me some carrot to play otherwise

785
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:15,969
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to play at all and so then</font>

786
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:17,500
the issue becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yes there is some</font>

787
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:19,330
margin for cheating and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> result of</font>

788
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,520
the cheating is that the gains from

789
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:23,560
negotiation may or may not be divided<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

790
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,389
a fair manner whatever the definition of

791
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,950
fear might be and we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still looking</font>

792
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,300
into this whole fairness issue but

793
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:31,390
beyond that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good answer</font>

794
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:34,210
yet ok so I'm guaranteed not to lose but

795
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:38,490
yes my competitor might gain more than

796
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right that's true ok yeah thanks</font>

797
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:50,590
maybe that included you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is on</font>

798
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:52,600
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tom vest no picks a dress actually</font>

799
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:55,510
I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address the game theory</font>

800
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:58,389
issue as well you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start off with</font>

801
00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:00,310
mentioning that this assumes absence of

802
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,740
local information but in fact the<font color="#CCCCCC"> model</font>

803
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:04,830
you set up which is correctly identified

804
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,480
as a prisoner's dilemma in a way

805
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:09,520
implicitly assumes perfect information

806
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,490
on both sides the way you've set it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

807
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,970
is the incentives are<font color="#E5E5E5"> or equivalent or</font>

808
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:19,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">symmetrical and in most real-life</font>

809
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:21,250
circumstances are considering<font color="#E5E5E5"> that even</font>

810
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,670
appearing between two peers generally

811
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:27,040
they won't receive each other is

812
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:28,240
absolutely identical and since most of

813
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,610
the interconnections are actually not

814
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">peering but what are some sort of</font>

00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:34,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">compensation based arrangement you'll</font>

816
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,760
almost never get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a situation where the</font>

817
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:38,620
two parties actually do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality</font>

818
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,570
without knowing it have perfectly

819
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:44,800
symmetrical views of the relative merits

820
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:48,189
of coming to an agreement so you always

821
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:50,500
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who sees the relative</font>

gains issue in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is sort of the</font>

ship replica shipwreck of game theory

00:30:52,320 --> 00:31:00,490
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network modeling</font>

825
00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:02,860
well yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difference</font>

826
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:04,510
in the information aspect that there is

827
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfect information but the issue is</font>

828
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:08,770
like how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much information is being</font>

829
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:11,440
revealed across the boundary which is a

830
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:13,120
prime concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> I fail to understand</font>

831
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,370
whether the ocean was that information

832
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,260
is the interest are always aligned is

833
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,729
the issue there or the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> is perfect</font>

834
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,180
information is not available even

835
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,180
locally

836
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:35,899
apologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the way you're</font>

837
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:37,970
calculating<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in effect it embeds the</font>

838
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:40,809
assumption that the payoffs are

839
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:44,629
symmetrical and for that to be

840
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:46,580
operationally realistic in some ways

841
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:50,059
they have to be that that's the way the

842
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:52,369
providers have to perceive it as well we

843
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:54,529
okay so you're saying you're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

844
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:56,799
the negotiation as equal partners I

845
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:59,419
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can suddenly change based on</font>

846
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,029
maybe that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the yes maybe that's where</font>

847
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:05,419
that's where I would diverge because i

848
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:08,840
would say in most situations that

849
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:15,470
wouldn't be the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> so okay I talk to</font>

850
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:18,529
you after dog there's a simple um Randy

851
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:23,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bush iij I'm that strange minority here</font>

852
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:25,970
I come from an ISP oh and I heard the

853
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:31,309
presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I cheated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i also read the</font>

854
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:34,759
paper and my perception tom is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

855
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:39,619
whether we come as equals or not what

856
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:46,039
matters is in this negotiation I don't

857
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:51,259
over disclose and I don't lose I may not

858
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:55,249
gain as much but I don't lose and the

859
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:58,639
truth is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is an operator and an</font>

860
00:32:55,249 --> 00:33:01,730
operator does peering that's all I'm

861
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:08,029
interested in that meets my needs I

862
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:12,630
don't perceive myself as winning by you

863
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:15,150
losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't</font>

864
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:17,730
I'm here trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a better network</font>

865
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:21,390
and I don't think the operators with

866
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:24,990
whom I peer are bad actors I like the

867
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:28,350
fact that this doesn't encourage bad

868
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:31,680
acting and that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't introduce a</font>

869
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:35,639
lot of complexity and yet I think a

870
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:38,270
difficult problem I smell that you're

871
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:43,700
actually doing something useful and

872
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:43,700
thank you it was good thank you
