1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:07,439
good afternoon ladies gentlemen hope you

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,190
enjoyed your lunch and and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,639
too tired yet my name is yoshi tanaka

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,890
i'm working for cable and wireless

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:21,779
within the engineering group both in the

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:26,550
public areas 12 1273 part as well as in

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:32,219
the so-called private is triple 45

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:36,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">network which is the mpls VPN</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> net</font>

9
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:40,469
network so let's start this talk is

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:44,040
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect one service</font>

11
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:48,170
providers MPLS network within together

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,170
with another service providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

13
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:58,440
these networks are designed to to be

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,250
interconnected according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to RFC 2547</font>

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:06,590
bits which is layer 3 VPNs no public

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:09,590
internet stuff and yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like that</font>

17
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font>

18
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:19,850
sorry

19
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:23,689
okay and this presentation is divided

20
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:28,360
into two major parts at a generous

21
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:32,658
section which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a short review how</font>

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:34,970
know what the methods are in a from a

23
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:40,850
technical perspective according the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC</font>

24
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:42,920
2547 and the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> part is just how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CW</font>

25
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:47,949
has has standard with other service

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:50,479
providers and a short report what

27
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:57,439
problems we had once we have done that

28
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:59,330
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and the concept the</font>

29
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,830
considerations we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that are</font>

30
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:06,908
necessary to think of one's eyes peas

31
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:10,639
think of doing the interconnections and

32
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:14,000
a very very short look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the future</font>

33
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:18,890
on what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on in the IDF meetings</font>

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,810
and but this is just then a short report

35
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,600
on what I personally found very

36
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:26,690
interesting so let's start with the

37
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">first part the general section what the</font>

38
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:36,370
different methods<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interconnections</font>

39
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:36,370
yeah okay there's the agenda once again

40
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:50,099
yeah I've talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the first</font>

41
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:57,239
method is to isps connect their networks

42
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:59,879
with neighboring PE routers and they are

43
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:04,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">connected by a year leased lines process</font>

44
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:10,319
Ethernet ATM whatsoever probably process

45
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:13,069
and the first possibility is to use and

46
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:20,730
back-to-back<font color="#E5E5E5"> VF on the connected</font>

47
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:24,349
interfaces which leads to every VPN that

48
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,970
needs to be extended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the neighboring</font>

49
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:31,858
<font color="#CCCCCC">AAS will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> configured as a sub in</font>

50
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:36,209
interface of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two PS and each sub</font>

51
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:38,670
interface will reside then in on certain

52
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:43,940
VF which is done customer one custom to

53
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,940
customer three custom form and and so on

54
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:55,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">to miss something yeah i think the this</font>

55
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:57,750
possibility is pretty much known and

56
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:05,909
everyone interested has<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatest that</font>

57
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:09,180
stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far the disadvantages is that</font>

58
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:11,819
from an operational point of view the

59
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,879
conflict<font color="#E5E5E5"> the config stented tend to grow</font>

60
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:17,789
very large and the troubleshooting

61
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,899
section is pretty annoying than for the

62
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:24,320
operational folks so we didn't decide to

63
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that one</font>

64
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:39,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">see that's coloring yeah the second</font>

65
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:42,390
method is a little different again we

66
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:50,940
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two neighboring PE routers</font>

67
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:54,969
and they do not exchange the the the

68
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:57,790
labeled<font color="#E5E5E5"> PGP prefixes from from the</font>

69
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,970
certain via via the RFS i know from from

70
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:04,330
the different via via FS but they

71
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:08,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">exchange only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their / 32 loopback IPS</font>

72
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:14,830
from all the IP from all dps of the

73
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:16,810
neighboring ISPs and the PE routers

74
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:20,770
where the customers are connected on

75
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:28,710
both ends just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to multi hope multi-hop</font>

76
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:28,710
ebgp sessions yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so good</font>

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:42,639
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got the point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> within Moodle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ebgp</font>

78
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:51,508
sessions and these the third possibility

79
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:57,129
is that again the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two PE devices in</font>

80
00:05:51,509 --> 00:06:00,340
now exchange the<font color="#CCCCCC"> labeled IP VPN before</font>

81
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:02,650
prefixes of the certain via<font color="#CCCCCC"> VFS based on</font>

82
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:08,020
route targets and the route and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

83
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:10,120
matching route distinguishes so compared

84
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,008
to the possibility before we don't

85
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,729
exchange the loop backs of all the

86
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:21,879
period of all the customer connected

87
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:26,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece but we only exchanged these label</font>

88
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:31,029
prefixes that are really that only

89
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:35,258
aren't needed to a bit between the two

90
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:37,449
service providers based on the route

91
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:38,830
targets it is possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to filter based</font>

92
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:41,889
on the route targets and routers

93
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:45,818
<font color="#CCCCCC">English's and so on but we come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

94
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:48,849
point a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit later I think yeah</font>

95
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:51,729
these were then the three possibilities

96
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:59,080
I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is clear so far any</font>

97
00:06:51,729 --> 00:07:06,279
questions here<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok now the point</font>

98
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:09,250
what we have chosen and and why just to

99
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:12,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure once again CW operates two</font>

100
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:15,490
different networks the one is a s 1273

101
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:22,180
the public IP network which is you know

102
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:28,599
internet and and on that net network we

103
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:34,180
don't operate mpls VPN for mpls VPN

104
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:37,389
Slayer 3 VPNs we have built and operate

105
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:42,909
a different network which is areas which

106
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:47,270
is run under a s triple 54 which is

107
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:51,680
entirely at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very moment running</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

108
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:57,200
vpns according to her RFC 24 25 40

109
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,610
session and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interconnection method</font>

110
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,260
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> chosen with other service</font>

111
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:05,600
providers was the third option just just

112
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,900
to make sure which one that that was the

113
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:12,800
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> neighbouring peas exchange the</font>

114
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:15,020
labeled IP IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> v4 VPN previous can pre</font>

115
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:20,870
prefixes based on real targets and route

116
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:22,969
distinguishes oops<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have more yeah this</font>

117
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not a current slide I the more</font>

118
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:29,480
descriptions here was the stuff from

119
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:32,630
before oops I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to change</font>

120
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:36,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the latest one but</font>

121
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,580
there's no nope no problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

122
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:53,149
ok

123
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,770
just one second

124
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,579
ok

125
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:26,110
huh

126
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:28,500
just let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring anything okay just one</font>

127
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,500
second

128
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:43,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay here we go</font>

129
00:09:49,820 --> 00:10:01,520
okay sorry for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the short break yeah so</font>

130
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:05,530
the last point was what method we have

131
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:09,230
chosen again this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the third method</font>

132
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:12,560
exchanging the labeled VIP VPN before

133
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:17,060
prefixes based on the raw targets and

134
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,910
route distinguishes so our network looks

135
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this we have four regions which are</font>

136
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:28,189
conferred<font color="#CCCCCC"> Confederated under one is</font>

137
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:32,060
trivial Phi triple 45 and we have a UK

138
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:35,390
region which is which is using on

139
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:38,739
private a yes and US and European and an

140
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:44,689
Asian Pacific region the regions are

141
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:46,970
either directly connected on other

142
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:50,540
regions<font color="#CCCCCC"> our transit regions like for job</font>

143
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:53,390
for the asian-pacific region there's the

144
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,520
main main route going through the UUs

145
00:10:53,390 --> 00:11:04,189
region and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup route</font>

146
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:11,660
through the UK region<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so once we</font>

147
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:15,020
first have decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do inter</font>

148
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:22,430
connections with other carriers carriers

149
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:24,860
that are that have greater carriers that

150
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:32,060

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:34,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have pops also we thought it is</font>

153
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:41,810
once we went into the test stage in the

154
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:47,000
labs we found different points bits and

155
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:51,699
pieces the that are critical or at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

156
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,040
good good to think of and we found that

157
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:57,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those and I'm going through all</font>

158
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,500
all these points<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the first one other</font>

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:13,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you we go the route distinguisher</font>

162
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:19,040
is an 8-byte field that is prepended to

172
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:03,380
into the trouble that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rrd values</font>

173
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:06,320
didn't match so the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> neighboring</font>

174
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:10,960
service provider had different values

175
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:16,490
then then we had and we ran into memory

176
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:19,280
we ran into routing problems which were

177
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:27,680
memory usage the consumption was pretty

178
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:31,130
high and and and we had at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> topic</font>

179
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:34,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">head prefixes going going around the</font>

180
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:39,610
both networks and we try to overcome

181
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:39,610
that yeah this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide</font>

182
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:51,939
yeah once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have different different</font>

183
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:55,420
route distinguishes that are exported

184
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:58,120
from at both ends or from both ISPs they

185
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:02,019
are valid in both clouds but the

186
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:08,949
implications are that that every prefix

187
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:13,060
is at least at 22 x 22<font color="#CCCCCC"> 92 times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

188
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:15,310
one with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a service provider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once rd and</font>

189
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:20,939
one with the service provider tools rd

190
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:24,189
and and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> match and very funny</font>

191
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:27,730
problems arise then so it is very

192
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:32,920
crucial that the service providers agree

193
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:37,420
on the same route distinguishes<font color="#E5E5E5"> for one</font>

194
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:44,949
certain via VPN or customer or VF as you

195
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:49,290
want to call it yeah they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

196
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:49,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">same on both ends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

197
00:14:51,080 --> 00:15:00,800
yeah I said I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> hold before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them they</font>

198
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:04,490
should be the same yeah one operational

199
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,800
issue is here there are some tools

200
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:12,490
around that can be either bought or

201
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:16,760
self-written from or freeware some

202
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:20,150
provisioning tools use<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard-coded route</font>

203
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:23,480
distinguishes like like you add a new

204
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:27,800
customer to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> system so they increase</font>

205
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:34,120
the last dinner route distinguisher by

206
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:37,280
one and and and this makes the automatic

207
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,890
provisioning or event of a new customer

208
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:45,970
to the VPN<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever a little bit hard so</font>

209
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:48,949
manual intervention is probably not

210
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:52,510
what's what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> up Edward yeah you you</font>

211
00:15:48,950 --> 00:16:01,310
cannot avoid manual intervention there

212
00:15:52,510 --> 00:16:04,160
ok bay-based basically the same applies

213
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:07,959
for the router targets the router

214
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,969
targets is an extended bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> comma</font>

215
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:14,810
community that is used within the

216
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:22,970
address families IPA ipv4 now IP VPN

217
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:25,280
before family<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and it is used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

218
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:32,120
determine whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefixes accepted by</font>

219
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:37,100
another PE or not so filtering yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

220
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:40,220
an interesting point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> router targets</font>

221
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:47,560
is here I've had the slide before which

222
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:51,860
was this one yeah we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> filtering of off</font>

223
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,839
traffic from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> one area to n to</font>

224
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:57,590
another based on the route targets that

225
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:00,860
that means once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have customers that</font>

226
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,640
are only there in the UUs region we

227
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,770
don't propagate the

228
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:08,250
the VPN routes to the other region

229
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:10,589
unless the customer hasn't got aside an

230
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:14,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">understood the customer has a site there</font>

231
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:19,050
so we need to leak them in that case

232
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:22,140
between the regions but otherwise we do

233
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:26,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">not export the route to the other</font>

234
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:28,380
regions just to save memory and he has

235
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:34,560
stuff like that so back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your real</font>

236
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:40,440
target the numbering scheme is again<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

237
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:44,070
same we use on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left hand side 44 45</font>

238
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:51,540
and then again we do again decimal

239
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:58,950
numbers so again the route<font color="#CCCCCC"> target</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

240
00:17:51,540 --> 00:18:01,230
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be negotiated between the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

241
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:04,290
service providers because this this

242
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:10,800
makes the filtering of unwanted prefixes

243
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:14,100
easier and one could<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that that why</font>

244
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:17,550
why not Aria writing the the targets on

245
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,439
the two neighboring border router<font color="#CCCCCC"> peas</font>

246
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:22,889
where weather suit where the two service

247
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:35,220
providers meet<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet basically it would be</font>

248
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:42,090
possible but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't do that 47</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

249
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:44,790
several several reasons one was one was

250
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:47,040
that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to reread that the</font>

251
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:51,360
route target but rerouting the

252
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:56,399
distinguisher wasn't possible and the

253
00:18:51,360 --> 00:19:01,129
manipulation is only doable on the

254
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:05,220
import side not on the export side so I

255
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:08,090
again the last point<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is once you</font>

256
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,950
connect with<font color="#CCCCCC"> another service provider</font>

257
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:15,030
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that both ends try to</font>

258
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,690
have now make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> both service</font>

259
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,990
providers

260
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:26,929
use the same route target for each VPN

261
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:30,809
they want to exchange<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah this is</font>

262
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:32,789
this is just a short description why we

263
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:37,710
have done that and what the implications

264
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:40,110
are I have to admit<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide wasn't by</font>

265
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:45,360
me so I had a hard time to to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

266
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:49,559
it and yeah to explain that is a little

267
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:59,519
bit odd for me right now so I can't say

268
00:19:49,559 --> 00:20:03,860
too much here I'm sorry yeah it's it's

269
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:12,480
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> arm it's this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so so far clear yes no</font>

270
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:19,110
hope so okay an important<font color="#CCCCCC"> point to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

271
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:21,559
of this also that each service provider

272
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:26,459
has a different quality of service model

273
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:30,928
having different service classes one has

274
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:35,789
three process of the goals while others

275
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:44,100
have four or a five and one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

276
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:48,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">here that there's a need to to to do a</font>

277
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:50,158
mapping of one model from service

278
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,500
provider a to the model of<font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font>

279
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,080
program provider be understood the

280
00:20:52,500 --> 00:21:00,120
customers would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> treated unfair in a</font>

281
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:02,939
in the way that that the that the may be

282
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,658
better maybe better cross model or

283
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:10,649
service class silver from cells provide

284
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:12,710
a is in South prob provider be something

285
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:16,889
a little bit worse but also called

286
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:22,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">consumer service oh there's a need to to</font>

287
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:25,199
to to map these service classes and this

288
00:21:22,009 --> 00:21:29,049
and there are only two points where what

289
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:34,090
this is important on the ingress PE

290
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:38,259
where the customer traffic gets labeled

291
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:43,799
and cute and also on the egress PE

292
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:43,799
between the two service providers and

293
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:56,379
yeah and yeah yeah this is the interest

294
00:21:53,289 --> 00:22:04,269
so here's here's a little example how

295
00:21:56,379 --> 00:22:08,019
this mapping couldn't could be done the

296
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:11,289
implication of of that is that the PE

297
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:13,570
router must support the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other service</font>

298
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:18,999
providers cross model yeah as I told you

299
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:20,918
before and yes yeah I think I've told it

300
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:27,690
before he is just the slide that

301
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:27,690
describes it a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better okay</font>

302
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:41,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have told that I've told that yeah I</font>

303
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:46,160
think yeah this is largest just what

304
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:52,850
I've told you before I just changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

305
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:55,220
slides not in time my bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay</font>

306
00:22:52,850 --> 00:23:01,990
here's an example how this could how

307
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:11,560
this could work with their the customers

308
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:13,970
label no I'm sorry little bit nervous<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

309
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:17,840
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ensure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that service providers</font>

310
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:20,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">won gold and silver and so on service</font>

311
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:25,750
classes are mapped with with with our

312
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,750
classes that can be named different and

313
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:32,960
we want to avoid unfair treatment of the

314
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:37,760
customers either on our side or on the

315
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:41,600
on the other side and and so we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

316
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:49,010
mapping of the EXP bits which are then

317
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:51,230
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dscp values so far mmm the menu</font>

318
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">people the manipulation as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font>

319
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:56,330
perform can all only be done on the

320
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:59,000
injury site which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> either the customer</font>

321
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:02,629
site whether the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cust the P where the</font>

322
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,610
customer is connected or the PE whether

323
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:11,060
to service providers have their

324
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:15,260
connections and both service providers

325
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:19,399
are responsible to to know the other

326
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:22,310
service providers values or classes and

327
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:25,460
to map them accordingly then the mapping

328
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:28,940
unfortunately is done totally under men

329
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:30,560
manual basis with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hope that the</font>

330
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:35,090
other cells provider doesn't change

331
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:39,020
their across model without telling all

332
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:50,540
their neighboring ISPs

333
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:52,810
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay another point is Brazilians like</font>

334
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,460
like in the public IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> network we want to</font>

335
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:59,470
avoid just having one link with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

336
00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:02,540
neighboring<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP so having multiple</font>

337
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:08,870
peering sites or interconnection sides

338
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:10,820
and having multiple multiple points

339
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:16,939
where where we connect with other

340
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:20,270
service providers bless you we have the

341
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:22,760
we have the same issues like Randy head

342
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:25,340
in his presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> before with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sub</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">optimal routing or a symmetric routing</font>

344
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:36,379
or stuff like that just as a side note

345
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:49,270
this asymmetric or sub optimal routing

346
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:49,270
can can lead to to influence the the the

347
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:59,440
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> level agreements and it is easy</font>

350
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:10,520
cust<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we try to avoid either</font>

351
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:13,250
a symmetric routing or sub optimal

352
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:16,340
routing and there are ways to it into to

353
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:20,180
do that and we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from Phil</font>

354
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:22,699
Smith's bgp introduction yesterday using

<font color="#E5E5E5">matts youth using logo crafts and stuff</font>

356
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:37,580
like that yeah mad local press or even

357
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:42,350
come the standard communities given that

358
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:48,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">both ISPs a don't filter standard</font>

communities and<font color="#CCCCCC"> b accept them and and</font>

360
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:57,370
transport them through

361
00:26:50,710 --> 00:27:02,679
their own network so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay security</font>

362
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:07,770
security is even there an issue 11 would

363
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:10,690
say that mpls nap on MPLS based VPNs

364
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:15,240
once they are built on a seven in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

are not reach reachable from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> world but there are still some</font>

369
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:33,159
issues we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two points</font>

370
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:40,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">between the peace between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the service</font>

371
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:45,929
providers and and even the CEO outers<font color="#CCCCCC"> ze</font>

372
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,929
at to PE connection so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid</font>

373
00:27:53,799 --> 00:28:07,418
okay so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to hurry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

374
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:09,899
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay so these are the that</font>

375
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:13,230
the major two points where we want to

376
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:16,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that the devices cannot be</font>

377
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:18,850
taken over by someone else or when the

378
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:25,809
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> even has an break out through</font>

379
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:28,928
the VPN to the connector no sorry we

380
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:33,129
have an we offer an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet break out</font>

381
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:35,279
through the VPN to the global 12 773

382
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:37,959
network and we want to ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

383
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,649
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet break our traffic is going</font>

384
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">through firewalls and no one sees the</font>

385
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:45,668
the sea to pee links from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outside</font>

386
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,279
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we do want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to avoid that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

387
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:50,649
one sees<font color="#CCCCCC"> the p2p links outside the world</font>

388
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:54,220
so there are different<font color="#CCCCCC"> math math methods</font>

389
00:28:50,649 --> 00:29:02,139
on the Seas we could use standard acl's

390
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:04,929
and I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay so these are the</font>

391
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:11,789
major two points we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> identified as</font>

392
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:16,059
secure as security concern points okay

393
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:19,389
stuff that we consider to test or

394
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:22,989
implement soon we want to support

395
00:29:19,389 --> 00:29:27,820
carrier supporting carrier stuff this is

396
00:29:22,989 --> 00:29:35,109
currently in a test stage right now we

397
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:37,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to we want to yeah use a little bit</font>

398
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:39,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oam stuff which is currently</font>

399
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">going on within the ITF and we're</font>

400
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:48,220
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward to see something from</font>

401
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:52,149
the vendors and<font color="#CCCCCC"> draft martini layer to</font>

402
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:54,809
VPNs which we do not have right now but

403
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:58,119
this this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is being</font>

404
00:29:54,809 --> 00:30:02,200
implemented i would say in September

405
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:04,240
this year and the last side the future

406
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,509
stuff which i think is is pretty

407
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,130
interesting from the I IETF side is

408
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:14,310
inside

409
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:18,790
working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> pw III and this isn't the</font>

410
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:21,639
pseudowire edge to edge and<font color="#CCCCCC"> an emulation</font>

411
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:25,389
which is which covers currently

412
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:27,400
point-to-point links and then there we c

413
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:31,300
ZB stuff which also covers

414
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:34,150
point-to-multipoint links<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is</font>

415
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:36,399
from the ITF side yeah what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

416
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:38,560
was the interesting part most

417
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:44,920
interesting part so if there are any

418
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:47,230
questions either<font color="#CCCCCC"> right right right a</font>

419
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:50,350
male so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have time to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it or</font>

420
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:53,920
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside because we are really short</font>

421
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:56,679
on on time get kappa be later and ask

422
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,860
ask there thank you are there any

423
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,860
questions
