19
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:57,420
finally I'll give the conclusions we

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:20,330
some other unknown reasons as you know

239
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:13,509
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first one is a changing rotors</font>

wrote impact routing packets are usually

243
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:25,070
given higher priority for us for

244
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:28,910

dropping to avoid the dropping<font color="#CCCCCC"> roti mag</font>

246
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:34,959
packet the second reason for this is the

247
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,820
less network congestion because of the

248

252
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:55,460

yearly a statistical results and you can

also also<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how how this area has</font>

changed for example which interface have

296
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:39,950
had gone down or gone up currently this

<font color="#E5E5E5">completed soon let's look at the</font>

300
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,720
troubleshooting of the intro domain

301
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:56,000
routing instability as i said earlier

302
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,130
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> although we have identified some</font>

304
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:04,369
there was too many changes that we

305
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:07,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">couldn't we could not explain why is it</font>

306
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:09,919
is this difficult mainly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

307
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:12,770
rotting problems tend to occur

308
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,600
intermittently so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is difficult to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

309
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,910

you know time leaf type in a timely

311
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:24,110
fashion so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think that the task of</font>

312
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:28,280
data collection for troubleshooting

313
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:31,550
should not rely on operators instead it

314
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:34,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be combined to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instability</font>

315
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:37,280
detection system so that when the system

finds that something is changing it can

where where to collect the data the

router that originated the changing area

330
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:23,870
say because this router is most likely

331
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:27,420
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what had happened and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:51,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">also collect data from such network</font>

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,980
conclude today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have talked about the</font>

344
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,070
results of some measurements that we did

<font color="#E5E5E5">on intradermal rotting instability we</font>

found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that regardless of the network</font>

scale the info domain routing

348
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:25,770
instability can occur frequently and

349
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:28,560
persistently we think the result is not

350
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:31,920
likely to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be limited on the networks</font>

351
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:34,800
that we have investigated so we'd like

352
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,260
to recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you deploy a</font>

brief question while you're collecting

375
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:55,710
the data on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual instabilities in</font>

376
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:58,590
the ospf environment did you look at

377
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:01,110
whether there was actually any traffic

378
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,240
loss at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time of the instability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

379
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,399
doing end hosts measurements on the

00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,220
prefixes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're changing based on</font>

381
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:10,559
the LSA information you had collected oh

382
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:14,909
I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you repeat that you'd</font>

383
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:17,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually do tests against</font>

384
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:19,980
any hosts on the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if there</font>

385
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:23,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a reach ability problem during these</font>

386
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,590
in periods of routing and stability or

387
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:30,679
did the instability have no impact on

388
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,678
the reach ability of hosts oh oh yes we

389
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:38,668
especially especially about the two

390
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:42,269
years ago when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network bandwidth is</font>

391
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:45,000
is quite low there were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of network</font>

392
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:47,039
congestion other we observe the much

393
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,250
instability caused by the network

394
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:55,350
congestion so we lost we lost lost the

395
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:58,460
connection to<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside from time two</font>

396
00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:01,610
times that really annoyed the earth
