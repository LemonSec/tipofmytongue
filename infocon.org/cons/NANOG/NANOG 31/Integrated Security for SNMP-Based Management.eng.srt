<font color="#E5E5E5">okay i know i am the the only thing that</font>

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,790
stands between you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a plane or your</font>

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,640
to say thank you to dr. Harris for for

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:28,529
putting us on she's done a great job so

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:30,269
round of applause my name is Wes<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font>

10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,850
occur<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a company called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sparta</font>

11
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,550
we do mostly consulting work but I'm

12
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,899
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking today about SNMP</font>

13
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,489
which I know is a topic that many of you

14
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:39,480
hate but I promise<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make this fun and</font>

15
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,339
some of the questions I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to ask</font>

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">you you'll find useful regardless of</font>

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,700
whether you like SNMP or not this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,629
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be an interactive session so</font>

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,989
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people know how to raise their</font>

20
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:50,280
hands so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my pulse oh all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

21
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,370
that didn't raise your hands I know to

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,629
exclude you from the count so really

23
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">briefly i'm going to go over the problem</font>

24
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,440
space in the solution space and the

25
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,029
operator requirements and the questions

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,649
and answers really<font color="#CCCCCC"> i expect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,120
majority<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it i'm going to actually be</font>

28
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,840
asking you guys questions rather than

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,658
the other way around so really briefly

30
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,950
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> SP security history is long and</font>

31
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,630
involved and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over it</font>

32
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,100
in detail but snmpv1 came you know 1998

33
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,860
snmpv3 which finally did add security

34
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,369
came in and excuse me in 1888 snmpv3

35
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,340
finally came in 1998 and added decent

36
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:28,530
authentication and encryption and it is

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,030
more secure than version 1 and version 2

38
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,070
but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the problems in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the design</font>

39
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,170
process is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that nobody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asked the</font>

40
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,000
operators what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need what you know</font>

41
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,420
how is it going to be useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you and</font>

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,070
the results are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not entirely as useful I</font>

43
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,770
think as many people would like it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

44
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:49,258
specifically the SNMP v3 user model is

45
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,479
entirely based on its notion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of its user</font>

46
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,369
database and there's no tie in to how

47
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,110
you manage your existing accounts you

48
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,369
can't tie it into radius you can't tie

49
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,430
it into many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other authentication</font>

50
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,840
mechanisms that you're using doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup</font>

51
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,310
and user management and key distribution

52
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,750
and all those kind of problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

53
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,500
you've solved in other environments it's

54
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,959
very difficult in snmpv3 it doesn't make

55
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,190
use of some of the long list of stuff

56
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,930
that you see there and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font>

57
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,609
over that again

58
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:18,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really briefly I'm not going to go</font>

59
00:02:16,609 --> 00:02:20,569
over all these blocks it's not important

60
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:21,890
this is the SNMP v3 architecture and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

61
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:24,798
most important aspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you need to</font>

62
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:27,170
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this is that it's modular the</font>

63
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:29,209
right decision that the architects made

64
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,608
in this is they made it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily to</font>

65
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,260
extend it so to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> how security</font>

66
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:35,780
works we only need to change one little

67
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,219
tiny spot we only need to add one little

68
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,019
blip it and everything else will work

69
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:40,250
including the access control mechanism

70
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:41,959
so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> change your thin occation</font>

71
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,090
without changing our access control

72
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:49,239
works and it's all going to work

73
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:52,430
magically that's the goal so first off

74
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,959
we are this is not SNMP v4 it's a minor

75
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,569
addition that's the most important thing

76
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,819
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to know and the goal is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

77
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:00,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply enable you to make use of your</font>

78
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:02,599
existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> account information that you</font>

79
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:04,939
already have available to you be that

80
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,069
radius or Leverett is you used it should

81
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:10,578
be fast to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the IETF which I</font>

82
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:12,260
know that that's a something you've

83
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:13,549
never heard of before but the IETF is

84
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,719
actually trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that more they're</font>

85
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:16,340
trying to produce lots of small

86
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,599
documents and whether they succeed or

87
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,879
not well this will be one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the test</font>

88
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,099
cases that's one of the early ones but

89
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,379
the real thing we need and the important

90
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:25,879
one at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom is we need your input</font>

91
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:28,310
we need to know is this good is this bad

92
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,260
do you want it if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't if you don't</font>

93
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,400
want it we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to weren't probably</font>

94
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:33,168
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the work or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll do it</font>

95
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,479
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the revenue if some people do</font>

96
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:37,579
and some people don't it's not

97
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:39,829
beneficial to make standards that you

98
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:43,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys don't use it does no good for</font>

99
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:44,479
anybody but it wastes time so here's a

100
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,858
real quick poll and this is the

101
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,489
beginning of the raise your hand part so

102
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:54,530
wake up everybody how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people use</font>

103
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:57,459
SNMP v3 today not many people there's

104
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,810
maybe 10 or so that should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> an aha</font>

105
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,720
that should be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign that uh-oh</font>

106
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,159
something's wrong either<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendors are</font>

107
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,459
implementing or you guys aren't using it

108
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,739
and why how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

109
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:11,180
authentication mechanism is too hard to

110
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:14,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">set up for v3 and that's one of the</font>

111
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,870
reasons why you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using it more</font>

112
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,750
people

113
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,550
would you use snmpv3 if it would tie

114
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:28,160
into your existing databases with that

115
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:31,630
you find that beneficial almost the same

116
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of people as last question so</font>

117
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">here's where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into the stuff that</font>

118
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,690
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting regardless of</font>

119
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,400
whether you use SNMP or not because I

120
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,650
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a show of hands of who uses</font>

121
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,620
what technology will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting this</font>

122
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,210
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird wacky creature</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

123
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,650
conglomerate of most of the O'Reilly

124
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:54,260
books on each of the different subjects

125
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:57,469
but so there's a there's a large number

126
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:01,789
of identification mechanisms that that

127
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:04,880
are in use today first off there's

128
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,260
there's a local account model user

129
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,480
accounts that actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist on the</font>

130
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,640
device whether that's a username<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

131
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,100
password possibly you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know run through</font>

132
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,140
crypt or whether that's SSH keys or

133
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,720
whatever else there maintained

134
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,770
individually on each device and my

135
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,540
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how many people make use of</font>

136
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,219
local accounts not SSH in this case but

137
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:29,270
local password accounts and things like

138
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,310
that a fair number this is on the device

139
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:34,219
not in a radius server how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

140
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:38,990
use SSH with public and private keys in

141
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:41,360
order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> login authentication more</font>

142
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:45,380
that's good you're using secure good

143
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,390
security that's good the the other

144
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">common one that that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is more</font>

145
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:53,690
widely used is things like radius and

146
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">tack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X plus where you have you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have your</font>

147
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:57,290
your device is actually talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an</font>

148
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,300
authentication server it's much more

149
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,340
scalable generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> because all those</font>

150
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,380
accounts can be maintained on a central

151
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,179
machine how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people are making use</font>

152
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:08,469
of either radius or tech X plus or a

153
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,740
similar technology that's what I thought

154
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,740
lots of people

155
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,250
there's there's a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an inverse of</font>

156
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,020
that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where there's a</font>

157
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,490
ticketmaster and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font>

158
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,919
hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> out tickets saying you're good to</font>

159
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">log in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the remote machine Kerberos is</font>

160
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,160
sort of the ideal technology for this

161
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,170
where you taught where the client

162
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,280
actually talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a ticketmaster gets a</font>

163
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,870
ticket and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then hands it to the server</font>

164
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,489
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server never needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to interact with</font>

165
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,950
the ticketmaster once the infrastructure

166
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:41,650
is set up how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people are using</font>

167
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:43,450
Kerberos in some way a couple finally

168
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:45,979
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> public/private key</font>

169
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,030
infrastructures beyond you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like SS</font>

170
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,420
agent<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I was talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about before</font>

171
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:52,940
these are real x509certificate

172
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,560
infrastructures the common usages of

173
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,200
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> over protocols that require</font>

174
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,660
TLS or SSL in order to validate

175
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,750
especially the remote server so HTTPS

176
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:06,170
things like that how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

177
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">using TLS SSL x.509 certificates</font>

178
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,310
somewhere in their network to do

179
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,050
authentication note that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does count</font>

180
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:19,790
authenticating the server not just the

181
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:22,340
user<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay fair amount so in order to fix</font>

182
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:23,420
SNMP so that the those of you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise</font>

183
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,390
their hand saying it would be beneficial

184
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,800
to do this there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of paths</font>

185
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:31,010
forward all of the work has actually

186
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,410
already been done to a large part it's

187
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,849
just picking one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> going forward so</font>

188
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the solutions actually already there</font>

189
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:40,010
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually deploying it through</font>

190
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:43,190
the IETF and writing code for it there's

00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">three that are candidates one is the</font>

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,690
session based security model which is

00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:49,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">written by myself and david perkins who</font>

194

david perkins is actually in the back if

195
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,550
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk to him later david once</font>

196

you stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a sec so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if people have</font>

197
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,630
questions up he's by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the watering by the</font>

Kerberos based solution which uses

00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,340
Kerberos note that in Kerberos you don't

202
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,990
have to use you can't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kerberos to</font>

203
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,310
other technologies like radius and

204
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,130
things like that that's not well

205
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,690
understood but you can i'm actually an

206
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:15,380
author<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this one too i'm competing</font>

207
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,850
against myself and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> available and</font>

208
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,950
has already been implemented in medicine

00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">ap5 point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh but that's the only package</font>

210
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,770
that implements it so you're not

211
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,520
necessarily likely to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> used it yet</font>

212
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:28,020
and then finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco is pushing</font>

213
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,359
another draft yet that has not been

214
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,490
published called us<font color="#CCCCCC"> m plus I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

215
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,159
the details<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it but their goal was to</font>

216
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,380
make it as close to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us em as possible</font>

217
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,630
that still<font color="#E5E5E5"> tie in radius so as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> close to</font>

218
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,969
the SNMP v3 infrastructure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see today</font>

219
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,529
but tied into other stuff be using the

220
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:48,470
same mechanisms I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fan of that</font>

221
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:50,610
one but it is a candidate so finally

222
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,880
questions and answers if you guys have

223
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,529
questions please let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me know I'll be</font>

224
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">available afterwards to talk and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so will</font>

225
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:59,220
david perkins there's a mailing list

226
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,709
started up within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF that you're</font>

227
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">welcome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to join if you want and there's</font>

228
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:06,479
a website if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the net-snmp</font>

229
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,300
website there's a link to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it from there</font>

230
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,279
to this website due to my<font color="#CCCCCC"> low bandwidth</font>

231
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,229
on my personal network is currently

232
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,640
redirecting you to net-snmp so don't be

233
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,320
surprised when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you end up somewhere else</font>

234
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,140
because I rehoused it for the purposes

235
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,110
of 500 people / doubting my own my home

236
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,540
network but please do fill out this site

237
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,959
it has more questions it's going to

238
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,399
enable me to take a better poll of

239
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,439
exactly how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think of what</font>

240
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,029
opinion there's some there's some more

241
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">detailed questions so that if I didn't</font>

242
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:36,450
hit your authentication mechanism you

243
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,279
can fill it in later and if we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

244
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,810
of requests for that type of mechanism

245
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:43,170
then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to make sure that that's</font>

246
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:49,760
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to achieve</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay anybody have</font>

247
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:49,760
questions I told you it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fast</font>
