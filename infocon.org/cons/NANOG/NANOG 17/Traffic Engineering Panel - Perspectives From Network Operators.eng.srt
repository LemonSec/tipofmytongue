1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
but I kind of suspect that's not the

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,359
case so you're saying is more difficult

3
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,919
if it's more difficult with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ATM</font>

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:12,030
network I think it's more difficult with

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:19,948
ATM networks any other opinion no

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:23,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience it is a much harder problem</font>

7
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:28,619
transitioning from an ATM from an IP

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:31,500
over ATM to an IP over mpls network the

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,800
problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have then to traffic</font>

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,850
engineered underlying networks which

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,910
don't know about each other the the MPLS

12
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:45,000
over ATM just doesn't seem to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be taking</font>

13
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,300
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> that much as far as I know the the</font>

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,199
implementations are just not there so

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:55,468
you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to build out to</font>

16
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,930
traffic engineered backbones that don't

17
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:01,170
know about each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other they're carrying</font>

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,850
different subsets of your traffic the

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,729
about the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I can see where that</font>

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,310
would go smoothly is if you timed your

21
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,679
mpls transition at the same time that

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,470
you were<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing basically a massive</font>

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:18,600
capacity upgrade that was going to buy

24
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:23,189
you the excess bandwidth to do this

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:26,009
sloppily it and then get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of the ATM</font>

26
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:29,579
stuff and convert your ATM links to

27
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:32,040
pause at that point but the two would

28
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to be done at the same time see I</font>

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,600
heard that a sin I get you that like

30
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,729
loop back around so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get the</font>

31
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,199
questions behind you because I'm getting

32
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:47,670
tired of looking a hobby<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one last</font>

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,340
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i saw that jason has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MPOs</font>

34
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,720
over ATM solution so based on what

35
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,549
you're saying do you think it's more

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,920
difficult to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that the issue</font>

37
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,140
there is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't happen to have</font>

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,360
ascend routers in your network and

39
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,890
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get rid of ATM you</font>

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,990
don't want to just buy them and then

41
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,460
throw them away a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> months later</font>

42
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,128
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you just use them for this</font>

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,869
transition so if it's just a transition

44
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,008
issue you want to be putting something

45
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,920
in your network that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

46
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:13,750
keep in your network

47
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,829
and more capacity is something that

48
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,660
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to keep in your network</font>

49
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,720
whereas ATM switches or something you're

50
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:22,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to throw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away so the people who</font>

51
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,790
are doing this sort of a transition are

52
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,760
very reluctant to buy new switch is just

53
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:35,799
so that they can get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them thank</font>

you to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best of my I'm sorry to the</font>

purports to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> mpls is actually what</font>

57
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">they call IP navigator which is to say</font>

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,900
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they actually do the one on router</font>

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATM switch so i think ascend</font>

absolution absolutely could they're very

<font color="#CCCCCC">intelligent people they absolutely do</font>

63

have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> capability to actually do</font>

64
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,620
interoperable mpls but to the best of my

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,230
knowledge they have an attempted to do

66
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,650
so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm sure there's some semi</font>

obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons why Joe hobby thank you</font>

68
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,600
I on the other hand could never tire of

69
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,670
looking at ed in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fellow panelists so</font>

70
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,100
I had a comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> in regards to a comment</font>

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Curtis made about traffic</font>

72
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,120
engineering especially when you have

73
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,738
fiber cuts one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that some</font>

people are doing now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people are</font>

75
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:25,239
going to be deploying as a stage between

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,280
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pure IP network and people</font>

77
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:29,859
who are considering mpls is using

78
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,079
Confederations as a method of doing a s

based you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know destination a s based</font>

80
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:36,459
traffic engineering so you can say I'm

81
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to honor meds you know over these</font>

82
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,420

83
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,280
if they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> down you know you get you can</font>

84
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,100
you know not on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our meds and just be</font>

85
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,180
carrying traffic over your own network

86
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,190
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any of the number of</font>

87
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,470
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get with mpls like the</font>

88
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,150
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to specify how big certain flow</font>

89
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,040
should be or even look at how big the

90
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,549
flows are but it is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

91
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,739
people are doing so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you take</font>

92
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:03,549
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at any topology and you try to do</font>

93
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:06,609
simulations of how well your load

94
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:08,889
balance would be after an arbitrary cut

95
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:14,799
in the network with that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

96
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:16,780
essentially an igp based technique and a

97
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,940
traffic engineer technique because you'd

98
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,369
find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your load balance was a</font>

99
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:24,880
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better with the traffic engineer</font>

100
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,680
technique if you sustained a substantial

101
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,270
fiber cut and you really needed that

102
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,699
capacity the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the difference which is</font>

103
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,169
quite significant would matter they

104
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:37,630
would matter to your customers and

105
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:39,400
therefore it would matter to you so so I

106
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,680
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd be better off with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MPLS</font>

107
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,229
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not saying that you don't have a</font>

108
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,630
workable solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> there but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

109
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:50,260
you'd be better<font color="#E5E5E5"> off with the MPLS an</font>

110
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:54,370
issue with mpls right now is doing mpls

111
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:56,469
across I GP boundaries II whether

112
00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:01,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're ospf area boundaries or whether</font>

113
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:02,830
they're if you have separate I GPS most

114
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,219
of the Confederations that are being

116
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,710
most of the networks that use

117
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,280
Confederations or at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm aware</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so that still remains an issue as</font>

far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as for as much money they're paying</font>

120
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,940
you think that have more mics here um RV

121
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,530
are you saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you transition to</font>

painful in some ways if you're not

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,239
running Confederations there's no really

127
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,880
elegant way to cut over but you can use

128
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,310
route maps at<font color="#E5E5E5"> inner Confederate sort of</font>

129
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,280
border and if you actually constrain

00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:48,520
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp to express different policies</font>

131
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,380
to say honor metrics from certain a esas

you know as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well to come in to this</font>

133
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,039
Confederation over these links but not

134
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,199
other lengths so that you won't even

135
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:57,810
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll have different metrics on</font>

the routes heard via different paths

137
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:03,940
I've been asked to ask you if you tried

138
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,889
this yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they can working does but</font>

139
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,810
that's not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know good for</font>

140
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:10,330
everyone some networks have a lot of

141
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,860
traffic that they use say to honor meds

142
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,870
to deliver traffic to other providers

143
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,639
and they don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be doing</font>

144
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,070
all that they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

145
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,930
hop into peering pipes so you know you

00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:22,479

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,919
being well when that happens without

149
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,280
some way to automatically rerouting mpls

you have enough statistics on your

160

if something like that were available

190
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,770
although I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess I don't really think it</font>

would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice if something like that</font>

192
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,099

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,049
would be nice if someone like in the ing

196
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:36,349
genre had developed a set of tools that

197
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:38,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">would allow you to make reports on path</font>

204
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:02,279
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tools were</font>

can ask them offline because they're in

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,929
our heads but<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly i was wondering if</font>

208
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:12,660
we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet avoid them but i can also</font>

00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:15,959
flame thanks that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> great hey look it's</font>

210
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,809
bill um yeah actually that was listening

211
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,878
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm kind of wondering myself based</font>

212
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:23,550
on you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience deploying this</font>

213
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,199
stuff would you say this at this point

214
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,410
we're sort of one hundred percent baked

215
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:30,389
75% bait fifty percent baked in terms of

216
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,368
being able to operationally in a turnkey

217
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:34,350
way deploy this stuff but my sense is

218
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:36,149
from the questions are asked earlier it

219
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,509
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be some work done on the</font>

220
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:42,569
interface into mpls configurations to

221
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:44,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">make this a truly easily deployable</font>

222
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:46,529
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was curious so that's your</font>

223
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:49,139
sense as well you're you're adding a lot

224
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:51,959
of tunnels depending upon your

225
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:53,999
deployment strategy and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> management</font>

226
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,660
of those tunnels can get very complex

227
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:59,579
and it's a difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to answer you</font>

228
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:03,749
know what tools are needed because to a

229
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:06,089
lot of extent that is dependent upon

230
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:08,850
your existing environment you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

231
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:10,740
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expand your existing you know</font>

232
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,839
configuration tools and that sort of

233
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:18,209
thing to cover this very easily you may

234
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:20,670
not for each network that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

235
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:22,888
at how its managed that is a major

236
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,679
component to your deployment and your

237
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:31,949
plan the the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mpls</font>

238
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:34,079
code works so that's ready don't confuse

239
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:37,199
just standard mpls with any constraint

240
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:41,069
based system because all that is you

241
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:42,990
know barely baked right so so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

242
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:44,459
does sort of you have that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

243
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at each environment differently and</font>

244
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:49,109
have to say what will this scale will

245
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,839
this be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support this and go from</font>

246
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,830
there

247
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think there might even be a bit of an</font>

248
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,790
underlying assumption here which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

249
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,520
you can get this to be easy I don't know

250
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,709
about you all but I'd imagine you all do

251
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,380
fairly well financially because you're

252
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:08,590
able to do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that others consider</font>

253
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,180
hard so I'm not proposing any sort of

254
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,670
collusion or anything but I don't think

255
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,979
that this stuff is really meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

256
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:19,599
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a while so certainly you want</font>

257
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:21,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make it easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but please don't have</font>

258
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,750
the assumption that if you buy the right

259
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">GUI from your vendor and if he tells you</font>

260
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,590
it's easy it'll just be easy once it's

261
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,580
got a GUI or not and I know you don't

262
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean that bill but I think a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

263
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,960
other folks sometimes have the mentality

264
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that gosh just give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me a GUI I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

and click at so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's easy and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really what the game</font>

267
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:40,750
is here yeah it will need to get there

268
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,300
but we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> there yet and it'll be a</font>

269
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,460
little while but you know it does mpls

270
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,900
significantly decrease the reliability

271
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,380
of an operational network today no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

272
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,380
don't think so

273
00:11:54,189 --> 00:12:01,160
any other questions any other questions

274
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:03,620
well I still have the one how do you see

275
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,300
the most as far as getting traffic into

276
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">the various tunnels whatever the tunnel</font>

277
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:10,279
speed mpls are otherwise just basically

278
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:12,529
by source by destination by type of

279
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:15,290
traffic all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vendors make a big issue</font>

280
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:18,410
of latency and I'm kind of curious as to

281
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:22,870
how important you guys think latency is

282
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,870
as far as getting that into a tunnel I

283
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:34,339
could burn them out so far mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

284
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,230
we've done is is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> destination based</font>

285
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:41,209
thing it'd be nice to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to do some</font>

286
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:45,319
source based stuff but that that's been

287
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:48,378
limited so far if you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

288
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:50,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">down a voice path you're going to need</font>

291
00:12:51,649 --> 00:12:57,769
hugs there as well and I think I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

292
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:02,748
touched on some of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my</font>

293
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:04,069
presentation I once told that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a</font>

294
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,559
strong opinion about something and he

295
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:09,199
said I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong opinions on everything</font>

296
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:12,860
and I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a strong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion about this</font>

297
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:15,949
which is that today certain a good

298
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:18,470
amount of interfaces have multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> cues</font>

299
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:21,219
so such that one can do a low latency

300
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,790
path so it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> apparent to me that</font>

301
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,829
certainly you're going to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

308
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,040
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really useful to back it up but</font>

309
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:41,989
anyway I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you in my opinion there's</font>

310
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,910
two two things you need the SPF

311
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,860
forwarding information to form the 14

312
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:49,870
equals a class and then as kind of a

313
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:53,019
parallel over that different

314
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:56,449
experimental bits so you can map your

diffserv bits if that ever works into

316
00:13:56,449 --> 00:14:01,099
the proper LSP and then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use</font>

317
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">that as your way so I don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

this way that are that are low latency

small network in my basement it's 12

349
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:29,029
don't know under 100 routers and the

350
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:30,839
other question relates to any tools or

351
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,819
projections for use of this technology

352
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,919

networks connected to a provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks</font>

354
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,689
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily see mpls is going</font>

355
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:42,299
across providers i see it basically is

00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:45,569
being with one with inside 1 i.jpg

357

358
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:52,049
run it multi provider or cross I GPS is

359
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:54,179
I think not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to scale for one and</font>

360
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:57,720
it's just gets to come to complicate it

361
00:15:54,179 --> 00:16:00,629
I view the mpls stuff more as a you know

I would probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up using it does</font>

that help

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:49,920
NE mpls across providers is probably a

382
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:52,920
long way out there may be used for mpls

383
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,310
across providers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has to be done</font>

384
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:58,290
in a scalable fashion which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

385
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:04,319
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> any way that has been discussed in</font>

00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:06,629

387
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,020
classification of traffic if you're

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:12,120
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through multiple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> providers</font>

389
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:16,319
as part of the MPLS stack but not pass

390
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:19,938
the path itself this has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done in a</font>

391
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,980
way that doesn't break aggregation so

392
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,660
there's been some thought put to how to

393
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:30,630
do that and but that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

394
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:33,030
long way off another in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ONP ospf OMP</font>

395
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,730
draft there's a the hint of providing

396
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:38,070
external information so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if somebody</font>

397
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:40,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you're adjacent to is a little</font>

398
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,178
overloaded and you couldn't care less

399
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:44,700
because you're very under loaded you

400
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,650
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do your customers a favor by</font>

401
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:50,760
taking the less loaded path for your

402
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:54,150
neighbor that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the OMP stuff isn't</font>

403
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,310
here yet so at all so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> also a long</font>

404
00:17:54,150 --> 00:18:00,030
way off so any any use of mpls across

405
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:02,370
providers it's a long way out I'm

406
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:07,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting the sense then that some of you</font>

407
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:09,928
folks see the MPLS stuff being used in

00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,220
then start looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at mpls today</font>

413
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:33,840
it certainly is in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't</font>

414
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:35,790
leave a static igbt apology but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

415
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">that one of the points that needs to be</font>

416
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:41,280
addressed or reminded or highlighted<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

417
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,440
guess is that if you touch an igp metric

418
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,440
here it's quite likely to have

419
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,210
far-reaching implications that are

420
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,230
somewhat difficult to model if you

421
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:53,670
change an LSP from point A to point Z

422
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,990
your set of affected variables is

423
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,420
constrained and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine what</font>

424
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:59,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the effects are a lot more easily so</font>

425
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,010
certainly they have to be used hand in

426
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,810
hand I wouldn't go so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far say we to an</font>

427
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:07,680
igp until we can't anymore and then do

428
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:09,360
constraint-based stuff but i'd say it's

429
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,680
a mix it gives you another tool which

430
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,389
adds complexity but gives you another

431
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:17,910
tool so you can decrease utilization

432
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:19,530
that's one on the back yeah I have two

433
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:23,100
questions by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the festival which was</font>

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:27,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned by curtis and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Andrew I would</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">assume the Tessera fast rule of which</font>

436
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:33,570
were the faster is because you do the

437
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,070
RSP prover pre provisioning and if

438
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:39,000
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will be the</font>

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,530
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the second question is</font>

442
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:53,820
that mean that I have to do provisioning

443
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:56,430
for every single possible link failure

444
00:19:53,820 --> 00:20:01,560
and you've got a case for a complex

445

about is one way when it more other

a research area at this point but the

456
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:28,970
stuff that haven't talked about is doing

457
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:32,209
I believe automatic automatic

469

it has to recalculate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

479
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,230
recalculation still happens so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

480
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,940
so fast we'd rather sort of use for a

00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,559
temporary hack to get around the path

482
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,029
and then and then you actually figure

483
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:20,139
out what the real new topology is and

everything set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> grease lot for the</font>

495
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about three ways that you can do</font>

496
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:51,820
restoration with an MPLS based LSP

497
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:55,539
topology the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first ways you can</font>

498
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:57,760
provision an LSP and if it breaks you

499
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:59,529
can tell it to go find another path or

500
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,419
you could tell it<font color="#E5E5E5"> nevermind you're dead</font>

501
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:04,110
use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp that's the first way that's</font>

502
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:07,360
simple that that's not particularly

503
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:09,879
rerouted<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the second way you can do</font>

504
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,299
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for each logical LSP you can</font>

505
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:15,730
provision a primary path and also

506
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:18,100
provision a backup path so you can go

507
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">from New York to San Francisco the</font>

508
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,090
northern route and the backup goes from

509
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,190
New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> to San Francisco the southern</font>

510
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,559
route that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second way the third</font>

511
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:28,899
way is what's generally I think called

512
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,789
fast rear out and to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best of my</font>

513
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:32,379
knowledge in production deployed

networks today only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first is done</font>

515
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,580
the second two aren't done but the third

516
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:40,149
way is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you'll do is between</font>

517
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:42,760
two routers like say for example Chicago

518
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:45,489
and Cleveland you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect the</font>

519
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,158
physical trunk with a backup LSP that

520
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:50,080
would go from Chicago down to Denver and

521
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,680
then over to Cleveland and what you'd

522
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,389
say is in the LSPs that

523
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,550
through this physical trunk that are

524
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,950
mapped onto this physical trunk if the

525
00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:00,500
trunk<font color="#CCCCCC"> breaks encapsulate them in this</font>

526
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">workaround LSP now this is good for a</font>

527
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,790
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reasons first if you think</font>

528
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,380
local to the ADM versus local to the

529
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:09,139
router it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a function of</font>

530
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:10,760
observing a problem and reacting so this

531
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,050
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hardware problem this is like</font>

532
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,150
something you can program on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router</font>

533
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:17,720
it's pretty reasonable to assume that we

534
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:20,060
can make routers or LS<font color="#CCCCCC"> ours do</font>

535
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,950
restoration as fast as ATMs because it's

536
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,530
a local<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware problem the second</font>

537
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:27,440
benefit you get is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey that guy in</font>

538
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,730
Chicago gets to think for himself so he

539
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,230
doesn't have to go all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way back to</font>

540
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">New York or all the way back to San</font>

541
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,500
Francisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> or wherever and say hey you we</font>

542
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,820
got a problem what you want to do

543
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,890
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got 30 milliseconds</font>

latency back there<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is he can</font>

545
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">act on his own and routed around so</font>

546
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:44,870
that's really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why folks</font>

547
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:48,380
believe that LSP ferry route can can go

548
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:50,479
faster than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sauna stuff I agree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

549
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,980
since we do not know when the failure

550
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,870
will occur right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

551
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:57,650
fiber will be taught so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

552
00:23:53,870 --> 00:24:01,189
you you have to pre provision a backup

553
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:03,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">ARS people ending primary RSP and yet</font>

554
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,360
you may have to provide a backup for a

555
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,670
backup well that's a real good point and

556
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,060
mr. Kern says<font color="#CCCCCC"> write a time so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

557
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it tonight</font>

558
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:21,699
well if we have a few minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so fast</font>

559
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:25,600
we're out well actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the restoration</font>

560
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:27,279
as I on point it out can happen in a

561
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,408
number of different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one is that</font>

562
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">you simply set up an LSP after the</font>

563
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:34,179
failure occurs there is quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

564
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,220
length of time there<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah the IGP or</font>

565
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:38,830
RSVP has to indicate back to the head

566
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,539
end that the LSB has failed and then you

567
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,470
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all the signaling to set up a</font>

568
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:47,408
new LSP the alternate is to provide a

569
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:50,049
backup LSP this this leads to a very

570
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:51,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult problem because if you provide</font>

571
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:53,679
a backup LSP and you reserve the

574
00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:00,309
network and there's work in the academic

00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:06,158
to try to find optimal algorithms

577
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:07,690
they're very difficult the other is a if

578
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,139
you do this static provisioning and you

579
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:14,260
do this offline you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the this is headend</font>

restoration and we're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

581
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,970
the other book form of restoration is to

582
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,970
restoration is to do the restoration at

583
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:24,309
the point of failure and since we're

584
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">running out of time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess I can't go</font>

00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:27,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">into that take it take it offline ticket</font>

587
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,418
could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company</font>

588
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:35,279
real quickly I wanted to take 30 seconds

589
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,450
to talk about the traffic engineering

590
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,059
working group that's now in the ITF

591
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:41,289
because I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have as much</font>

592
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:42,759
operational input as possible so I

593
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:46,059
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a few seconds to talk</font>

00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:50,169
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus of that working group it</font>

595
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:53,200
is about intra as2 doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

together all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know principles</font>

605
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:16,689
and requirements that we operators think

we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do traffic</font>

traffic engineering working group

610
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:33,689
meeting in in DC next month yes it is

611
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:36,639
just next<font color="#E5E5E5"> month for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those interested in</font>

612
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:40,809
giving their input as strong as it s you

00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:43,899
read the do some background reading into

614
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:46,479
this draft which you know goes back to

615
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:49,748
Joe and some other people Joe<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Daniel</font>

616
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:52,570
who I know Joe is here we were mentioned

617
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:56,049
earlier and then the mailing list at the

618
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:59,129
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom and that's pretty much it</font>
