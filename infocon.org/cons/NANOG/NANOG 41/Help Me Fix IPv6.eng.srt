be done to fix it but I can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

7
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:28,019
alone so ipv6 has been in development

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,598
for a long time has a few words<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some</font>

replacement we can't really fault the

12
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,620
ITF they're not operators but we do need

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,300
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something about it there's not a</font>

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:59,070
to be like a wafer thin mint as opposed

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:03,780
to a really big meal yes ipv6 has lots

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,820
and lots of bits but they aren't really

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,030
all usable for the kind of networking we

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,820
as network operators know how to do the

22
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,930
problem is one of the ipv6 features

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,449
which is mandatory for conforming

24
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:20,640
implementations on end hosts is auto

25
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,290
configuration and because it exists

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,330
people are likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to want to use</font>

chosen to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the interface identifier</font>

which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has a significant</font>

impact on the space that's available for

actual networks what is it you I 64 is

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:48,829
like a mac address only has got more

33
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:51,329
bits it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> originally intended</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

34
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:54,929
future developments where MAC addresses

35
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:57,570
needed to have a lot of more bits but

36
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:02,189
other than that the first 24 bits

37
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:05,908
between mac 48 and you I 64 are exactly

38
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:09,720
the same identifier it's a no you I what

uses it right now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Triple E 1394 and</font>

40
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,750
I'm not aware of anything else that

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually uses it from broadcast network</font>

42
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,520
why was it chosen well it was picked in

43
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,769
1997 because firewire seem to be the hot

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,000
new thing and in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it</font>

45
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,490
forward compatible and backward

compatible everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> should use UI 64</font>

47
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:33,000
what about what we're actually using

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,960
largely on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end networks these days</font>

vast majority of deployed end devices

53
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,700
the 16 bits have been wasted can't we

54
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,400
ignore autocom no it's mandatory and

55
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,410
that means because some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using it we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support it for</font>

59
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:15,690
what's the big deal well the unicast

60
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:20,820
base is only a / 3 not the whole of 128

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,060
SPS and ISPs have effectively a decision

00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,880
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can either give it a really</font>

effectively cutting their own throat

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,640
comparatively by not giving it as big as

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">bases their neighbor but if you give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

71
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,579
a big space you don't have much left

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:57,600
internally for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network allocation</font>

73
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:01,980
and aggregation what we end up with is

12 bits for a typical size is<font color="#E5E5E5"> P not one</font>

81
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:24,719
router slots are expensive we need to

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,790
minimize the prefix count for a long

83
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,160
time because the dual stack issue

84
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:33,590
we need to avoid having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> proliferation</font>

85
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:36,330
of ipv6 prefixes wherever possible

86
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:39,000
internal router slot use is also a big

87
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,340
cost so because that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

internal aggregation as a network

operator how is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> different from ipv4</font>

90
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:52,860
well ipv4 allocations to isps were never

91
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:56,010
done on a very long scale six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months and</font>

92
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,380
those were typically only the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> size</font>

93
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:01,080
up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you expected to use in that time</font>

94
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,150
it made it<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to allocate in a</font>

95
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,099
way that you could aggregate effectively

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:10,169
everybody is doing internal

00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,570
do internal hierarchical aggregation

otherwise everything just does not scale

107
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,070
what would be an ideal size for internal

108
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:42,900
aggregation about 20 bits how am i doing

ideally keeping it nibble<font color="#CCCCCC"> aligned for</font>

good reverse delegation 20 bits lets you

00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,300
do lots of levels of aggregation and

120

00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:45,990
that we nip it in the bud make the

we can overcome the momentum all I'm
