1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:09,269
excellent so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is jared montz so</font>

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:11,010
uh we had we have the case where there's

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,290
a lot of routing leaks that exists on

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">the networks right now and so I came up</font>

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,049
with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this way to analyze the s</font>

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,609
path and sort of figure out if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,859
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know basically highly likely to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

8
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:27,930
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was leaked or not so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do</font>

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,970
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I take a rib snapshot from 2914 I</font>

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,729
also go on I process all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP updates</font>

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,540
that are starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> at Marty format over</font>

12
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,489
at route views it because there's a lot

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">of data there which reveals a lot of</font>

14
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,239
stuff which we obviously don't see from

15
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,309
our networks perspective so what I do is

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,989
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a set of networks that have</font>

17
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:47,849
declared as quote quote major networks

18
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:52,980
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> argue whether or not they should</font>

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:54,660
be listed here but this is sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it's</font>

20
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,269
an evolving list and it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to</font>

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,059
be added on to and so what I do is I

22
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,239
look at what i do is i take the a s path

23
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,798
<font color="#E5E5E5">i undo the pre pens that are any pre</font>

24
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,330
pens that are in there and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i count</font>

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,220
the number of basically of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs</font>

26
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,439
there in that prior set in the a s path

27
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,570
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can look at that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,350
figure out you know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you come up with</font>

29
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,270
a score so the default score is that

30
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,850
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I use in the code is to anything</font>

31
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,990
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> two is obviously something weird if</font>

32
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,280
you've got more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> two of these major</font>

33
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">network ASNs in the path</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I go and I</font>

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,400
document some of the known business

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,860
relationships because obviously some of

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,259
those networks in that list do happen to

37
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">by transit so I go and I bump up the</font>

38
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,150
threshold by 144 every time I see you

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">know their asn and then they're up to de</font>

40
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,610
s n end of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the path and that that</font>

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,689
goes up over time so I've been

42
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,130
processing the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes since July</font>

43
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:54,449
just sort of passively I started

44
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:59,420
sticking in the database so i could do

45
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:02,159
queries so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far I've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know 360,000</font>

46
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">leaked events that I've found some of</font>

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,820
those are multiple views of the same

48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,740
event because multiple different people

49
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,060
are feeding the same view into route

50
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,190
view so the a s paths are slightly

51
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,050
different some of the things we have

52
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,829
noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weekend's tend to have a lot</font>

53
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,120
less know

54
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,680
ways people aren't tinkering with their

55
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,570
networks as much on the weekends so

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,680
there's generally less leaks on the

57
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:26,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">weekends I've also spent time emailing</font>

58
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,440
the networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I see in the involved</font>

59
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the leaks and about fifty percent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

60
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,359
them or probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more</font>

61
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:36,450
actually respond to it and are willing

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">to apply either an example policy that I</font>

63
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,540
give them on their routers to go and fix

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,310
the leak such that things aren't

65
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,650
happening happening so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

66
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,660
language barriers because I'm primarily

67
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,959
an English speaker and some of these

68
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,240
networks don't necessarily you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

69
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,280
operated English as their first language

70
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I've got this graph of leaks over</font>

71
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,750
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I didn't get the date stuff on</font>

72
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,350
the right this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of starts in the</font>

73
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:07,260
beginning of sometime in August and it

74
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,060
ended last night this sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of shows the</font>

75
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,739
leaks over time so it tends to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

76
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,570
tends to be a relatively stable amount

77
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,440
of noise and then a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

78
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:18,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">events that periodically have them so</font>

79
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,920
some of the major<font color="#E5E5E5"> events that i've</font>

80
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:24,030
noticed i sent an email out to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nana</font>

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,799
list back in August when<font color="#E5E5E5"> savvis leaked a</font>

82
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:30,060
large number of their peer routes from

00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:34,050
one peer to another the feed from route

84
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,630
views AT&T I believe they feed out of

85
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,250
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their labs or something which is</font>

86
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,100
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they leaked some of these</font>

87
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:44,940
the AAS pass with the private<font color="#CCCCCC"> esnz</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

88
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,920

89
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:53,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">and offend has leaked a large number of</font>

90
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:56,549
peer routes in the past so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font>

91
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,459
for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these leaks isn't that</font>

92
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,780
people aren't filtering in most cases

93
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,310
they're actually filtering their

94
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,500
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prefix list but what</font>

95
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens is you know it's it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um it's</font>

96
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">some small regional network in a lot of</font>

97
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,860
these cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has you know a</font>

98
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,450
downstream customer but they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

99
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">know two or three up streams and so they</font>

100
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,630
go and they end up you know their

101
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,130
downstream customer disconnects from

102
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,478
them and either temporarily because you

103
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,370
know that circuit goes down or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

104
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:26,460
and they end up learning the routes via

105
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,240
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their transit connections from</font>

106
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,859
from that

107
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,330
then they'll go and they'll propagate

108
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,490
the route because it matches their

109
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,800
prefix list<font color="#E5E5E5"> outbound to one of their</font>

110
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,940
other transit connections and so then

111
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,389
you end up with the case where you've

112
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,680
got you know some of these those leaks

113
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,569
going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's basically because</font>

114
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,310
they're not doing some advanced policy

115
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:45,750
where they local pref their customer

116
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,009
routes different from their peer routes

117
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,750
different from their transit routes

118
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:51,030
they're basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> just using the default</font>

119
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:54,060
you know in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases it's the cisco</font>

120
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,159
config and in some cases there's

121
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,580
outdated prefix list but that's that

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,319
really is more on you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the</font>

123
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,909
major networks I'd you know those

124
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,889
networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there because the people</font>

125
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:06,360
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always inform hey you know I lost</font>

126
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:09,750
this customer can you take that prefix

127
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,479
out of my prefix list ah so the

128
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,180
downsides to my to my technique is that

129
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously sometimes people change their</font>

130
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,389
business relationships they get a better

131
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,130
deal a dollar cheaper at mag or whatever

132
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:22,530
and so they shift their traffic around

133
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,539
so i periodically<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll have things pop</font>

134
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,919
up we're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually find one of those</font>

135
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:29,370
networks changes their transit

136
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,719
connections or adds a new transit

137
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,729
connection so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to go and document</font>

138
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,860
that in in my sort of exception list

139
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:36,810
that pumps up the threshold<font color="#E5E5E5"> i also have</font>

140
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,570
this blame technique where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i use where I</font>

141
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:42,539
look for the for a series of the major

142
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">network ASNs and then look for you know</font>

143
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I generally assume that it's a</font>

144
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,179
smaller provider that those networks are

145
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,830
