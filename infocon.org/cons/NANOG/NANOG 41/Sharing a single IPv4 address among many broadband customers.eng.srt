1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:06,029
hello for us we don't know me my name is

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,080
alondra<font color="#CCCCCC"> I work in the office</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the city</font>

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:13,139
with comcast could you talk today about

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:15,540
sharing potentially is many<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single</font>

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,509
ipv4<font color="#CCCCCC"> address among many customers in a</font>

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,279
pod<font color="#E5E5E5"> none deployment it's a bit of a</font>

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,410
disclaimer this is not something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,750
claim we are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing or will be</font>

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,320
doing is more like a research effort at

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:31,470
this moment so we have whole lot about

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">it the free pool of ipv4 addresses is</font>

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,510
running out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to eat us</font>

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,160
really bad so it'd have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been questioned</font>

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">but what will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do when there will be</font>

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,019
no more addresses to allocate to new

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,360
customers so some ideas about ok let's

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,260
allocate v6 only to customers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,260
done and maybe trans like this it to v4

19
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:55,769
problem is that people today in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the home</font>

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:59,820
network of tons of legacy devices like a

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,890
windows 95 98 even windows XP book

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,110
cannot survive in<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ipv6 only</font>

23
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,470
environment even windows XP cannot send

24
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,030
DNS requests of ipv6 transport so that's

25
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,240
that's a bit of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem we cannot</font>

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,360
ignore all those devices and on the

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,419
other side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the internet the web</font>

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,460
servers are all ipv4 today it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,840
take quite a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time before every</font>

30
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,570
single web server on the planet is

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">already too v6 so on one side you have</font>

32
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">legacy v 4 pcs on the other side you</font>

33
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,929
have tons of before web servers and was

34
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">to still need to communicate even when</font>

35
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,390
we may not have any v4 addresses to and

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,460
out to our customers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are in the</font>

37
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:42,420
middle and maybe we have some bits of

38
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:46,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">the solution it's kind of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> short</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> term</font>

39
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">Avenue before the world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> move to v6</font>

40
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,380
trying to enable those legacy devices to

41
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:55,500
stick connect you with legacy internet

42
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,679
no sense but<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not allocate one ipv4 us</font>

43
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,049
to every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single one customer try to some</font>

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,329
aggregate<font color="#CCCCCC"> VAT and allocate maybe one</font>

45
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,909
address / 100 customer or thousand

46
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,098
customer something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in Sydney</font>

47
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,679
produce v6 in the same time in the house

48
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:13,200
so that new application<font color="#E5E5E5"> can still use</font>

49
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv6 and forced of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these v6 deployment</font>

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,220
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about stalling v6 engines to</font>

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,959
v4 and so but yes getting v6 ready to be

52
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful for new application but still</font>

53
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:29,940
caring about the legacy so our to

54
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,030
implement this well we could start

55
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,190
provisioning some new customers only

56
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:39,450
with ipv6 so they do not consume any

57
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:41,910
ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> address and this could be sent said</font>

58
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,619
as this is a different tier of service

59
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,420
so if you really really want your own

60
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,920
ipv4 address and do not share it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

61
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,798
<font color="#CCCCCC">your neighbor maybe you will pay a</font>

62
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,569
little bit extra or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way around</font>

63
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:53,670
if you are willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share your address</font>

64
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:57,089
with your neighbor maybe you will have a

65
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,500
discount something like that so my

66
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,849
assuming that we are pieces that we can

67
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,769
upgrade it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in essentially the home</font>

68
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:05,700
gateway is a piece where<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to</font>

69
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:07,739
focus and assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

70
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,899
allocate prefixes to customer not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

71
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,690
64-bit something larger but we can do

72
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,280
things with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and essentially the idea</font>

73
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:16,170
is that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do a DAB on that</font>

74
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,250
so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the home</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that will be private</font>

75
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">before there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only a v6 global address</font>

76
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,299
so with translate this private before

77
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,459
into this global v6 send it somewhere

78
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:28,639
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your core our service provider</font>

79
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,650
network and translate it back into

80
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:36,180
global v4 and aggregate many customers

81
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:38,430
on this translation point NC low 56 as a

82
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,170
native service so I have a diagram

83
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">things like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picture is better to</font>

84
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,608
explain what this is all about so on the

85
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">left hand side orange this is before on</font>

86
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:50,400
the right hand side blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is v6 so</font>

87
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,380
you have this new home gateway which is

88
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,410
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some of the intelligence</font>

89
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,720
it will have a v6 only connection to the

90
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,970
service provider network it's only

91
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,410
provision<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a v6 address in that case</font>

92
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:07,290
this is the 2001<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colin something that's</font>

93
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,540
a prefix / 56 so it can distribute the

94
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,840
different subnets so all the v6 stuff is

95
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,060
will going native in the v4 stuff that's

96
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,820
allocated<font color="#E5E5E5"> in private aerospace of 192</font>

97
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,339
168 just as usual<font color="#CCCCCC"> so nothing will change</font>

98
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,500
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a user perspective and this would</font>

99
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,109
be translated so instead of translating

100
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,920
this into a global<font color="#E5E5E5"> before will translate</font>

101
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,810
this into a global v6

102
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,270
so from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that nothing really changed very</font>

103
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,520
much the translation is very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

104
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:37,289
is a one-to-one mapping between that

105
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,150
private before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that v6 address and</font>

106
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,250
we send this packet to essentially a

107
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,080
farm of translator<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will be</font>

108
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhere in the core of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the service</font>

109
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:51,490
provider and that will do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverse</font>

110
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:53,230
translation for my pv6 to ipv4 so the

111
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,390
trick to do that is of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> to embed</font>

112
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:58,270
the source and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the destination before to</font>

113
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,919
ass inside of a v6 packet but this

114
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,719
tricks that have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> used many many</font>

115
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:06,700
times so this is really not something

116
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:09,370
new one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenges to do that is</font>

117
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,289
how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> scale this form of translator</font>

118
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,030
because we cannot have just one

119
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:14,490
translator for a million<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or 10</font>

120
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,650
million customers is never going to work

121
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:21,610
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome to scaling is good any kind</font>

122
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:25,630
of any<font color="#CCCCCC"> cast is good we can also help a</font>

123
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:28,660
customer to discover this using some

124
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,940
kind of a dhcpv6 parameter so we can

125
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,640
tell this customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your farm of</font>

126
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,170
translator is there and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

127
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,360
hundred customers who are pointed to the

128
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,880
same place well essentially we can have

129
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,500
a hundred-to-one reduction of a number

130
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:46,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">of ipv4 addresses that are being</font>

131
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:48,970
consumed so here's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example so in the</font>

132
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:52,420
home gateway let's say that you want to

133
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:55,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">send a packet from 192 168 1 2 and you</font>

134
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:59,710
want to send it to an address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's 190</font>

135
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:02,440
8 10 8 150 I've taken up in the web

136
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:04,510
server from nano<font color="#CCCCCC"> gear well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> translate</font>

137
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,040
this into a physics packet so the source

138
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,620
of this packet is a prefix which has

139
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,120
been allocated<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you there's a bunch of</font>

140
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">zeros and then where is your source</font>

141
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:16,060
address over 192 168 1 2 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

142
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,970

the traffic going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the v4 internet</font>

151
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:46,900
and allocate a port and maybe a bit of

152
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:50,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">an IP address so that you can send the</font>

there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no magic is fairly simple not</font>

156
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:01,120
back to before and instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of allocating</font>

157
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,760
one address per customer you allocate

your addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this pool of</font>

translator miss form of translator and

160
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,969
you can have this reduction maybe under

161
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,840
21 or thousand to one depending on how

162
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:16,240
aggressive you want to be so some

163
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,710
special consideration while<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS which is</font>

164
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,020
like a new of our application can be

165
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,479
translated or you can have a DNS proxy

166
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,159
you've home gateway there's some issues

167
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,490
about MTU adaptation which is not really

168
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,710
something that has very troublesome I

169
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,539
mean we know how to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that of</font>

170
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:34,359
course will not work with every single

<font color="#E5E5E5">application but the opposite is you stop</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">growing your business so it's probably a</font>

173
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,490
lesser evil it's not really worse than

174
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,770
regular not today it's just that which

175
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,300
move a point where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nat is done from</font>

176
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:52,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">the customer edge to inside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

177
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:54,310
network kept a question that have been

178
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,580
asked to me many many times why not

179
00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,280
using tunneling instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT when we</font>

180
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:02,320
answer is that if you do it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

181
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,659
this external you're still in the v4

182
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,820
dress and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem I'm trying to</font>

183
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,280
solve I don't have a v4 address anymore

184
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,650
to allocate to every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer so</font>

185
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,460
tunneling is not going to help and I

186
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:18,070
cannot even<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a net10 address because</font>

187
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:21,849
in my network we run out of net<font color="#CCCCCC"> done two</font>

188
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:23,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago so any solution that says yeah</font>

189
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:27,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh yeah just use nathan is not going to</font>

190
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:31,300
work why not use double ipv4 nat well

191
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:34,270
exactly for the same problem the 10 is

192
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:38,140
too small so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i cannot simply use net 10</font>

193
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:39,579
here why not simply deploy v6 only in

194
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,569
the home and be done and just put in

195
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:45,910
neck BTW at the edge well if i<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d6</font>

196
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,720
only in the home all<font color="#E5E5E5"> was legacy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> device</font>

197
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:53,199
like windows 95 98 XP there will be dead

198
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,860
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i care enough about my customer</font>

199
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,860
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't want this to</font>

200
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:04,740
and what about the new v6 only<font color="#CCCCCC"> whores to</font>

201
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,960
try to reach Vavi for<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet well just</font>

202
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,710
take one problem at a time to Davos

203
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,150
devices do not really really exist so

204
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,740
there might be some solution based on

205
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:16,770
proxies but that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the topic for</font>

206
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,930
another talk so I think that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

207
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,029
slide so if a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to</font>

208
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,250
take them if you are interested we'll be

209
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:25,770

210
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:29,670
some vendors on how to create a

211
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:34,290
prototype for this we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> about one</font>

212
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:37,229
minute for questions hello Darryl this

215
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:54,199
enough if 240 / 4 was not painted the

216
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:54,199
