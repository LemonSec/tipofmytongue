00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,040
and provide the most advanced network

that we can do the research universities

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,619
and by extension serve the rest of the

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:21,390
of the community so quickly go over

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,189
about forty one years ago the three

major research universities in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michigan</font>

10
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,359
thought it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool if they</font>

11
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,500
could connect up their mainframes since

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,040
they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know how to do it</font>

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,110
they formed merit to do so merit during

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,739
most of its existence has been involved

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:43,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">with research and trying to push forward</font>

forward networking and internet working

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:50,730
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> our greatest cream claim to</font>

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:55,170
fame<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our involvement the NSFNET with</font>

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:58,589
MCI and IBM and one of the offshoots of

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:02,879
our work with the NSFNET was nano so in

21
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:05,430
1994 we started to sponsor nanog to get

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,189
the operators together to help make this

23
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,930
the internet work and that for those of

24
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,119
you who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested next month the</font>

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,900
NSFNET is celebrating its 20th

26
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:20,939
anniversary in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Washington DC and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> el</font>

gourmet attend we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that the</font>

28
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,758
we've also spun off a number of

29
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">different companies many of you have</font>

30
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:31,650
worked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> merit or worked with merit in</font>

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,570
the past so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is merits mission and</font>

32
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,299
we're nanog fits in is if you look in

33
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second half of our mission</font>

34
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:39,150
initiating and facilitating

35
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,679
collaboration and providing knowledge

36
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,210
and technology transfer through outreach

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,950
so so even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though the most of you are</font>

38
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not from Michigan and not that part</font>

39
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:54,240
of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> community one of the reasons that</font>

40
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:57,240
the board has merit in existence is this

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,240
outreach and knowledge transfer in this

42
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,770
fostering community and collaboration so

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,679
is a non-for-profit this is something

44
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we can do in a vendor neutral</font>

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,430
environment better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than people who have</font>

46
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,709
a profit motive and have to serve

47
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,290
serve their owners and make sure they

48
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:19,129
get a good return on investment so

49
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully you find nanog to be a</font>

50
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:23,268
valuable experience and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

51
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">little different than most of the vendor</font>

52
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:29,090
sponsored conferences so on the next

53
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">point is where we going to go from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

54
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,810
say we for 13 years we've been doing

55
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,250
some pretty neat stuff here in nanog

56
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,469
we've gone through some changes

57
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,209
everything goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> through life cycles</font>

58
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:44,849
ideas come into existence get rare very

59
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:47,310
popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the environment moves</font>

60
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:49,950
on those ideas are not as effective so

61
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,200
it's important for nanog to continue to

62
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:56,310
evolve to be relevant<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to provide</font>

63
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:59,969
value to you the community over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

64
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:03,120
couple of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nanog leadership has</font>

65
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:04,918
focused on how to run nanog how to work

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,829
through its relationship with merit and

67
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,650
how to run the organization I think it's

68
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:14,519
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> now for nanog leadership to focus</font>

69
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,650
on a vision<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the future and to where</font>

70
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,690
where are we going to bring nanog what's

71
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,579
it going to try and accomplish how is it

72
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,930

00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:24,180
there's been some discussion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on</font>
