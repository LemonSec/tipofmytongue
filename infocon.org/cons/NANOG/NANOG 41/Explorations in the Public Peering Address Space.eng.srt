1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:05,729
okay so this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on some</font>

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,919
ideas and some work actually did a

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,030
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago never really did</font>

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,849
anything with it because there wasn't

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,290
actually very easy to do back then but I

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">get access to some infrastructure that</font>

7
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,140
makes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little easy this time so the</font>

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,660
basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is there is this a public</font>

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,710
exchange<font color="#CCCCCC"> disappearing fabric this is</font>

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,480
where a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of routers may be</font>

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,849
connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to iniquitous or switching</font>

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,050
data or d6 or any other of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dozens of</font>

13
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:33,690
exchange is what we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to do is</font>

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,750
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's pairing with who on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

15
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,849
public exchange fabric and so what you

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it and it's not anything</font>

17
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,110
that's not obvious but you get behind

18
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to figure out</font>

19
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,940
who has peer relationships with others

20
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,239
and do Trace routes and if you can trace

21
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,309
route to one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public pier</font>

22
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,760
addresses and get a response you can

23
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,559
presume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their peer and so</font>

24
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,349
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course you have to go find out all</font>

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,940
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> bedros blocks that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the exchange</font>

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,830
uses and you have to somehow get behind

27
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,939
all these networks to build this graph

28
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,950
so one easy way to do that is to use the

29
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,949
the pairing<font color="#E5E5E5"> DB there's a list of</font>

30
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,710
approaching 200 exchanges in there and

31
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,090
there's at least 125 prefixes that you

32
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,119
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them which are mostly</font>

33
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,820
twenty-fours but there's some / 19 s and

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,060
some 25 s and some s'mores and then you

35
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,889
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of remote hosts which may</font>

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">be easier for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some than others</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,810
access to a number of machines around

the net on different providers and as

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,640
well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the there's a nice tool kit that</font>

40
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,619
you can use the script route which is

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,189
essentially kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of based on the planet</font>

42
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:49,590
lab infrastructure and you just launched

43
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:51,148
a ruby based tools and commands and they

44
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,189
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything I'll pre-built for doing</font>

46

your trace route using any of the

servers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are part of the scripture</font>

48
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,860
out of network so you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind</font>

49
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,779
those networks or at least a great deal

50
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,890
of them and then you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your traceroute</font>

51
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,270
output and then you start parsing

52
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,660
through that and then see who's actually

53
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">cured so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did that and i just used</font>

54
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,920
speakeasy because that was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

55
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">first ones like I</font>

56
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,519
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to graph for this top and so I</font>

57
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,630
discovered that at the five major

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">equinix locations this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what their</font>

59
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,840
paragraph looks like so they were the

60
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:26,380
center and all the nodes that the edges

61
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:29,020
are people there appeared with now the

62
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">work that i did is maybe not exactly I</font>

63
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,870
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> rover giris in doing this so if</font>

64
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,760
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> from speakeasy is looking at</font>

65
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,880
this and sees the numbers are slightly

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,069
off that maybe my name is some here and

67
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,420
there in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact one of the things I</font>

68
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:42,130
discovered<font color="#E5E5E5"> right away is that there</font>

69
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,869
there was five that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> arrived at the</font>

70
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:46,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">green X exchanges here in North America</font>

71
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,110
they list for on their appearing page

72
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,370
and they list for and appearing to be

73
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,350
those two sets of four are not congruent

74
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,420
so this is maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice way to actually</font>

75
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of verify your configuration or</font>

76
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,350
someone else's configuration<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

77
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,929
find<font color="#CCCCCC"> out where were people out who their</font>

78
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,280
period with so then you can go further

79
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,410
and you can do an entire exchange

80
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,450
peering Ralph so if you can get behind

81
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,980
enough networks you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually start</font>

82
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:11,649
to build up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see who really peers with</font>

83
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,410
who and depending if you can get in

84
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,760
behind enough networks and watch enough

85
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">tracer outs and do the analysis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

86
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,780
you could build<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like this this</font>

87
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">is again this is a sample</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not</font>

88
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,950
everyone at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> equinix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ashburn but it's</font>

89
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,328
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a subset of some networks and</font>

90
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,238
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're connected to and some fairly</font>

91
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:32,920
significant ones like 80 and hurricane

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,480
and some others and so that may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

93
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,339
obvious question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is then you know is</font>

94
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">this something that we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

95
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,680
do is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it a bad</font>

96
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:43,959
thing is the you know how how is this

97
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,180
possible why can you actually do this so

98
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,010
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my experience and just looking</font>

99
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this sort of tangentially is is that</font>

100
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,750
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network's we're at these</font>

101
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,880
exchanges at least tend to advertise

102
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,799
those exchange net blocks within their

103
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,090
own network so internally so if you're

104
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind with those networks you can get</font>

105
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,560
to those public addresses at the

106
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:04,780
exchange a few do seem to announce them

107
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,549
publicly into customers or peers for

108
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,700
some reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know exactly why</font>

109
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:11,940
this is my<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess is that maybe default</font>

110
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,670
configuration of the we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just reconnected</font>

111
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:17,350
perhaps I actually inquired one of the

112
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,089
networks this afternoon about why they

113
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,579
do that and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> get so cannot answer I'm</font>

114
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:25,349
not clear on why

115
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:27,180
but currently they said it was as a as a

116
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:29,039
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their customers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't</font>

117
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,300
know why any customers will want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

118
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:36,090
the public address space that was their

119
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,319
answer I think they didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

120
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:39,448
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time to actually want to spend on</font>

121
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,740
this and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't blame them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so do we</font>

122
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">care about this you know I don't know</font>

123
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,169
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is maybe just sort of interesting</font>

124
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:48,530
but isn't necessarily a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad thing I</font>

125
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:50,580
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe it's not so much but</font>

126
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,719
opens up some possibilities for

127
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,609
something may be interesting to people

128
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:59,550
to work on maybe it makes some certain

129
00:04:53,610 --> 00:05:01,259
attacks more possible or enable some I'm

130
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost done if you can you wait once i</font>

131
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:06,180
get trial so it may be enable some sorts

132
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,430
of attacks may be Geographic based

133
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,009
attacks so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> North America this may not</font>

134
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">be such an issue because we have lots of</font>

135
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:15,509
exchanges and lots of lots of places<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

136
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,520
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> for smaller markets this may be an</font>

137
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:20,340
issue so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people may be concerned about</font>

138
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,870
enumeration of privacy issues obviously

139
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,388
<font color="#CCCCCC">this might be neat for researchers to</font>

140
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,620
actually understand topology better

141
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:27,419
maybe certain exchange operators may

142
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,279
want to do market research maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

143
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,389
necessarily on their own exchanges but

144
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,659
to see how they compare to other

145
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:36,020
exchanges and maybe they were hire

146
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:39,060
someone to do surveys<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us like this</font>

147
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:42,599
you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> even be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out where</font>

148
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,900
you actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go in and peer at</font>

149
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:47,128
based on building these sorts of maps

150
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,989
and then lastly something Danny

151
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:51,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Macpherson pointed out to me sort just</font>

152
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">made it in time for the slides</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's this</font>

153
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,800
may enable easier stealing of transit if

154
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,810
you can get if someone is actually

155
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,610
advertising this public address space

156
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,500
either globally or from than their

157
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:03,629
network maybe it is set up a tunnel and

158
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,650
actually use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that facility to actually</font>

159
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:12,240
use their use that to actually transit

160
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:14,849
through those pairing addresses not

161
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">having use your own and so just a real</font>

162
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:17,339
quick I'd be interested if anyone

163
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,690
actually thinks this is sort of

164
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:22,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">worthwhile where I should spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any more</font>

165
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,339
time on this or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't athis is</font>

166
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,310
or if you'd want to see like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dwayne</font>

167
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">wessels kind of maps on the source they</font>

168
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,510
can maybe animations about

169
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,460
you know how peering evolves over time

170
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,320
just made a quick show of hands is sort

171
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,700
of interesting maybe some want me to or

172
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,270
have someone actually do more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

173
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:42,950
maps or rafts just<font color="#E5E5E5"> any value not so much</font>

174
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:47,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay someone have a question over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our customers about why they are</font>

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:55,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">announcing the exchange subnet and</font>

178
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,299
they've at one answer which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

179
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">accepted from them is that they announce</font>

180
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,060
only to their transit customers to

facilitate a<font color="#E5E5E5"> trace route that the</font>

183
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:10,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is some kind of bad</font>

184
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:12,630
stuff going on at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exchange interface</font>

185
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,080
so that their trays alpaca to get back

186
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:18,090
to them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well thank you this is</font>

187
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,409
derived from recommendations in about

192
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,650
recommendations made by a group out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

193
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,230
group of backbone operators for how to

operate<font color="#CCCCCC"> at an exchange point which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

195
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:43,440
announce the exchange point fabric down

196
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:45,780
not to pierce<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and is it may be also</font>

197
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,490
useful bothering to imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> canticle</font>

198
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,200
beta monitoring their thirst I mean your

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">network and your customers want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but you don't want to enhance it</font>

201
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,990
appears they should be announcing it to

202
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,700
their cultures some people do seem to

203
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,040
announce a globally in certain cases and

204
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:03,510
certain exchanges seem to be better

205
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:05,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it than others but thanks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>
