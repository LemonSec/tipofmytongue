1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:08,550
hi first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to</font>

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">encourage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you all that you do ask</font>

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,460
questions and interrupt me if you have

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,199
anything you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to comment on one of</font>

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:24,769
the purposes of giving this presentation

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:27,180
is that sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I'll start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over again</font>

7
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:30,119
what I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say is that you</font>

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,510
please interrupt or comment or

9
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,040
afterwards on the presentation as my

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,960
main reason for giving the presentation

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,879
is that I need feedback and I would

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,420
really love to hear what other people

13
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:51,360
have experienced regarding integrating

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:55,590
networks so yeah the background for this

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,360
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in 2004 our company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TDC that</font>

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,910
some of you might know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> atilla Denmark</font>

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,769
acquired song networks the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Scandinavian</font>

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:07,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">network which was a s 3246 and we</font>

19
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,510
decided relatively fast that the two

20
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:14,009
networks were supposed to be merged into

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:18,330
one network in order to provide support

22
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,920
for products all over the area and the

23
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:26,070
main product that we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support</font>

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:28,290
was layer three big mpls VPN yep which

25
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,070
were the main reason for requiring not

26
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:35,729
work in the first place so how do you do

27
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:38,309
that we had two networks though both

28
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,579
running is is as a GP they were using

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,780
vtp for VPN and<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet routes so it</font>

30
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,899
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a pretty straightforward</font>

31
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,390
thing to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> just merge the is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

32
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,890
domains change the a is numbers on the

33
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,070
peas and the peas and the line

34
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,360
configuration and all we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all done</font>

35
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,529
should be done<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a couple of months and</font>

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:03,899
we'll all be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very happy this was back in</font>

37
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:05,610
2004 please so the world does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not look</font>

38
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're out in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the real</font>

39
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,480
life the acquired<font color="#CCCCCC"> network consisted of</font>

40
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,350
four areas which was basically spread

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,200
out on four

42
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:19,370
scandinavian countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> each operated and</font>

43
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,739
designed by local group of engineers and

44
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that we acquired that network</font>

45
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:28,740
did not change the fact about who were

46
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:32,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">engineering and running the networks at</font>

47
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,350
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in the beginning so for each</font>

48
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,820
of these four areas we had a different

49
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,489
set of issues that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take care</font>

50
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:41,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">of in order to integrate the networks</font>

51
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,830
and a couple of examples is that in one

52
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,870
area we had basically two parallel

53
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,530
networks that was made spanning the same

54
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:52,680
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> running each of different a s and</font>

55
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,930
different customer configurations and

56
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,830
all that kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing other areas</font>

57
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:01,320
consisted of<font color="#E5E5E5"> old types of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nair of the</font>

58
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,890
equipment that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would not support our</font>

59
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:08,700
security requirements and so on and so

60
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:11,700
forth so that meant that each area had

61
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,790
their own specific issues to take care

62
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:21,089
of so we could not do like a big bang

63
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:24,019
integration in one step so we came up

64
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,970
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a plan that finds some way to split</font>

65
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:29,880
part of the network of the acquired

66
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:32,760
network from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of it and then do</font>

67
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:36,000
a integration of that part that was

68
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,679
split out and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was done and</font>

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,340
over we could start<font color="#E5E5E5"> on working on the</font>

70
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:49,110
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so that was what we were trying</font>

71
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:53,400
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so but in order to get</font>

72
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:57,630
started on on this one we needed to get

73
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:01,470
the MPLS layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three product layer three</font>

74
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,600
VPNs working spanning the two different

75
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">a SS and the two different networks</font>

76
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,150
before we could sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get started on</font>

77
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:13,769
working on the integration so that's

78
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:17,459
what we call the RFC 40 40 40 364<font color="#E5E5E5"> jump</font>

79
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:21,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">start so that was how how do we make the</font>

80
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:24,479
customers VPNs in the two networks talk

81
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:26,419
to each other so we could use the option

82
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,969
a

83
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,380
option would which is to connect the we

84
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:34,630
are asked in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two different networks</font>

85
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:38,810
by setting up a back-to-back connection

86
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:42,020
so we started out doing that but if you

87
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:45,620
guys should start out and try and learn

88
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:48,710
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do this it seems</font>

89
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:53,570
like easy and simple but when you're

90
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:55,250
going to merge into sorry when you're

91
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to change the configurations back</font>

92
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,360
because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have integrated your IDP or</font>

93
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,609
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the option</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> C thing that</font>

94
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,610
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about you have a</font>

95
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:09,140
hell of a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pain by migrating the</font>

96
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:12,520
customers believe me instead we will

97
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:17,090
recommend that you use the option<font color="#E5E5E5"> C</font>

98
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:20,570
option to connect mpls networks and in

99
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,640
short that dip<font color="#E5E5E5"> consists of you have a</font>

100
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,010
GBP sessions where you send label on

101
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,190
border routers between the two networks

102
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:31,640
so that will give you mpls lights which

103
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:33,260
passed from end to end from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1p in one</font>

104
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,750
network to the Pease in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

105
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:38,990
networks and then you have a p2p

106
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:41,270
sessions between your VPN router

107
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:47,030
reflectors in order to exchange the

108
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:50,510
customers routes so next we will try to

109
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:53,359
go through on how can you do that and

110
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:56,539
here's a little drawing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the two</font>

111
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,840
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> options so on top we have the</font>

112
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:03,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">option a connection where each vref that</font>

113
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:08,060
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect or each to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vrf you</font>

114
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:12,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to connect one in the 3246</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AS and</font>

115
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:15,110
one in a 30 to 40 92 layers you need to

116
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:20,710
configure the customer on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the link</font>

117
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:23,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">between the two networks in the option c</font>

118
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:26,239
case you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to have the option c</font>

119
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:29,470
connection established and then you get

120
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">things done automatically</font>

121
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,370
yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the details</font>

122
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,750
about how you make an option<font color="#CCCCCC"> C</font>

123
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:46,470
connection what it consists of is that

124
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:48,120
you you use ebgp to signal the loopback

125
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,630
addresses and the labels for the

126
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,010
loopback addresses between the two laces

127
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:55,830
and then when you receive the loop bags

128
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:59,030
you redistribute them from btp into your

129
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:01,979
is is or whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do p you're using</font>

130
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:05,700
need to enable mpls forwarding on the

131
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:08,310
links between the two networks and then

132
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,070
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> created the possibility to have</font>

133
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,940
the light switch path from one PE to

134
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,500
another PE in the tune<font color="#E5E5E5"> and words</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

135
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">will be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to switch traffic on the</font>

136
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:24,660
link as well which is minor detail you

137
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:27,420
want to make sure yeah so we are going

138
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,850
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual configurations of</font>

139
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:36,270
this and please interrupt the comment if

140
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:44,250
you have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those things yeah first</font>

141
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:47,099
for your yeah this is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

142
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:49,350
your loot bag addresses into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp so</font>

143
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,650
you can actually send them to the other

144
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:56,520
network I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the dots in the</font>

145
00:07:52,650 --> 00:08:00,679
they were supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be removed on the</font>

146
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:04,349
slide so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have your router bgp</font>

147
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,480
configuration and we have the this the

148
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:12,660
the statement to redistribute is I is

149
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:14,130
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> two route map into bgp I will drag</font>

150
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:19,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">my lease on the next slide and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then you</font>

151
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:21,540
have a neighbor where you announce your

152
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:24,240
announce your<font color="#CCCCCC"> bdp and then you accept</font>

153
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:27,480
something from your peer and then don't

154
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,610
forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send label statement which is</font>

155
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:32,010
the one that will make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

156
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,460
actually send the labels to the other

157
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,460
network

158
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,339
yeah and also when you're doing this you

159
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:46,160
have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very careful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about doing the</font>

160
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:49,040
route right route maps and prefix list

161
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,410
so be careful that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do not read this</font>

162
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,540
book your own Ayodhya sloop backs into

163
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:59,389
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> ibgp because then you get a lot of</font>

164
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:02,719
them routing mess and loops going on so

165
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:06,110
here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the route maps which</font>

166
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:11,329
basically just is a prefix list of your

167
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:13,880
loopback offenses and the inbound route

168
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:16,399
map is where you would accept all your

169
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:19,850
loopback addresses from your peer and

170
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:23,930
you will also<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept the labels from the</font>

171
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:26,720
pier<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the outbound without a road map</font>

172
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:29,719
is that you send your loopback addresses

173
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,130
and that you set the labels and send the

174
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,920
labels as well over the btp session and

175
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:40,279
then below as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to see the</font>

176
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:44,300
last lines<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope so the last lines on</font>

177
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:54,410
the slides are just little back prefect

178
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:57,019
lists so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so now we have sent we</font>

179
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,939
have sent the little black dresses to

180
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:02,029
the other network and now we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

181
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,550
receive loopback advances<font color="#CCCCCC"> so DBP session</font>

182
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:07,910
and how do we these to build it into<font color="#CCCCCC"> iOS</font>

183
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:11,319
is we do that under your wrap your eyes

184
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:14,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">is statement and then you yes</font>

185
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:17,300
redistribute the route map again you

186
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,579
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be completely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure about which</font>

187
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,229
addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you want to redistribute in</font>

188
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:22,910
which addresses do not want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

189
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:27,529
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have all the prefix</font>

190
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:29,480
list stuff going on and also just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

191
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:30,920
safe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a small precaution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

192
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,220
do not reduce to build more than

193
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,010
thousand prefixes so in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an arrow</font>

194
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,760
we do not take the whole bgp table and

195
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:46,209
redistribute into our eyes eyes strongly

196
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,209
advise not to do that yeah

197
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:56,569
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an output of the routing</font>

198
00:10:53,690 --> 00:11:03,110
table trying to show an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ib PP on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

199
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:06,140
on an loopback address from our peering

200
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:09,680
network and we see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are getting</font>

201
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:11,720
the address from the I options he

202
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,680
connections and we have the next hop is

203
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,630
a is the link address and then most

204
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:23,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">importantly we see that we have labels</font>

205
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:26,990
on that route<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the external link and</font>

206
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,660
here is the same you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the show IP SF</font>

207
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:32,870
and the main point of this slide is to

208
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:38,589
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have labels on the road so</font>

209
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:43,160
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> label switched over the interface</font>

210
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:45,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so that was the configuration so how</font>

211
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:51,020
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually do the whole process of</font>

212
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:54,520
splitting up the acquired network so we

213
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:57,290
are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and an illustrate this</font>

214
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:00,290
if you have a look at the drawing we

215
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:03,800
have the white routers that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3292</font>

216
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:06,949
routers and the colored routers are 3246

217
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,430
routers and the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> split the</font>

218
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:13,040
yellow routers out and integrate in

219
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:17,569
order to be able to integrate them I as

220
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,779
is NBD p wise so we call the yellow for

221
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:23,720
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 and the blue routers are area 1</font>

222
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:29,390
and those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the part of the remaining</font>

223
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:34,250
network so in the beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

224
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:36,050
operation we have a connection we

225
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,029
already have an option<font color="#CCCCCC"> c connection</font>

226
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:41,479
between the white network and the blue

227
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:45,260
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two areas are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still connected</font>

228
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,990
with is is links and we have a transit

229
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:55,730
connection from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pier router to the</font>

230
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:57,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">blue network and why do we want to do</font>

231
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,560
this so we want the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pair</font>

232
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:05,510
it is to split it into two ayahs<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

233
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:09,829
domains so we could be able to flush<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

234
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:12,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">run so we were able to flush the is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

235
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:16,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">LS piece that we do not need in that</font>

236
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">area that needs to be integrated and</font>

237
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:21,140
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this was that</font>

238
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,880
we also had authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues in</font>

239
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,490
parts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network that needs to be</font>

240
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,890
fixed so this part that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> split</font>

241
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,170
out to integrate in the first in the

242
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:35,330
first operation does not have those

243
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:39,079
issues and then good advice<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want</font>

244
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:41,260
to do this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lower your LSP lifetime</font>

245
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:52,060
otherwise you can wait quite a long time

246
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:54,770
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the whole table flushed okay so</font>

247
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,290
this is the next step<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the operation</font>

248
00:13:54,770 --> 00:14:00,590
now what we do is that we established a

249
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:04,760
link from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray the thirty to ninety</font>

250
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:07,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">two routers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the yellow area and on</font>

251
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:11,030
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one we configured two vlans because</font>

252
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:14,210
it was a ethernet link on one wheel on

253
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:16,370
we made a pure IP transit connection and

254
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:19,490
are the other one we configured an

255
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:23,960
option<font color="#E5E5E5"> c connection and on this locked</font>

256
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:26,450
in c in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the direction from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yellow to</font>

257
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:30,830
the white they signaled all their loop

258
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:34,760
box just from the yellow<font color="#E5E5E5"> area and labels</font>

259
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:36,980
with them and in the direction from the

260
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,400
white network to the yellow a network we

261
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:44,330
would also signal not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the loopback</font>

262
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:48,980
addresses from the 3292 but also the

263
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:55,100
look-back addresses from the area one

264
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:56,870
that is the blue area similarly we would

265
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,120
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the configuration on the existing</font>

266
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:03,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">option c between the white part of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

267
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,940
network and the blue so that on top of

268
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,360
the white loop<font color="#E5E5E5"> backs we would also</font>

269
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,230
signal loop backs from the area to that

270
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:16,460
there's a yellow

271
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:18,500
part of the network and from the blue

272
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:19,760
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the network we would only signal</font>

273
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:29,860
the loopback addresses from that

274
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:33,530
particular part of the 3246 network so

275
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:37,250
yeah that was what idea so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know now</font>

276
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:43,459
we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation that we have split</font>

277
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:47,720
out the signaling so that on the top

278
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:49,250
link we had only a on the loopback

279
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,680
addresses from the yellow part we

280
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,180
exchanged on that on that connection and

281
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,319
only the loopback address is from the

282
00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:00,620
blue part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network was the chains</font>

283
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:03,650
exchanged on the on the link<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the</font>

284
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:07,880
white and the blue routers so in this

285
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:10,579
situation raising the metric on the link

286
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,750
between yellow and blue on the direct

287
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">link between the yellow and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blue</font>

288
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,570
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network would then cause the</font>

289
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:22,370
traffic to the MPLS which<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic to</font>

290
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:24,980
move to the links and go over the 3292

291
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:30,770
part of the network which is following

292
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:33,620
the green route on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> drawing so that</font>

293
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:35,689
made a quite a smooth transition of the

294
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,420
traffic between the two parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

295
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,840
network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could have now shut down</font>

296
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,829
the is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> linked without causing any</font>

297
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:51,379
packet loss or anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

298
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:54,439
customers yeah

299
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:57,049
so after shutting down the link<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

300
00:16:54,439 --> 00:17:01,429
the two parts what we needed to do then

301
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:04,429
was this to wait for the lifetime of the

302
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:09,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">ls piece to time out so we have we were</font>

303
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:10,819
sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we only had the LSB that we we</font>

304
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:13,009
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network before we</font>

305
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:18,319
could shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> down the option C and</font>

306
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:28,610
configure is is on the link and then we

307
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:31,580
were done<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay oh yes oh just to make</font>

308
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:37,219
sure we<font color="#E5E5E5"> kept the tragic connection</font>

309
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:40,549
between yellow and white in order to

310
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:44,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep the traffic there so how does</font>

311
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:46,309
traffic run now we have only talked

312
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,019
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the MPLS traffic so far but how</font>

313
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:52,279
does internet traffic run in this

314
00:17:48,019 --> 00:17:54,259
situation between the two guesses and

315
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:58,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">between customers in the two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> assn</font>

316
00:17:54,259 --> 00:18:02,330
between customers in thirty to forty six

317
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:06,559
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet traffic between thirty to</font>

318
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:09,168
forty six customers in area 1 and in

319
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:12,470
area 2 and between customers in one of

320
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:18,049
the area and<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IX in one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the two</font>

321
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:20,809
areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> would all go over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the LS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PS and</font>

322
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:25,269
that is over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the is I knew is is linked</font>

323
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:25,269
and over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old Oh option C connection</font>

324
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:35,809
internet traffic to customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an</font>

325
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:37,340
yellow area would go via the transit

326
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:40,490
connection that was on the UH new I

327
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:43,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">Assize link and in blue area there would</font>

328
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:46,129
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> no chains internet traffic would go</font>

329
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:52,969
the way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> always had gone be too over</font>

330
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:56,209
the transit connection so the

331
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:58,029
interesting part could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet what</font>

332
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:00,889
happens when you start actually

333
00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:04,750
converting p routers in the yellow areas

334
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:09,370
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new a s 3292</font>

335
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:12,460
so we now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a gray router up in the</font>

336
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:15,969
corner in yellow in the yellow network

337
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:19,930
and they just now convert it to 3292 how

338
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:21,550
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic flow then well ordinary</font>

339
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:24,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet traffic and traffic between</font>

340
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:27,220
customers in the rest of the 3292 just

341
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:33,070
flows over the is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no problem and no</font>

342
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:35,920
change in that also traffic to customers

343
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:38,470
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blue area which is flow over the</font>

344
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:42,690
transit connection because that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

345
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:47,010
a different areas now but traffic

346
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:50,290
between a internet customer on the

347
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:52,629
converter browser and an internet

348
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:55,270
customer on a PE router in the yellow

349
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:58,810
network we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful what we do</font>

350
00:19:55,270 --> 00:20:02,770
here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case we have to leak more</font>

351
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:05,110
specific 3246 routes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the converted</font>

352
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:08,110
router otherwise we would have the

353
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:12,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">traffic follow the red path which is rap</font>

354
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:15,179
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't want that gives in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

355
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:20,200
case we did not leak the more specific

356
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:22,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">we would go and send the traffic to the</font>

357
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,490
aggregates that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is announced on the</font>

358
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,680
transit connection to the blue network

359
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,750
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would move into the</font>

360
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,760
blue networker<font color="#E5E5E5"> and use the option C and</font>

361
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:33,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is linked to go back to the</font>

362
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:37,210
customer in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the yellow network that is</font>

363
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:40,630
not a desired situation but it was

364
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:47,140
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed by leaking the more</font>

365
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:49,600
specific internet routes yeah so a

366
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,840
little checklist about what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

367
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,330
have in place if you try to do this is

368
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,770
have a low liars LSP lifetime in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

369
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,000
domain you want to integrate otherwise

370
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:01,450
you have to wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a really long time</font>

371
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,220
for the database to purge and also you

372
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,320
have you need to be in total control if

373
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,600
you want to do health education or if

374
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:10,179
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> education</font>

375
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:13,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">you cannot have some parts doing it and</font>

376
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:16,330
some parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing it and and that is</font>

377
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:17,299
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it except that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

378
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,059
have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

379
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:24,070
control of which Luke Baggins addresses

380
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:24,070
are used in which areas of the network

381
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:34,070
yeah so a little bit about the actual

382
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:37,668
networks that we get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 3292 is a</font>

383
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:40,189
flat layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 domain and before we</font>

384
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:43,789
started integrating we had about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1300</font>

385
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:47,419
LSPs and that includes the pseudo notes

386
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:51,769
and 3246 was also a flat layer to

387
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:55,039
network with about 600 LSPs and now we

388
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:58,100
are about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-thirds of the 3246 has</font>

389
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:02,929
have been integrated now and we have

390
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:04,998
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1600 LSPs now the two numbers</font>

391
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:07,309
does not add up that's because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

392
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:10,820
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of routers in the</font>

393
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:13,580
process as well currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't see</font>

394
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:19,249
any need to split the whole network<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

395
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:21,859
lay it to lay<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh oh the layer 1 or layer</font>

396
00:22:19,249 --> 00:22:24,499
two domains and we haven't had<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

397
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:28,178
issues after we have done integration

398
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:28,179
and it's been all the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> very smoothly</font>

399
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,259
so what type of gear have we been

400
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,820
working on and where do we know what to

401
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:39,499
do with ayahs ayahs we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

402
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:44,509
on 7270 376 hundred years<font color="#CCCCCC"> are sincere as</font>

403
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:48,559
ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we were running iOS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tall 12 3</font>

404
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:51,440
12 to SB 12 to us aria and so on so

405
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:54,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">forth and we also had some junipers in</font>

406
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">there in the network mtrs and 160 s and</font>

407
00:22:54,529 --> 00:23:04,340
M 3 20's oh yeah for the configuration

408
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:07,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">exams I had we also have options he</font>

409
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,168
connections done on junipers so that in

410
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:11,210
case anybody want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know how to do it</font>

411
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:16,330
on junipers just send us<font color="#CCCCCC"> an email and</font>

412
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:16,330
and we can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

413
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:22,060
so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk a little bit more</font>

414
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:27,720
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> why do we like the options you</font>

415
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:31,210
connect option better than the option a

416
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:36,010
so option<font color="#CCCCCC"> a is very easy to interconnect</font>

417
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:38,110
to VPNs into different<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SS but you do</font>

418
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:40,629
need configuration for each customer's

419
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:42,909
on the link that I into connecting the

420
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:45,040
two networks if you want to add some

421
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:47,260
more capacity you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

422
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,320
customers configurations to<font color="#E5E5E5"> other more</font>

423
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:54,550
circuits or to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new circuit with more</font>

424
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:57,970
capacity on a qos mapping is not really

425
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:59,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that easy and also you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be sure</font>

426
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:04,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> routers that you do the</font>

427
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:07,659
interconnect on is a scalability because

428
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:11,050
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to carry all the other routes</font>

429
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:15,370
for every we r<font color="#CCCCCC"> s that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

430
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:18,010
interconnect if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use your option C</font>

431
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:20,199
which is more a connection between the

432
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:23,230
two networks more considered as a

433
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,650
backbone connection between<font color="#E5E5E5"> two parts of</font>

434
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:28,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network you do not need any customer</font>

435
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:30,070
configurations and that one you just

436
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:36,780
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as you would make any other</font>

437
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:39,850
backbone connection the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rio refs are</font>

438
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:42,520
configured on the peas but not again

439
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:45,040
only on the peas in both networks you

440
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,720
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were again to end and you</font>

441
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,300
would have services as Ethernet over

442
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,340
mpls via pls and all that kind of stuff

443
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:56,350
would work over that connection as well

444
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:58,330
and well for where I work you're adding

445
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:02,919
capacity to the nap to the link would

446
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:06,820
also be quite an easy task compared to

447
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:13,080
the other one so we try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it</font>

448
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:15,520
drawing on how do we how do we set up

449
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,909
the customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we make sure</font>

450
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:22,740
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> customers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vrs are connected and</font>

451
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:25,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">that'll work so we have the two networks</font>

452
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:28,000
3292 is the blue one and thirty to forty

453
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,970
six is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> green and we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enough CC</font>

454
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">connections between two</font>

455
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:41,760
a s border routers and then we have an

456
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:47,250
EVP session between the VPN rug reflexes

457
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so we have customer who is this is a</font>

458
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:51,510
new customer so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are setting him up</font>

459
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:55,230
from scratch<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you will work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

460
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:57,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">both networks right away so we just make</font>

461
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:59,430
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RT rd</font>

462
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:04,830
configuration in the two networks and

463
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:08,160
then when the routes are stains on the

464
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:10,590
beach p session then there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> imported</font>

465
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:16,380
into the vrf right away so it's simple

466
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:20,040
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the next slide we have a</font>

467
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:23,490
situation where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a vrf in one</font>

468
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:27,800
network with one RT rd and we have a

469
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:33,960
existing we are as in the green network

470
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:36,750
so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we connect those two using the</font>

471
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,830
option<font color="#E5E5E5"> c connections what would you is</font>

472
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:45,030
that we pick one network and in that one

473
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:47,220
configuration we just add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> target that</font>

474
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:51,830
matches the route occurred in the third

475
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:54,590
292 network now we have the right right

476
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:57,840
route target and we make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

477
00:26:54,590 --> 00:27:06,060
the routes are imported into the vrf

478
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:11,220
under 30 to 90 to be so<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep so where are</font>

479
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:14,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">we now we have we have split out two</font>

480
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:18,480
domains of thirty to forty six and

481
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:20,990
integrated those and that went very

482
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,430
smoothly and we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> no major issues and</font>

483
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,320
the last part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the network is supposed</font>

484
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:30,000
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> integrated within the next couple</font>

485
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:33,360
of weeks according to the plan so we

486
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,940
have people quite busy right now doing

487
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:42,030
the preparations for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and questions</font>

488
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,820
and comments if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody later</font>

489
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,908
please

490
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:55,990
feel free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to email us but also please</font>

491
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:58,480
come and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll ask now hi Nina a guy</font>

492
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:00,250
from limelight house just wondering if

493
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,509
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over some of the ISIS</font>

494
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,549
authentication issues you mentioned

495
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:05,889
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't i don't really</font>

496
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:13,809
understand where that would come into

497
00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:16,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">play really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we had we</font>

498
00:28:13,809 --> 00:28:18,970
have some is a network gear in the

499
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,710
network we we tried to we were

500
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,990
integrating<font color="#CCCCCC"> that didn't support of</font>

501
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:25,750
communication and actually you need all

502
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:27,340
LSPs to be authenticated so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i like you</font>

503
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,080
disable authentication or your

504
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,449
authenticator<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recipes</font>

505
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:34,600
because else women exchanged them

506
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:36,149
between browsers they would not get get

507
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,209
acknowledged and you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> simply just</font>

508
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:42,399
traffic being on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lengths of speed</font>

509
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the time so what we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

510
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:47,199
other person occasion is to configure

511
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:50,409
authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> indians integrated on the</font>

512
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,019
network which shines bright but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

513
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:55,809
configure sender only on cisco and the

514
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:57,970
equivalent on on juniper so the usps are

515
00:28:55,809 --> 00:29:00,759
indicated by the authentication in the

516
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,799
networking integrated isn't used so to

517
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:05,230
speak some and when the usps are being

518
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:08,080
flooded into the 3292 network

519
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:09,610
authentication is now and our

520
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,259
possibility of course is to get rid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

521
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:15,459
the hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i cannot do on occasion</font>

522
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:18,309
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ice is and ought not to run our eyes</font>

523
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:22,690
on those glasses and it has also also

524
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:25,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">been done so so take care of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DI size</font>

525
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:28,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and also be very rare sure about</font>

526
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:30,340
which loot bags have been being

527
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:33,009
redistributed between the network so we

528
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:36,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">aren't creating any loops things can go</font>

529
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:37,750
horribly wrong if if you aren't

530
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:40,600
absolutely sure about what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

531
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:42,519
but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are that and as Nina has as</font>

532
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,860
millions here actually it's quite easy

533
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:47,169
somewhat somewhat to do an empty less

534
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:52,678
gives you a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tools to route</font>

535
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:52,679
traffic the way you want so to speak
