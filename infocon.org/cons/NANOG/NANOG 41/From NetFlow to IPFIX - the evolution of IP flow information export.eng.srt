00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:06,450
good morning hi as he<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I'm Brian</font>

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,790
Trammell from the cert Network situation

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,200
awareness group in Pittsburgh presenting

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,389
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow to IP fix which is a</font>

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,100
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> on behalf of myself and the</font>

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:18,960
Lisa<font color="#CCCCCC"> bosque from hitachi europe so the</font>

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,660
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be answering in some</font>

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,430
detail this morning is what is IP fix

9
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,259
it's the emerging ITF standard for

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,050
exporting flow data from routers or

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,250
other metering processes so you know if

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,410
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like white box collectors or</font>

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,530
stuff set<font color="#E5E5E5"> up exporting flow information</font>

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,648
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network what it does define is a</font>

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,180
rich easily extensible information model

16
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:43,469
so it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it's all about</font>

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,460
extensibility it's all about not

18
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:51,480
defining a single data model for flow

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,510
export in a single a single method for

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,069
flow export but a way to define these

21
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,739
using a template driven data

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,500
representation and it's a unidirectional

23
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,239
push based protocol for exporting this

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,220
flow information over a variety of

25
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,048
transport protocols who pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,429
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knows what what floated is</font>

27
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:13,680
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that flow and stuff like that yeah</font>

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:15,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay good so what it doesn't define and</font>

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,939
this makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> different from a lot of</font>

30
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other the other flow export</font>

31
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,508
protocols and methods out there are

32
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,789
specific requirements for flow assembly

33
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:25,710
it's not an implementation of a flow

34
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,689
assembler it doesn't define floki

35
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,119
selection it it is a general

36
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,250
representation and protocol for moving

37
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,299
this data around so keep that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind we</font>

38
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about the implementations a</font>

39
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,170
little bit that it is the

40
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,210
implementations can each have their own

41
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,520
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sets of requirements and they</font>

42
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,089
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use IP fix to meet those</font>

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,189
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> in flexible ways so history</font>

44
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,799
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this for a while the</font>

45
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,839
working group started in 2001 to define

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,060
of a standard flow export protocol I

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,210
looked at a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the various work that</font>

48
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,030
was out there issued requirements and

49
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,939
then selected Cisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow version 9 as</font>

50
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,250
a basis for the new protocol so v9 is

51
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,199
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> just an evolution of Cisco</font>

52
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">netflow the biggest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change is the</font>

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition to templates for flexible data</font>

54
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,170
definition so instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like with kino</font>

55
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,980
say v5 and b7 where the data

56
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,390
representation is

57
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,340
defined as part of the protocol here is

58
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:21,268
your record format this allows in band a

59
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:25,019
definition of the data so it's like okay

60
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:26,790
here's here's a description of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow</font>

61
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:30,209
records i'm going to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> you here are a</font>

62
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,590
bunch of flow records sylvania that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

63
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:35,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocol was developed from the basis to</font>

64
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,080
meet those requirements um there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

65
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,890
some questions I hear a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

66
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,209
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well what level of</font>

67
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,179
compatibility is there between I pfx and

68
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:48,900
benign because one was was you know

69
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:51,269
directly evolved from the other the

70
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,239
information models the sets of data

71
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:55,950
elements you can export are kept

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,319
synchronous so that the IP fix

73
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,000
information model is a superset of the

74
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,108
v9 information model like all of the all

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,900
the little information all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the numbers</font>

76
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:06,840
are the same but<font color="#CCCCCC"> otherwise you can't</font>

77
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,430
just send v9 you can't export v9 flow

78
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,410
data to an IP fix collector and expect

79
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,650
it to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to do some message</font>

80
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:16,859
translation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so how does this work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

81
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,200
say in band in band definition of data

82
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:21,120
so an IP pic stream is splendid a

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,280
messages those messages can contain

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,370
essentially template sets or data sets

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data sets refer back to the</font>

86
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,030
template<font color="#CCCCCC"> sets so a template set will say</font>

87
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay the record type of this type has</font>

88
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,760
this information element followed by

89
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,680
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> information all all be this</font>

90
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,720
information element so on and then the

91
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,079
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> set will say here are a bunch of</font>

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">records of type and then a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number that</font>

93
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:44,190
refers back to that template so the

94
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:45,690
templates essentially are in band so

95
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,609
it's there's no there's no out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of main</font>

96
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,410
configuration of the of the data models

97
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:53,970
are the yeah the information model

98
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:55,410
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> its being exported which allows</font>

99
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:00,030
quite a lot more flexibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

100
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:01,950
respect to to what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can export so I</font>

101
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,329
say information what do I mean when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

102
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,129
the information model the information

103
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,440
model is a set of information elements a

104
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,989
set of feels that you can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in these</font>

105
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,639
flow records so most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> usual</font>

106
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,609
suspects are here you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> your five</font>

107
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,500
tuple for both v4 and v6 the<font color="#CCCCCC"> various</font>

108
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:19,918
standard counters basically total and

109
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,988
<font color="#E5E5E5">delta octet packet counters all of the</font>

110
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,789
various packet treatment stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

111
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:25,380
you're familiar with from<font color="#E5E5E5"> save be five</font>

112
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:27,570
or or s flow

113
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,090
various detail counters you can do sum

114
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:34,050
of squares there you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> count the</font>

115
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:37,739
occurrences of flags in a stream like so

116
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:41,070
specific tcp flags pretty much any ICMP

117
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:44,250
tcp or UDP header field and then some

118
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:48,270
sub IP information for various layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

119
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:50,970
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs mpls though you put the MPLS</font>

120
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,880
label stack in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flower records</font>

121
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,620
as well the flow keys that is what

122
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,600
defines whether if something goes into

123
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,890
one flow or another is not limited<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

124
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,240
specific set of information elements

125
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,860
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of new to it allows you to</font>

126
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,070
do lots<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sort of aggregate stuff so</font>

127
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,050
you could say export in aggregate where

128
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,510
the flow key is only the source IP

129
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,510
address and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just counting you're</font>

130
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:18,480
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> counting packets and records or</font>

131
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:22,920
packets and all cats from that source IP

132
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,270
address so in other sort of flow export

133
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,910
you have to handle the aggregates

134
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,880
differently this can be done in band ni

135
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:34,200
p fix so the information model itself is

136
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:36,540
extensible<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna registry you</font>

137
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,780
essentially good I n of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF and have</font>

138
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,630
new new information elements for public

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:45,090
use there's also a mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> for private</font>

140
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,880
extensions these are useful I've using

<font color="#CCCCCC">you'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the export from your your</font>

156
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,420
intended for many the same applications

157
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,370
is net flow in IP fix but it's a packet

158
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,450
sampling protocol so there are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

159
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,590
big advantages to this on the router

160
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:38,139
reduces your state overhead on the

161
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:41,590
measurement device there is a

162
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:44,889
a mechanism sort of in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP fix family</font>

163
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:46,270
of protocols called<font color="#CCCCCC"> peace amp that does</font>

164
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:48,879
pretty much the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing it allows you</font>

165
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:51,188
to use selected packet sampling and then

166
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:54,249
it uses the IP fix sort of the protocol

167
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:57,939
itself with defining<font color="#CCCCCC"> new flow keys to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so where are we it has taken a bit</font>

180
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,279
longer than we thought a lot of

181
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,870
standards efforts do the core protocol

182
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:34,029
documents were<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially completed</font>

183
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,270
last year they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably be published</font>

184
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:40,029
as RFC s this year the working group at

185
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,948
the IETF is continuing we're defining

186
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:43,509
extensions to<font color="#CCCCCC"> an applications of the</font>

187
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:46,689
protocol so for the most part the early

188
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:48,699
work was focused on getting the protocol

189
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:50,589
right now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on well how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

190
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:53,860
you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it especially especially sort of</font>

191
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:56,740
on the collector in and implementations

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,419
tracking the the draft standard are

193
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,149
available now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll talk about those</font>

194
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:02,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit later so I'm going to go</font>

195
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:05,469
over three of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most done</font>

196
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:07,330
extensions at this point one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

a few use cases data reduction you don't

00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:21,159
have to react sport your keys you can

<font color="#E5E5E5">separate answer traffic from an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer</font>

204
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:24,729
very quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> just by looking at the</font>

205
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:27,460
template ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's on the record</font>

206
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:30,460
and it works for<font color="#E5E5E5"> full reconstruction of</font>

207
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,968
TCP sessions now this wasn't in the

208
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:35,380
protocol to start there there was no

209
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:36,880
direct support for single record

210
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">exported bi-directional flow as if you</font>

211
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,219
had bi-directional flow information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

212
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:43,838
your collector you have to export to<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

213
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:48,370
records in a row 14 one direction one

214
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,199
for the other um this is largely because

215
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,519
the the working group was concerned with

216
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:51,829
export from routers and when you're

217
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,730
doing

218
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:55,998
asymmetric routing when you when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

219
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,139
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll see epacket</font>

220
00:08:55,999 --> 00:09:01,800
putting direct support in for<font color="#CCCCCC"> x</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flows</font>

221
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:05,279
may not make much sense but we're moving

222
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">into also essentially collectors or</font>

223
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,569
meters that are lower in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network so</font>

224
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:13,290
maybe at the subnet of the multi subnet

225
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:15,240
level and when you can see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

226
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,319
packets in both directions at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meter</font>

227
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,110
it makes a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

228
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:23,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">matching earlier rather than later hence</font>

229
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:25,290
this hence this extension basically the

230
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:26,939
way it works is it allows you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

231
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,910
any information element the information

232
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:32,490
model and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well this may be sort</font>

233
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,689
of your forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> counter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bobcats in this</font>

234
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,990
flow and here's the reverse kind of lock

235
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:39,509
that's in the flow so you basically to

236
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:42,420
represent a by flow you just take you

237
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:46,019
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> your flow key and then you have to</font>

238
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:49,079
information elements for for each record

239
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:52,550
one for each direction and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that should</font>

240
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:55,410
be published<font color="#E5E5E5"> in RFC this year another</font>

241
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,628
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this also works for data</font>

242
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,399
reduction called reducing redundancy is

243
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,839
essentially a mechanism for sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

244
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:05,189
foreign key references and IP fix you

245
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:08,220
can say here are here's like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of</font>

246
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:11,699
properties like say a source and

247
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,860
destination ipv6 address which in each

248
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:17,309
flow record would take up 32 bytes and

249
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:20,519
you can assign it a 32-bit number you

250
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:23,069
export the the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of at that ipv6</font>

251
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:26,220
address pair and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime that pair</font>

252
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:28,589
appears in the stream which in the

253
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,300
record stream you just give it this this

254
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:32,269
common properties ID that refers back to

255
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,599
it it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a general-purpose</font>

256
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:39,059
mechanism for doing that sort of thing

257
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,529
and it's focused largely on on bandwidth

258
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:41,550
saving information export especially

259
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:43,160
useful when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with large</font>

260
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:47,399
information elements like ipv6 addresses

261
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:50,819
um that'll also<font color="#CCCCCC"> do polishes in RFC this</font>

262
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:54,689
year so one thing we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at right</font>

263
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:57,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">now in the working group is that the</font>

264
00:10:54,689 --> 00:11:00,029
world large mini<font color="#E5E5E5"> workflows out there in</font>

265
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,769
the world are still very file-based like

266
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,950
you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this gigantic database that</font>

267
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:06,960
has a lot of your your network measuring

268
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:10,380
data in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but when you're doing a</font>

269
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,680
specific a specific study or handling a

270
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,790
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> incident on the security side</font>

271
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,550
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take some subset of this flow</font>

272
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,780
data put it into a file files are I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

273
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,550
we're really good at working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> files</font>

274
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,870
you can you can make them available<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

275
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,099
download you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can email</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them to people</font>

276
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,850
you can put names on them you can

277
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:30,540
encrypt them you can compress them um

278
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:33,350
and it sort of in dealing with with flow

279
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,189
storage there's already an existing

280
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,170
standard for dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with and that is</font>

281
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,940
anyone who's using fov<font color="#CCCCCC"> five just takes</font>

282
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:42,660
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NetFlow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> b5 pd-user allows them to</font>

283
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,980
disk and boom you have a file um so the

284
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,770
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is not extensible for</font>

285
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,330
data fields that aren't in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that flow v5</font>

286
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:51,750
so we're proposing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> essentially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

287
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:56,160
the IP fix message format is a basis for

288
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:58,230
a file format um has several advantages

289
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:03,660
that you get the extensibility to

290
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:05,910
self-description um it's in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of in</font>

291
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,260
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of use cases it makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font>

292
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,339
than say taking on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your photo certainly</font>

293
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,200
makes more sense taking all your foot in

294
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,460
is taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an XML</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you get the</font>

295
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,440
same sort of self description that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

296
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:17,970
get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML document but since flow data</font>

297
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:20,240
is not nearly as semantically varied you

298
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:23,570
don't want to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> the overhead of XML</font>

299
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,130
this of course also makes sense to in a

300
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:28,410
IP fix collection infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

301
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:30,150
essentially I mean we're proposing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

302
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,610
essentially the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you do</font>

303
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,680
with v5 pdu files so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can make a very</font>

304
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">very simple exporting process just by</font>

305
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,250
taking one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your files and net catting</font>

306
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,510
and out of Port and you can do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

307
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:43,740
thing with netcat to make a collecting

308
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:45,210
process to pull in so yeah basically an

309
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,510
IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed file is just any serialized</font>

310
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:50,400
stream of messages you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can think of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

311
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:53,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a file transport for IP fixed IP fix</font>

312
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,980
runs over<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP runs over UDP runs over</font>

313
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">sctp and this is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fourth a fourth</font>

314
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,300
sort of transport layer for that there's

315
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,370
a set of extensions in the draft for

316
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,510
noting the contents of a file so if you

317
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,920
have a lot of files you can serve see

318
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,920
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> very quickly without having to to</font>

319
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,469
sequentially scan them various error

320
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,189
detection and recovery schemes

321
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,720
especially if you're taking large

322
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,280
amounts of flow data storing it on a

323
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,209
disk for a long period of time you want

324
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know if if something's happened to it</font>

325
00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:21,498
and then some extended type of

326
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,839
information for these<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enterprise</font>

327
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:25,970
specific information elements so if you

328
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,850
have a if you've defined your own

329
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:31,999
information almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pilot use in the</font>

330
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:35,899
protocol right now there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really a</font>

331
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:37,309
method for for saying anything about the

332
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,290
type information you can just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

333
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:42,079
here's here's a chunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of octet over here</font>

334
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,980
represents some some informational and

335
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,059
I'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you anything more</font>

336
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it you can't do anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font>

337
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:48,740
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this doesn't work as well for a</font>

338
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,599
couple of situations one of those is you

339
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,860
define an information element you store

340
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,029
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data you come back to a two</font>

341
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,420
years later you have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea what it is</font>

342
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:57,769
so this actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't it's in a</font>

343
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:00,050
separate drop now this has been split

344
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:04,550
out and we're thinking both of easily

345
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:07,008
publishes RF season next year so status

346
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:09,050
of implementations there are are quite a

347
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:10,639
few open source implementations out

348
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:14,779
there available you can go play with

349
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:18,319
them today if you like one is done by

350
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:20,179

354
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:31,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">this version repository about two years</font>

355
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:33,949
ago and it's stuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so it takes</font>

356
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,329
packets from the wire or<font color="#CCCCCC"> latika dump</font>

357
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:37,969
files turns them into IP fix file 2

358
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:39,378
r.i.p fix messages and does support

359
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,179
bi-directional flow export so this is

360
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:44,209
sort of an area that that has been

361
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:47,899
tracking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the draft standard as as it's</font>

362
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:49,790
been evolving and this feeds into the

363
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:52,809
silk system for internet level knowledge

364
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:56,149
which was originally a large v5

365
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:59,719
collection and storage and analysis tool

366
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:02,089
set pretty specifically focused on on

367
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,949
using NetFlow data for security analysis

368
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:07,879
tasks but can also use for traffic

369
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:09,439
engineering it supports v5<font color="#CCCCCC"> in IP fix</font>

370
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,149
flow collection and can also you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

371
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:12,709
the analysis tools to directly analyze

372
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:15,860
IP pics files by translating them into

373
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:17,420
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the self native format first all</font>

374
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,879

375
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,649
website and then there's a a library

376
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:24,740
underneath this that's used by<font color="#E5E5E5"> both the</font>

432
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:10,539
IETF in many instances of protocol

00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,279
development out it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seem</font>

434
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:14,679
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should take six seven years to</font>

435
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:17,139
build a spec 44 something like net flow

436
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:19,690
in a 65 pages that's pretty long that's

437
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:23,110
almost as big as a TCP spec what is it

438
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that where is this we're just going Ron</font>

439
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,969
there's 26 revisions I mean what can we

440
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:33,510
do to improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the ITF failing us</font>

441
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:36,039
so dramatically now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

442
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:39,399
bigger question but we have time so i'll

443
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:40,809
address it first of all I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> deserve</font>

444
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:41,918
any particular kudos everyone let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

445
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:45,070
doing this for the last year and a half

446
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,750
so in sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new blood um no it's been</font>

447
00:18:45,070 --> 00:19:01,418
two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay maybe a little bit anyway</font>

448
00:18:46,750 --> 00:19:05,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">um yes that is absolutely um one of the</font>

449
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:07,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">issues I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you run into is uh</font>

450
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,850
there's a lot of squabbling in in

451
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:11,710
protocol design especially when you have

452
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:15,129
one community of people who are

453
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:17,350
primarily focused on the export side on

454
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,820
the generating<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you know writing the</font>

455
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,559
protocol and another group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people who</font>

456
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,230
are focused on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the import side so there</font>

457
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,539
was a lot of going around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and around and</font>

458
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,500
around about that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

459
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:29,530
just saying okay yeah

460
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,670
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it and I mean I have I</font>

461
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,320
have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mixed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feelings about this</font>

462
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you want to get it right right</font>

463
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,960
of course you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get it right</font>

464
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:41,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">in 2014 when no one cares anymore um so</font>

465
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,270
it is a balance to strike some working

466
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:46,330
groups do it better than others some

467
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:48,370
don't do it at all as far as like what

468
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,830
policies i personally would implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

469
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,239
I'm not certain that's a that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer</font>

470
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:59,490
discussion and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can certainly take it</font>

471
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:59,490
offline but anyone else

472
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,419
all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>
