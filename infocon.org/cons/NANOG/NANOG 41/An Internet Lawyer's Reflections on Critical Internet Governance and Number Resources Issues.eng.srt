to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an internet lawyer I decided at</font>

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,879
that point that it was better to be a

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,230
broken-down internet lawyer than it was

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,260
to be a broken-down white-collar

20
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,250
criminal defense lawyer and I made my

switch to this technology so this will

22

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,310
politely and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want everybody</font>

who challenges me to say who they are

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:28,110
and whether they're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> legacy address</font>

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,000
partial sense of humor and to bring you

34
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,460
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the usual stupid jokes that</font>

35

you tell like you know what's 150

36
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,559
lawyers at the bottom of the ocean a

37
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,070
good start these are the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more</font>

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,829
elegant jokes about lawyers and my

39
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,658
favorite really is the first one you

40
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,270
know we lawyers can fight with one

41
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,119
another very politely and so one night

42
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,189
Daniel Webster was debating<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the soul</font>

43
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,610
of a new hampshire<font color="#E5E5E5"> minh against the</font>

44
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,619
devil and at one point as lawyers do the

45
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,530
two went to the bar together the devil

46
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,510
and daniel webster and do

47
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">Webster really marveled at the devil's</font>

48
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,880
knowledge of the law and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said sir</font>

49
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,589
where did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you come by that and the devil</font>

50
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,859
answered well where I come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

51
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:28,950
always get the pic of the bar my other

52
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,130
favorite is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Governor William Langer who</font>

53
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:35,250
is a governor in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 1930s in one of the</font>

54
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,780
plains states and his quote was if you

55
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">put a banker or a lawyer and an</font>

56
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,680
industrialist and a barrel and roll it

57
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,000
down the hill you've always got a son<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

58
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,760
a bitch on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top so there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,640
insult us that are better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the ones</font>

60
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,440
about no skid marks and why we use

61
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,149
lawyers because the people become

62
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,319
attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the rats you know that sort</font>

63
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:00,060
of thing and so finally I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do</font>

64
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,250
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit like a black church</font>

65
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,440
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to require some audience</font>

66
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,360
participation and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

67
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,930
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you to look up from your</font>

reading for this course while we're here

70
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:21,720
together is RFC 2050 and RFC 2008 you

71
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,709
who are looking down which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of</font>

72
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are going to be reading 2050 and</font>

73
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:33,360
2008 while well I'm up here all right

74
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:36,110
off we go let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

75
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,079
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very interesting experiment</font>

76
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:43,320
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world there are governments</font>

77
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:47,040
that don't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this room is a</font>

78
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,750
meaningful room this<font color="#CCCCCC"> room contains the</font>

79
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,230
people who actually make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

80
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,540
run and in a lot of countries there are

81
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:58,260
government's that would like the

82
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,570
controls that are currently distributed

83
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,828
in part to non-governmental

84
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,060
organizations to be taken back into

85
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:08,400
governmental control both on a national

86
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,500
and international basis so right now

87
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,980
there's an interesting experiment and

<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Governance that's going on none</font>

94
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:32,430
the internet and it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> clash of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet be governed and it was one</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">nongovernmental</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations in some</font>

100

<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't the critical part of the world</font>

102
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,780
governmental role is a legitimate one

103
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:54,150
for example no one in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> room I think</font>

104
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">would dispute that governments have a</font>

role fighting child pornography to take

social purpose or perhaps some of you

109
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,909
are libertarian enough that you believe

110
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,069
child pornography is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I personally</font>

111
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:12,659
don't believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is and I believe</font>

112
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:15,840
the government has a legitimate role

there but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean that we</font>

114

don't have a legitimate role so as we

dealing with their brothers and sisters

00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:49,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">9 of the legacy RSA is really stealing</font>

147

something that belongs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody I</font>

00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,270
everything else is going to fit into

151
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:06,000
let's talk a little bit about what's

152
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:09,210
going going on in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world while we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

153
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,870
be very comfortable in North America

154
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:15,090
with distributed power in other words in

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:17,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the United States and in Canada and</font>

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,260
and other governments in this region

157
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,690
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very comfortable with the</font>

158
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,670
distributed power particularly in the

159
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,160
United States which I'm most familiar

160
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:28,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the legal system we believe in a</font>

161
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,530
limited government and we believe in the

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">right of the people to do certain things</font>

163
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:37,109
well that's not true around the world

164
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:39,960
and so for example tiny Estonia which is

165
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:44,220
a country<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was in the soviet orbit</font>

166
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,140
for almost 50 years when<font color="#E5E5E5"> estonia and</font>

168
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,450
countries of Eastern Europe resumed

169
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:54,510
their rightful role in Europe as a

170
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:56,729
European country there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are people who</font>

171
00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:01,190
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that in the world and we all</font>

172
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:04,380
read earlier this year about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Estonia's</font>

173
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:07,080
intention to be an e-government and to

174
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,100
be an e society and how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came under</font>

175
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:12,990
attack from forces in another country

176
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,270
but perhaps sponsored by a government

177
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,480
and perhaps not certainly our

178
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,400
intelligence<font color="#CCCCCC"> services know more about</font>

179
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,190
that than we do but one could presume

180
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,250
that that sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an attack is a very</font>

181
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:30,290
important issue we recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> watched as</font>

182
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:34,110
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> burmese internet was shut off to</font>

183
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:36,240
stem the flow of seeing what was

184
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:40,890
actually happening in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that country</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

185
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,500
so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are real stakes in terms of who</font>

186
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:46,230
gets to govern the internet and so let

187
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,500
me just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say as a North American we</font>

188
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:52,440
cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell Burma Cuba China or any</font>

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,160
other country about how they should

190
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,199
permit

191
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,350
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the internet within their</font>

192

country that is their sovereign right we

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,620
may disagree with them about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

194
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,470
internal rights for their<font color="#CCCCCC"> citizens but</font>

195
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,509
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is their right to do that but it is</font>

196
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:10,500
also are right i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think to defend our</font>

rights so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've gone at a top</font>

198
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,379
level political superstructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font>

199
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:18,829
now come back down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to issues that are</font>

200
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:23,759
more familiar to people in this room

201
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:26,550
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a coming crisis with</font>

202
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:30,449
regard to internet protocol numbering

203
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:33,569
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SNS as you all know we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

204
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:35,878
working under ipv4 the numbers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

205
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:38,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">showing there are a chart that was</font>

206
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,139
developed a few months ago i'm sure it's

207
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,259
changed since then that shows the

208
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:47,279
devolution of /<font color="#CCCCCC"> aids in the iono pool</font>

209
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:50,639
and as you can see there's an a finite

210
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:54,930
number of remaining unallocated ipv4

211
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:58,350
blocks that number it will decline<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:00,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero at some point the question is when</font>

213
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,480
that declined to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 will occur but</font>

214
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:07,410
clearly there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> declined</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zero coming</font>

215
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:11,370

in 2010 it may come in 2011 but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

217
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:17,370
clearly coming may come next year

218
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:20,579
depending on the global needs as people

219
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:24,089
wake up to this issue so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a</font>

220
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:27,599
situation where we have a good that we

221
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:29,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently allocate based on principles</font>

222
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,670
that have been well understood<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

223
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:35,490
agreed<font color="#E5E5E5"> with in the internet community</font>

224
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:39,439
where we're going to run out and there's

225
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have to be a substitution so</font>

226
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:45,449
how serious is this problem from my

227
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,309
standpoint as a lawyer not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an</font>

228
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:51,329
engineer I think it's a very serious

229
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:54,120
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I tied it back to my previous</font>

230
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:56,279
political slides if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

234
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:11,040
apart handle this transition bad

235
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:13,350
Lee if the US economy or other worldwide

236
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,170
economies cannot grow appropriately

237
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,090
because we miss handle this transition I

238
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,010
think there could be significant

239
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,170
political consequences in other words I

240
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,810
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> revving you up on the political</font>

241
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,640
part without tying it back to what I

242
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:31,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">think is coming in this particular area</font>

243
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,960
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't as the people who think</font>

244
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,870
we understand how to do this that is you

245
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,360
not me run the internet properly if we

246
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:43,130
don't do this transition properly we

247
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,230
could lose the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current governance model</font>

248
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:49,140
so what does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron board had to say</font>

249
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:52,230
about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron is the registry as you</font>

250
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:55,050
know for North America other than Mexico

251
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:58,140
and some of the islands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Caribbean</font>

252
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:01,260
the service region that we have there

253
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:05,069
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> five rirs as you know all of them</font>

254
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:08,370
regionally based broadly based<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron is</font>

00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:11,490
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very proud to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have assisted the</font>

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:20,160
sister organizations but for Aaron

259
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,990
itself erin was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first rir I believe</font>

260
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,270
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I may be wrong about this but I</font>

261
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:27,150
believe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were the first to basically</font>

262
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:29,910
adopt a position that said we can't be

263
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:33,900
neutral anymore given the depletion of

264
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:37,980
the ipv4 space there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a need now to</font>

265
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:41,850
adopt ipv6 with all of its warts and

266
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:44,730
ugliness and unintended consequences and

267
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:47,580
costs and all of that there is a

268
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:52,050
necessity according to the Aaron board

269
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:55,160
to move to ipv6 and for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

270
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:57,630
room to help their organizations do that

271
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,449
clearly the United<font color="#E5E5E5"> States government for</font>

272
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:03,360
example is requiring its own agencies to

273
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:06,780
have ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> plans and I assume every</font>

274
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,900
sovereign nation is making its own plans

275
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:14,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure that its economy</font>

276
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:16,319
transitions to ipv6 now that said what

277
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,900
I'm about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the rest of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this talk represents my views of certain</font>

279
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:24,100
policy issues they don't necessarily

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:26,079
early represent the air in position<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

281
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,060
try and be clear when I'm speaking for

<font color="#CCCCCC">haren rather than speaking for myself</font>

283
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:33,638
but there's a modest freedom that comes

284
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:35,260
for speaking for oneself as I assess

285
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:40,570
some of the policy issues that we have

<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at okay so some policy proposals</font>

that are coming up now in the in the

288
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:49,990
world to address the ipv4 depletion

289
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:52,810
issue call for a fundamental change in

290
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,639
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> current system which leads the</font>

291
00:13:52,810 --> 00:14:01,420
question well what is our current system

292
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:03,910
in RFC 2008 believe 1996 essentially the

293
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:08,709
community developed a policy that said

294
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:12,279
IP addresses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> asns IP resources if</font>

295
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:16,359
you will are not owned<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they're not</font>

296
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:20,829
owned their loaned so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example when</font>

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:23,800
the iono transfers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron Aaron</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

298
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:28,089
not own the IP numbers and when Aaron

299
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:30,729
issues an IP number to someone for their

300
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:33,220
use it is not an ownership issue that's

301
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:37,209
being transferred it is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right to use</font>

302
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:39,490
the services that's what RFC 2008 said

303
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:41,199
you can look it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read it this</font>

304
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,290
morning again to make sure that I was

305
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,899
okay on this and I think fundamentally I

306
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:50,050
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring you back as a lawyer would</font>

307
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:52,269
lawyers look at precedent the precedent

308
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:57,099
for this community<font color="#CCCCCC"> is its adoption of</font>

309
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:59,350
RFC 2008 and RFC 2050 so let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask the</font>

310
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,230
first question and now i want some

311
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:06,639
audience participation how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:10,089

313
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,130
the key author of RFC 2050 did is there

anybody out there who agrees with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

317
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,769
I see others okay Paul<font color="#CCCCCC"> vixy is the only</font>

one who's either awake or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font>

319
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:32,199
David actually the key author was Kim

Hubbard<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay was kif I'm sorry well Kim</font>

I indeed has got her name at the bottom

of it

or my gentleman from iono would you

disagree with me that John was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

330
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,709
asked you David on such John Oh John was

331
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:03,869
a contributor<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kim was the primary author</font>

332
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:05,729
on them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good all right I'll accept</font>

333
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:09,300
that Randy did you want to change that

334
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:11,730
they're correct pardon me oh okay good

335
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,680
Randy agrees that something I've said is

336
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:18,899
correct once I agreed with<font color="#E5E5E5"> David condo</font>

337
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,370
okay no sir but I agree it would remind

338
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">you that I helped hire you oh well and</font>

339
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:31,110
mistakes are made every day so now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

340
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:34,890
on from there I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little</font>

341
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:37,230
bit about what the terms of 2050 say and

342
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:39,630
I decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add them to the slide so</font>

343
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,370
that while you're reading the USA<font color="#CCCCCC"> Today</font>

344
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:44,010
on the sports page about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rockies</font>

345
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:48,180
going to the World Series you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could look</font>

346
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:51,120
up and and see that RFC 2050

347
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:53,760
contemplates that david conrad not steve

348
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:58,260
ryan i repeat<font color="#E5E5E5"> david conrad not steve</font>

349
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:03,810
ryan has the right to claw back from

350
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:06,689
people ultimately unused unused IP

351
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:08,698
resources that have been issued where

352
00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:11,760
the chain where where there where the

353
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:14,790
use of them is invalidated and and so

354
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,640
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice to David I'm always</font>

355
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:20,449
nice to David there is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

356
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,069
provision there about unused resources

357
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:27,000
the second provision that I'd like you

358
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:31,800
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in mind is the right to transfer</font>

359
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:35,070
is limited by 2050 two transfers that

360
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:38,070
are in accord with the policies of the

361
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:40,860
registry I see someone standing at the

362
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:43,290
microphone so i will stop and yield<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

363
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,668
not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to yield all the time but if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

364
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,210
know the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I like them I'm</font>

365
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:48,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

366
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,799
go ahead thank you see if that means

367
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,408
that I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say for the record that</font>

I'm actually Suzanne<font color="#CCCCCC"> wolfen I'm speaking</font>

only for myself at the moment um a style

370
00:17:55,169 --> 00:18:00,929
point not to interrupt let's talk in

371
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:03,559
terms of institutions rather than

372
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:06,600
individuals when discussing our current

373
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:08,760
mechanisms in situation it's important

374
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world the webcast audience</font>

certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first point</font>

380
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,960
about Aaron not<font color="#E5E5E5"> steve ryan on the second</font>

381
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,120
point you know I I do believe that

382
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,279
governments like when we have a

383
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,168
president we only have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a time he</font>

384
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,669
can be a good president or he can be a

385
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:40,649
bad president but he's still the

386
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:42,539
president and of course david has that

387
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:44,789
current authority but I take your point

388
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:46,890
yeah i just wanted that noted for the

389
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:49,500
other has depersonalization is an

390
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:52,590
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue you were saying what 20</font>

you referenced in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it section 3 is</font>

actually not in reference to allocations

iono as an entity I Anna does not

405
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:53,940

operate<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the request of others all</font>

00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:59,010
right we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back to this point on</font>

00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:02,040
the transfer<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

409
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:05,220
the transfers have to be done consistent

410
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:11,100
with our IR policy and that's what's in

411
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:13,410
2050 third<font color="#E5E5E5"> fee-for-service one of the</font>

412
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:17,159
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the RIR community</font>

413
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:18,810
has done is these<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fees and and I</font>

414
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,970
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this goes to something we're going</font>

415
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:25,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be talking about in a moment the fees</font>

416
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:26,880
for the allocation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of IP resources for</font>

417
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,330
the services related to that have

418
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,240
remained<font color="#CCCCCC"> relatively low and as we push</font>

419
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:36,659
forward you'll see that economists might

420
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,590
with a scarce good want the price to

421
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:42,690
rise and the quantity to be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> limited</font>

422
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:45,149
but at this point the fee for services

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,460
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are charged</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by the rirs however</font>

annoying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people are actually quite</font>

425
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:54,120
small and by order of magnitude could be

426
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:57,629
raised significantly without actually

427
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,520
affecting the the price to consumers in

428
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:02,370
other words as we look at the service

429

bundle that's delivered to consumers the

cost of obtaining IP resources from the

431
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:12,870
registries is an extraordinarily small

this goes to what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen in</font>

way similar but different that if you

440
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:42,449
receive a false set of documentation if

441
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:44,129

<font color="#CCCCCC">the policy proposals that are coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

the rirs are still conducting business

457
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,919
or the iono is conducting business well

458
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:36,200
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some policy proposals that say</font>

459
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:39,170
we won't work on utilization anymore

460
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:43,850
we'll work on the basis of equality of

461
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:47,780
regions so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example even if several</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">regions have a utilization need that is</font>

463
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,860
there are people who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting for</font>

464
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:54,290
addresses and need them for something

465
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:57,169
that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could prove we're still going</font>

466
00:22:54,290 --> 00:23:01,159
to allocate equally to regions around

467
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:04,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the globe because that's fair so there</font>

468
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:06,710
are issues like that that would change

469
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">the allocation method that's currently</font>

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:12,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">being followed which is basically</font>

471
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:16,580
utilization as each region needs a new

472
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:22,970
block of IP addresses to distribute it

473
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:30,010
obtains that from the iono i think the

474
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:30,010
slide says the same thing as the ha so

475
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,620
let's talk about markets let's talk

476
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:40,669
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

477

<font color="#CCCCCC">should be a sale permitted in a way not</font>

478
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:46,130
of the fundamental right of ownership of

479
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,770
the IP although perhaps some people

480
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,320
believe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well but the the right</font>

00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:54,110
the bundle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rights to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP</font>

482
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,810
there's some proposals to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

483
00:23:54,110 --> 00:24:00,040
market for that and again anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's</font>

484
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:03,440
creating a market for sale on

485
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:05,120
redistribution of IP resources needs to

486
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,790
define whether they're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

487
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:11,590
there's an ownership of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that which would</font>

488
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:14,780
be contrary to 2008<font color="#E5E5E5"> and contrary to 2050</font>

489
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:17,990
versus a market which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not permitted</font>

490
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:20,870
right now by policy for the sale or

491
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:24,400
redistribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the limited right to</font>

492
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:26,418
use the IP Resources consistent with

493
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,509
2008<font color="#CCCCCC"> and 2050</font>

494
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:32,389
and again the creation of such a market

495
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:35,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">of either of those markets would be a</font>

496
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:38,959
fundamental<font color="#CCCCCC"> change in current policy</font>

497
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:41,570
proponents of a market have the duty I

498
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,929
think to come before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

499
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:48,918
community and convince you that because

500
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:52,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the current depletion of ipv4 the</font>

501
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:56,359
market is the best way to either cushion

502
00:24:52,580 --> 00:25:00,220
the transition to v6 to extend the life

503
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:04,309
of v4 if that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing on to</font>

504
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:08,720
reallocate underutilized or indeed not

505
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:12,289
utilized v4 resources to those who could

506
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,989
use them there are pros and cons of a

507
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:17,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">model I am NOT here to tell you today</font>

508
00:25:14,989 --> 00:25:20,179
that a model is evil and you should

509
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:22,669
avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in order to embrace it and say</font>

510
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:24,590
a model is a mark pardon me I didn't

511
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:27,200
mean to say model and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then say market</font>

512
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:28,879
that a market is a great thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

513
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,249
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> embrace it or that you should</font>

514
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:33,709
reject it what I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to do is share</font>

515
00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:36,230
with you some of the thinking from a

516
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,980
lawyer's perspective about what the

517
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:42,529
transition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a market would mean</font>

518
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:46,489
lawyers are very skeptical if you will

519
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:50,440
of changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the legal regime that we are</font>

520
00:25:46,489 --> 00:25:56,139
in currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> erin has 12</font>

522
00:25:56,139 --> 00:26:02,359
registration services agreements that

523
00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:05,509
permit entities that range in size<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Department of Defense or</font>

526
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:17,450
Microsoft down to the smallest<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP those</font>

527
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:20,570
11,500 contracts are all premise on the

528
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:25,190
right the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same rights that are described</font>

529
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:28,039
in RFC 2008<font color="#CCCCCC"> and 2050 that is that there</font>

530
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:29,869
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no ownership of that I p by the</font>

531
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:31,759
resulting entity in other words the

532
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:34,609
Department of Defense or Microsoft or

533
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:37,999
the small ISP has no ownership right in

534
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:39,500
those services but is obtaining services

535
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:41,240
that

536
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,160
will be given<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them for that period</font>

537
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,100
and when they no longer need those

538
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:49,430
services they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> return the IP</font>

539
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:52,159
resources to the community so if we

540
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:55,910
start by recognizing that the legal

541
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:58,520
regime that's been created mirrors the

542
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:04,160
policy regime that a room like this

543
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:07,639
created or that miss Hubbard and and jon

544
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:10,580
postel created with your consensus and

545
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,040
agreement if that is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case then the</font>

546
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:16,520
legal regime is consistent with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that now</font>

547
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:19,370
it's very very hard to say for example

548
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:23,150
we're going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a market that will</font>

549
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:26,449
begin on<font color="#E5E5E5"> X day and we will change in</font>

550
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:28,340
essence the rights that people have as a

551
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,610
matter of policy and permit them to

552
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:35,389
begin selling the right to use those

553
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:37,820
services to someone else when you don't

554
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:41,660
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the registry because all of</font>

00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:44,510
the current 11,500 contracts<font color="#E5E5E5"> are premise</font>

market help I think I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried to</font>

561
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:05,990
distill what are the best arguments for

562
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:08,000
and against the market and I have them

00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:13,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">with me I don't did put them on a slide</font>

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:17,000
bear with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me for a second okay let me</font>

565
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:19,190
give you the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> six policy arguments</font>

that I can come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with against a market</font>

567
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:26,360
and then I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give you the six</font>

568
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:34,000
six or seven best arguments for a market

569
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:37,790
in this area the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> argument I think</font>

570
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,070
against a market is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it will play</font>

571
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:43,940
havoc with the routing table in other

words as you sub<font color="#E5E5E5"> atomized blocks and</font>

573
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:52,980
reduce them there is a tension that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

574
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:55,620
described in 2050 and in 2008 between

the impact on the routing table and the

smaller size of blocks so clearly

577
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:03,990
there's a point at which<font color="#CCCCCC"> the market</font>

can't be permitted to drive the<font color="#E5E5E5"> size of</font>

592
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:51,030
that when you speak to<font color="#CCCCCC"> policymakers in</font>

593
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:53,549
any way you have to educate them the

industry the people in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> room have to</font>

00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:58,590
educate people in the top level of the

596
00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:01,290
corporate suite about the impact of this

597
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:04,080
on the routing table as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the</font>

598
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:07,220
second argument against markets is that

599
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,020
the market will actually delay

600
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:12,870
implementation of v6 in other words if

601
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to get to v6 there are some</font>

602
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:17,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you ought to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get there</font>

603
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:19,678
quicker that the transition needs to be

604
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:24,000
shorter to v6 and that anything that

605
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,590
extends the v4 marketplace might be a

606
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,059
bad thing and that can obviously be

its head in a minute the other part of

609
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:38,700
the third argument against a market is

610
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:41,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transition will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be harder if we</font>

611
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,860
permit the market to ameliorate the

00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision-making of people who want to</font>

stick with<font color="#CCCCCC"> vie for the fourth reason</font>

614
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,570
against the market is it will result in

615
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:54,780
a windfall that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is inappropriate to</font>

616
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:57,600
legacy address holders for example who

617
00:30:54,780 --> 00:31:01,649
may have unused space that they obtained

618
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:05,490
earlier and where the market for a short

619
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:06,480
period may reward people for those

620
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,919
holdings which they

621
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:13,080
haven't utilized a fifth reason for

622
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:16,620
being against the market is it could

623
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:20,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">result in inter continental or inter</font>

rich economies over poor economies in

microphone into a cogent argument that

637
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:57,710
appeared on the bottom of the slide

638
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:00,120
professor Edelman is a professor of

business at the Harvard<font color="#CCCCCC"> Business School</font>

he has a PhD in economics he has a

degree that is juris doctor he's a

lawyer as well from Harvard and he has

644
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:20,570
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> engaged by Aaron to provided advice</font>

about whether a market is inevitable<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4v4</font>

646
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:25,620
what are the characteristics of that

00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:28,168
market if it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> occur that are</font>

policy decisions and or how can the

very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas about it and I think</font>

655
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,860
professor Edelman would probably be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

656
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:55,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">to share with you at least on this point</font>

657
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:58,199
that markets favor rich economies over

658
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:00,689
poor economies that rich economies if

659
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,470
permitted the right Mike<font color="#CCCCCC"> cherry-pick</font>

660
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:05,820
ipv4 resources from the third world and

661
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:09,000
that that might not be a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

662
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:13,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">result</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and finally we all know that</font>

663
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,559
markets if not controlled<font color="#E5E5E5"> appropriately</font>

664
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:18,960
constrained by law regulation can lead

665
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,770
to hoarding speculation and price

666
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,020
manipulation

667
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:23,670
so we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are certain</font>

668
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:26,580
aspects of markets that can lead to

669
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:28,830
unattractive behavior now just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font>

670
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,419
you that I'm a lawyer and that I can do

671
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:32,790
on the one hand and on the other hand

672
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,860
now let me be<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and be equally</font>

673
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:38,340
convincing that there are seven reasons

674
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:40,229
one might want to market and again as

675
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,689
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell i'm not here to tell you</font>

676
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:44,790
what the right answer is of market or no

677
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:48,000
market but let me give you policy

678
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:51,600
reasons of for a market the policy

679
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,980
reasons are it ricura jizz reclamation

680
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:59,310
of underutilized or unused prior prior

681
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:03,060
allocations it will encourage ipv6

682
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:11,270
adoption by allowing a longer buffer

683
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:15,360
period for ipv6 adoption it will permit

684
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:17,520
transfers so that the market can dictate

685
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:21,720
what the highest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best use of an IP</font>

686
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:25,340
resources another benefit of the market

687
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:30,600
is that it the market will substitute

688
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:32,070
market power for stewardship in a

689
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,168
meaningful way in<font color="#E5E5E5"> other words</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

690
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,730
will vote with<font color="#E5E5E5"> their dollars and that</font>

691
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:43,350
that will result in meaningful

<font color="#CCCCCC">decision-making the market can deter bad</font>

693
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:48,600
behavior in other words somebody who

694
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:51,060
tries to corner the market may end up

695
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:54,630
like the Hunts because what we know is

696
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:56,250
that ipv4 may never be shut off but

697
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:58,950
there'll be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> period where ipv4</font>

698
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,660
resources are considered more valuable

699
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:03,660
and then there'll be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> period where</font>

700
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:07,259
their value declines and if someone

701
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:09,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">tries to corner that market they may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

702
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:12,870
up with a lot of ipv4 resources that

703
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:14,879
nobody wants at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day so if</font>

704
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:18,420
your forum market you may decide that

705
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,830
arbitrage<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good and if you're against</font>

00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">a market you could say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

707
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:24,690
speculation and price manipulation might

708

be bad so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some of the thoughts</font>

that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> rattling around on markets now</font>

710
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,530
this brings us to legacy address space

711
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,990
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me ask a question</font>

712
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,940
how many legacy address holders are out

713
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:42,479
there in the audience today if you could

714
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:47,470
choose to put up your hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we have</font>

715
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:52,570
15 to 18 maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 legacy address holders</font>

716
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:54,520
and I'm looking forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> to having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

717
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:57,730
discussion with all of you as the week

718
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,740
goes on about anything I say here what I

719
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:01,690
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ask is that when we talk to</font>

720
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,759
legacy address holders if you would

721
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:05,050
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the following conditions will</font>

722
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,510
you agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you come to the</font>

723
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:10,270
microphone you tell us how big an

724
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:13,960
allocation you got and how much of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

725
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:15,250
not currently being utilized that that

726
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,220
would be different than how much of as

727
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:22,450
announced we'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad to take all of</font>

728
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:26,850
your questions then after that just a

729
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:30,549
suggestion let me say that that there

730
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:33,370
before the registries existed before

731
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:36,130
Aaron existed before ap Nick group

732
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:38,980
existed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> before ripe existed the</font>

733
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:41,470
first three of the registries there was

734
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:44,380
space allocated to legacy address

735
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:48,970
holders and you know it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

736
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:51,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way lawyers do it people applied to</font>

737
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:56,890
jon postel<font color="#CCCCCC"> and/or a series of government</font>

738
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:59,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">agencies for space and they got it for</font>

739
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:03,640
use and the terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are a little</font>

740
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:07,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit smoky and a little bit ambiguous and</font>

741
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:09,279
so it's it's it's it's it's a little bit

742
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,259
like if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one lawyer in a one</font>

743
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,990
lawyer town you're a very poor person

744
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:16,300
but if you're there are multiple lawyers

745
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:19,029
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the town</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they can take different</font>

746
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,880
positions then you could be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very rich</font>

747
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:25,680
lawyer and so I think there's going to

748
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:29,320
be a debate<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what the rights and</font>

749
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,660
powers that were given to the legacy

750
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,790
holders what are those powers what

751
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:36,850
duties do they have if any to the

752
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:39,460
Internet community what rights do they

753
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:41,890
have visa<font color="#CCCCCC"> V the community and we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

754
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,720
a little bit about this i will say that

755
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,980
in a recent agreement with the United

756
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,680

says that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States government</font>

00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,520
funded the creation of ipv4 they've said

767
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,250

<font color="#CCCCCC">know not every US government policy is</font>

780
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:44,830
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a reflection of that</font>

781
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:47,590
thought so in the legacy address space

782
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:50,350
area it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear that there's a</font>

786
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:05,400
entice potentially out some of that some

787
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:09,400
of that unused or underutilized space

788
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:15,369
and there are considerations about that

789
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:17,550
right now erin has had I've had the joy

790
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:20,650
is there anybody here from Microsoft

791
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:22,869
anyone I've had the joy of being the

792
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">only lawyer in America who says here's</font>

794
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:31,750
Microsoft in other words it's quite the

795
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">reverse of the usual relationship one</font>

796
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:37,990
has with Microsoft and I must say I've

797
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:39,970
enjoyed that inordinately and I have the

798
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:42,189
same relationship to all of the other

799

it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun to have that sort of a</font>

803
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:58,940
policy what we've done

804
00:39:54,930 --> 00:40:02,009
is aaron is proposing a legacy

805
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:05,400
registration services agreement and if

806
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:09,050
you lay the legacy registration service

807
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:12,480
agreement side by<font color="#CCCCCC"> side with our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

808
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:14,880
agreement that we make our brothers and

810
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,210
that the legacy service agreement is

811
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:24,960
very attractive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to legacy address</font>

812
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:29,059
holders and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean very attractive in</font>

813
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:33,089
the long run what the legacy RSA

814
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:35,760
promises is that if you sign up to be a

815
00:40:33,089 --> 00:40:38,549
part of the community which legacy

816
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,109
address holders currently are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

817
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:44,400
sense that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> receiving free</font>

818
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:45,900
services from registries like Aaron that

819
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,059
they'll get certain contractually

820
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,369
guaranteed rights and those

821
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:54,420
contractionary guaranteed rights include

822
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:57,510
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the promise that the community will</font>

823
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:00,030
not try in some way to invalidate their

824
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:04,500
holdings of legacy address space that

825
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:06,869
are unused it basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> requires that</font>

826
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,869
they pay a hundred dollars a year which

827
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:12,569
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal fee that we charge to make</font>

828
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:18,660
sure that we're in correct contact with

829
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:21,029
a POC of a corporation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it is it is</font>

830
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:23,970
truly I think if you reflect<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

831
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:26,180
differences<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the standard RSA and</font>

00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:30,930
the legacy RSA it's a very attractive

833
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:33,750
contractual package we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> debate</font>

834
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:36,960
whether that package should be more

835
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:38,549
attractive to legacy holders or more

836
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,339
fair to the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> members of the</font>

846
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:13,090
we look at this together it's my hope

847
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:16,060
that a good dialogue will result right

848
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:20,770
now that legacy RSA is posted there's

849
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:23,650
been I've read you know some posts that

850
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:26,170
indicate like the movie dr. Strangelove

851
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:27,700
where they're talking about shelter

852
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:29,650
space you know that they're coming to

853
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:31,240
take our shelter space way we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

legacy rights away what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are providing</font>

857
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:45,940
I think here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a voluntary totally</font>

858
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:48,850
voluntary a package that addresses what

859
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:51,670
we've been asked to do for the legacy

860
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:54,720
address community that would provide

861
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:57,700
strong contractual guarantees of future

862
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,790

this up we have good 15 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 12</font>

particular provision in the legacy RSA

867
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:13,720
I'm glad to try and address that for you

868
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,760
if I've said something<font color="#E5E5E5"> provocative</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as I</font>

869
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:18,009
obviously did earlier without realizing

870
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,400
it by talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> people versus</font>

871
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:24,430
policies you could feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> free to take me</font>

872
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,410
to task I<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate the attention that</font>

00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:28,660
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> given me this morning and I throw</font>

874
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:30,759
it open to you now for discussion good

875
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:33,609
and maybe I can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> it off that's</font>

876
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,680
right if and others head to the mics and

877
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:38,260
you'll be called upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> to speak your</font>

878
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,140
piece so given<font color="#CCCCCC"> the description that</font>

879
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:43,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've made of the legacy RSA offering</font>

880
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:46,540
it's not clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me why Aaron would</font>

881
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:47,860
want to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so what the legacy</font>

882
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,210
holds are secretly believe is that

883
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:53,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're coming to take their shelter</font>

884
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:54,790
space right right and so so why why does

885
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,560
Aaron want to do this if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a</font>

886
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:58,360
hundred dollars a year and they get more

887
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,730
rights and they get to keep all their

888
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:03,070
space there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a benefit to the</font>

889
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:07,480
community that everyone agrees to play

890
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:10,960
by the same rules as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> looked at RFC</font>

891
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,550
2050 legacy holders who are receiving

892
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,370
services ought to pay for those services

893
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:19,000
in my judgment in other words there's an

894
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:19,500
inequity in that the smallest<font color="#E5E5E5"> isp is</font>

895
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,630
paying

896
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:24,870
mean for the services that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive</font>

897
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:27,480
while legacy holders with a very large

898
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:30,089
block are paying nothing under the

899
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">current system so there's equity I think</font>

900
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:35,550
in the package but on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand</font>

901
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:37,290
there's no reason for people to fear

902
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:39,540
that their rights are being taken away I

903
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:41,610
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you read carefully the rights</font>

904
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:43,830
that are guaranteed there they're very

905
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:47,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">much consistent with what we understood</font>

906
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:49,290
legacy holders indicated would be the

907
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:51,450
right balance here i will<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that I've</font>

908
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:53,970
had a number of private communications

909
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:56,700
that say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the legacy RSA actually is</font>

910
00:44:53,970 --> 00:45:00,299
to beneficial to legacy holders that it

911
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:04,680
is unfair to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a normal registrants and of</font>

912
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:08,790
course we could debate that as well mr.

Houston Jeff Houston I'm the person who

914

00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:18,270
the AP neck area and certainly I've been

916
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:20,759
looking at this for some time one thing

917
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:22,350
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed was entirely absent in what</font>

919
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:27,240
relevant here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an observation</font>

920
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:29,070
about politics and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sociology of</font>

an attitude of 32 bits created so many

927
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:47,279
way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> operate it and we established an</font>

928
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:50,010
entire framework around the distribution

929
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these based on their abundance a lot</font>

930
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:54,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the documents</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you cite were based on</font>

931
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:56,069
that artifact that addresses were

932
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,870
plentiful we weren't rationing them we

933
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:59,940
weren't trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out the</font>

934
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:03,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">relative need of one party or another</font>

935
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:06,030
which is what rationing is all about

936
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:07,890
since the internet bus we've used the

937
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:10,410
words internet and failure many times

938
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:12,540
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> about to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it again because</font>

939
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:15,240
this situation we're in now was never

940
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:17,490
meant to happen we were never meant to

941
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,740
be in the rather strange place of

942
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:22,919
running out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these addresses without a</font>

were never meant to be

00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:37,279
here and what we're confronting is the

949
00:46:34,229 --> 00:46:40,589
exhaustion of a distribution framework

950
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:42,209
the rirs actually had two roles and we

951
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:45,150
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite understood the distinction</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">between the two there were operators of</font>

953
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:50,249
a distribution framework we gave out

954
00:46:47,279 --> 00:46:53,519
addresses but we also did something else

955
00:46:50,249 --> 00:46:56,669
which was implicit we understood and

956
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:59,999
indeed underpinned uniqueness it's the

957
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:01,950
registry that counts my right to use an

958
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:04,738
address is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a secret I mumble to</font>

myself in some deep and dark corner my

960
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:10,319
right to use an address and your right

961
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:12,839
not to use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is based on a public</font>

962
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:15,538
attestation and registry that that

965
00:47:18,299 --> 00:47:22,680
important artifact because that's what

966

makes routing work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what makes</font>

public attestation of uniqueness of

969

what are you going to do look around you

for authority on uniqueness at some

works in some ways it's trying to say

current framework is changing in terms

00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:10,349
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution but behind that the</font>

1009
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:13,288
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolute reliance on a registry system</font>

1010
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:17,009
that gives you a firm and solid

don't flow

1044

for legacy address space there are

1049
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:11,910
really two separate things happening one

1050
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:13,980
is trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the legacy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> holders in</font>

1051
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:15,839

register get that the Louise data

1054
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:22,470
correct etc etc and and try to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

1055
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:26,300
to pay for some of the services they're

1056
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:28,799
getting I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with that and</font>

1057
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,839
if it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be two hundred dollars</font>

1058
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:34,680
instead of a hundred dollars I have no

1059
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:36,808
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that the second part and is</font>

1060
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:39,808
totally intermixed with your with your

1061
00:51:36,809 --> 00:51:42,500
registry services agreement is all about

1062
00:51:39,809 --> 00:51:45,329
rights and what you happen to have

1063
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:47,760
section 9<font color="#CCCCCC"> available you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put on the</font>

1064
00:51:45,329 --> 00:51:50,400
screen since the last thing you said was

1065
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:52,290
it doesn't speak to<font color="#E5E5E5"> or ameliorate in any</font>

1066
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,450
way excuse me for paraphrasing I don't

1067
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:57,000
really remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> well at my age the</font>

1068
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:59,910
rights of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> legacy holders if you</font>

1069
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,349
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> put section 9 up there I can't but</font>

1070
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:05,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can read it to people with actually</font>

1071
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:08,040
almost ok 9 says no property rights

1072
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:09,990
legacy applicant acknowledges and agrees

1073
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:12,990
that the number of resources are not

1074
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:15,180
property real personal or intellectual

1075
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:18,839
and that the legacy applicant does not

1076
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:20,790
have any property rights in or to the

1077
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:23,369
included number of resources included

1078
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:26,040
but not limited to this legacy agreement

1079
00:52:23,369 --> 00:52:27,990
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough Randy that's enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1080
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,359
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does speak to what the</font>

1081
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:31,979
rights are I'm not arguing whether or

1082
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:33,598
not we have property rights I don't

1083
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:37,619
think we should have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that argument here</font>

1084
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:40,190
but the fact is it does make us clear

1085
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:42,809
very clear statement amelioration of

1086
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:45,960
what the legacy holders property rights

1087
00:52:42,809 --> 00:52:49,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">are so I believe your last statement is</font>

1088
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:52,730
quite incorrect hi Randy took six

1089
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:54,660
minutes approximately and and I

1090
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:55,920
appreciate that he didn't ask any

1091
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:59,308
questions either but I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1092
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">comment Randy would you mind and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1093
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:03,450
know how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel about this so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1094
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:04,359
say yes or no would you tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> people how</font>

1095
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:07,210
much of your

1096
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:17,470
legacy address block is being used or

1097
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:19,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so the question is would Aaron tell</font>

1098
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:20,890
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> who the top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are who get</font>

1099
00:53:19,269 --> 00:53:22,988
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> seventy-five percent of the address</font>

1100
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:24,430
space first of all I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1101
00:53:22,989 --> 00:53:26,230
figures correct but assuming it is

1102
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:28,149
correct why don't we raise it at the air

1103
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:29,710
in meeting and I'll certainly look at

1104
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:32,799
whether there's any reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why we can't</font>

1105
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:35,380
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can I'd like to with</font>

1106
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:37,829
regard to paragraph<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine which you just</font>

1107
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:41,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me to read and that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel is</font>

1108
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:43,509
somehow inappropriate obviously or

1109
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:45,819
inconsistent with<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the philosophy</font>

1110
00:53:43,509 --> 00:53:48,039
that I expressed let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say the</font>

1111
00:53:45,819 --> 00:53:50,769
paragraph nine would put legacy address

1112
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:53,380
holders on the same footing as the other

1113
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:56,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">twelve thousand people with regard to</font>

1114
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:59,049
acknowledging that they do not own the

1115
00:53:56,499 --> 00:54:01,419
IP as property but they own the

1116
00:53:59,049 --> 00:54:03,489
beneficial right to use it and I think

1117
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:06,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perfectly appropriate and I think</font>

1118
00:54:03,489 --> 00:54:08,559
actually it's it's in many ways

1119
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:11,380
necessary to level the playing ground

1120
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:13,809
between legacy address holders and those

1121
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,950
who are within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> running</font>

out of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're going to do these</font>

1123
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:19,960
two who are at the mic and then wrap up

1124
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:23,259
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> andrew dahl I work for Perkins</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kui</font>

1125
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:26,680
we have a legacy / 24 that is largely

1126
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:31,839
utilized the question I'd like to ask is

1127
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:34,598
the legacy par sa which I appreciate

1128
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:38,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Aaron Aaron board went and produced</font>

1129
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:39,730
and actually published one of the things

1130
00:54:38,259 --> 00:54:41,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think has come out on the mailing</font>

list and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> realize this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not the same</font>

1132
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:46,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">form as the Aaron meeting but we're here</font>

1133
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:50,410
discussing it is that aaron has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

1134
00:54:46,869 --> 00:54:54,130
strong ground and bottom-up policy

1135
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:56,739
decision process and one of the things

1136

<font color="#CCCCCC">that's come out in the meeting is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or on</font>

00:54:56,739 --> 00:55:04,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the mailing list is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a draft</font>

1138
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:07,329
of the policy or this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy that</font>

1139
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:10,839
legacy space holders will have to sign

1140
00:55:07,329 --> 00:55:15,099
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have is if legacy space</font>

1141
00:55:10,839 --> 00:55:18,729
holders provide constructive feedback

1142
00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:20,979
and you know rational changes that they

1143
00:55:18,729 --> 00:55:24,910

1164
00:56:19,989 --> 00:56:24,549
all it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the intention of the Aaron</font>

board to evaluate the input that they

1167
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:32,589
even weeks and then to finalize the RSA

00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:35,379
in other words we're not open for

00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:40,210
a special deal for anyone who would like

00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:42,009
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that in the interim I think it's a</font>

1172
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:45,009
very important point like an

1173
00:56:42,009 --> 00:56:47,079
Administrative Procedure rule making you

1174
00:56:45,009 --> 00:56:48,999
put out the proposed rule and then you

1175
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:51,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask for comments about it so I think</font>

1176
00:56:48,999 --> 00:56:54,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">with regard to this the Aaron board is</font>

1177
00:56:51,339 --> 00:56:56,890
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that let me say ultimately</font>

1178
00:56:54,009 --> 00:56:58,869
though that the the agreement<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Aaron</font>

1179
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:01,538
puts out there has to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision of</font>

1180
00:56:58,869 --> 00:57:04,960
its board because you can't ask people

1181
00:57:01,539 --> 00:57:07,269
what contract they would like ultimately

1182
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,680
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> may differ on their opinions</font>

1183
00:57:07,269 --> 00:57:12,700
about that contract it's not a

1184
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:14,979
plebiscite issue where proposals for

1185
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:18,368
policies that govern the community can

1186
00:57:14,979 --> 00:57:20,919
be so there's an overlap of what's in a

1187
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:23,619
contract and what is policy and the

1188
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:26,109
policy has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> consistent with the</font>

1189
00:57:23,619 --> 00:57:28,539
contract or the contract has to change

1190
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:31,449
we have had nine versions

00:57:34,229 --> 00:57:39,848
new thoughts and challenges occur one of

the things i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aaron board is</font>

if we make a change subsequent to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more beneficial to legacy</font>

1202
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:06,249

people who sign to have the benefits of

1204
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:11,799
any changes later that they wish and

<font color="#E5E5E5">that would be a wish not required so it</font>

generation legacy address holders who

00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:23,618
sign yes the last question I actually

1209
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:27,729
statement than a question as one of the

1210
00:58:23,619 --> 00:58:30,400
authors of RFC 2050 I have to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1211
00:58:27,729 --> 00:58:32,288
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most stunning aspects of the</font>

1212
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,539
discussions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have occurred on the</font>

1213
00:58:32,289 --> 00:58:40,209
issues relating to addressing recently

1214
00:58:34,539 --> 00:58:45,839
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been the assertion that somehow 2050</font>

1215
00:58:40,209 --> 00:58:49,629
is is a legal<font color="#CCCCCC"> document or the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implied</font>

1216
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:54,130
legality of that specific best<font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

1217
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:55,989
practice when 2050 was written in 1996

1218
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:59,169
the rirs were just becoming established

1219
00:58:55,989 --> 00:59:02,229
and it was known at the time of<font color="#CCCCCC"> writing</font>

1220
00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:04,658
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a current practice and if</font>

1221
00:59:02,229 --> 00:59:09,249
you read 2050 there is a statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

1222
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:11,890
the beginning excuse me by the iesg

1223
00:59:09,249 --> 00:59:16,149
saying they will revisit this to see if

1224
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:18,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">it currently applies in 1997 in 1997</font>

1225
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:20,529
when that revisiting occurred it was

1226
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,839
determined that policy regarding

1227
00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:25,959
addressing should not be made within the

1228
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:30,279
IDF<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be made within the RIR</font>

1229
00:59:25,959 --> 00:59:32,828
structures the fact that we're trotting

1230
00:59:30,279 --> 00:59:37,440
out 2050 as some sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> brit from</font>

heaven by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the st. John pastel is</font>

1232
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:45,089
just very surprising<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me the question</font>

1233
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:46,770
is in two years well we will you yield

1234
00:59:45,089 --> 00:59:49,410
before it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask should we just make a</font>

1235
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:53,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">quick point i think the importance of</font>

1236
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:57,029
2050 and 2008 is to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> the continuity</font>

1237
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:59,250
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current legal regime with the</font>

1238
00:59:57,030 --> 01:00:02,099
policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were approved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at that time</font>

1239
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:06,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">a standard setting I don't remember that</font>

1240
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:10,319
that that those standards have been

1241
01:00:06,859 --> 01:00:12,480
ignored thereafter by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR community</font>

1242
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:14,730
in other words the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR community now can</font>

1243
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:18,089
depart from those they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have policy</font>

1244
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:21,030
bottom ups bottom-up policy processes to

1245
01:00:18,089 --> 01:00:23,190
do that but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an ethical</font>

1246
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:26,460
not necessarily always a legal issue

1247
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:29,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people got resources from</font>

1248
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:32,069
jon postel under understandings that are

1249
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:34,950
not written<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lawyers didn't</font>

1250
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:37,050
write the contract between<font color="#CCCCCC"> Postel and</font>

1251
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:39,118
the legacy address holders so what I

1252
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:41,520
find interesting is legacy address

1253
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:44,190
holders saying treat me like a lawyer

1254
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:46,259
when frankly jon postel did not treat

1255
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:48,180
them like a lawyer at the time there

1256
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:51,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">were certain common understandings and</font>

1257
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:53,129
what I've tried to do and using<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2050 is</font>

1258
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,069
to drive at what were those common

1259
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:58,800
understandings and so I'm not citing it

1260
01:00:56,069 --> 01:01:01,740
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal document but frankly as one</font>

1261
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:05,130
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it describes I think the</font>

1262
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:09,479
ethical climate in which the legacy

1263
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:14,730
address holders received their grant of

1264
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:19,020
IP resources all right so yeah very

1265
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:22,200
quickly so in two years by reasonable

1266
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:26,009
estimates the ipv4 address pool will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1267

consumed you do not apparently from at

1268
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:29,069
least from the slides that you presented

1269
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:31,920
believe that Anna market is the right

01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:17,240
deliver a market that works if that's

1286
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,350
the intention of the community or

1287
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:22,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that will transition very</font>

1289
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:26,670
that's the intention of the community so

1290
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:28,500
truly I don't have a personal position

1291
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:32,300
on that yet because my client hasn't

1292
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:32,300
told me it thanks
