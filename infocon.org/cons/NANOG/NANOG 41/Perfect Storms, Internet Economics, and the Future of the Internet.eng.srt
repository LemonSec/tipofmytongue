1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:06,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright thanks um so what's all this</font>

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,160
about um let me just dive into this and

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe we'll figure it out here basically</font>

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,950
here's my agenda for this talk I'm a

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,450
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of background in context</font>

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,579
about what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about what this</font>

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,369
perfect storm thing is about what the

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,750
three pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the puddle puzzle are</font>

9
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:22,259
few considerations and maybe some

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,539
discussion so um I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">many of you know this is like continuing</font>

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,539
my controversial at nanog but as

13
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,670
many of you know I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been spending a</font>

14
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,289
lot of time studying complexity and what

15
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,989
it meant for networks and our designs

16
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:36,420
and all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff we did this panel</font>

17
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:40,890
I don't know now 26 it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the distant</font>

18
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:44,489
past now and we did our receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 3439</font>

19
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,590
and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my work at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco i was</font>

20
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,410
looking at in things like ngn and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am</font>

21
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,770
asked and um<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did a talk about that too</font>

22
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,190
at nana 33<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess because when i saw it</font>

23
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">i went more what is this thing and so as</font>

24
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,539
you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine let's see oh this</font>

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,780
isn't work too well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I exported these</font>

26
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,129
slides from keynote so anyway I started

27
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,049
wondering where all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff was going</font>

28
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,110
and what it meant for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

29
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,900
Internet at large and more and more

30
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:15,060
directly for operational considerations

31
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,970
how things like I a master and an GN

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,100
would interact with the architecture<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

33
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,080
what the implications of these um what

34
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm calling policy based networks and</font>

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,170
what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean by that is really</font>

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,220
basically these access high-touch access

37
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,350
networks um and here's the key thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

38
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,229
was wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know what are</font>

39
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">the implications of trying to tie</font>

40
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:37,679
perceived high-margin application

41
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,030
revenue directly to the packet transport

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,700
which is what these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are trying to</font>

43
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,990
do so I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

44
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,979
the question really becomes can you

45
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,329
really do that with the internet

46
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,729
architecture and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

47
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,649
trying but you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what happens</font>

48
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,649
if you try and here's the hint things

49
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,140
get complicated but so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

50
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,000
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but we'll see in a second</font>

51
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,079
sorry about the slides again um we'll

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,469
see in a second why this becomes

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,389
interesting but as you might imagine you

54
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,740
know those of you who know me I was

55
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty skeptical of all of this stuff</font>

56
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,169
and in analyzing this space a bit I I

57
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,609
proposed this scenario and it's a simple

58
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,790
scenario you'll see in a second but it

59
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,260
somehow you

60
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,519
men yelling it and I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey there's</font>

61
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,129
sort of a perfect storm<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there and</font>

62
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,239
also I owned it so a better I'm sure

63
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:21,730
there's a better name for this but

64
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,989
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how this came to be and the rest</font>

65
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:27,429
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk is just going to review</font>

66
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:34,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so what exactly is this well it's</font>

67
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:35,980
some crummy slides um um<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a it's a</font>

68
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:37,900
bunch of officer it's a few observations

69
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,328
three basic events that could really

70
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,790
lead<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a restructuring of the industry</font>

71
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:45,099
or lead to or is causing depending on

72
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,319
how you see it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically they're</font>

73
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:49,480
these three things<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-margin yet</font>

74
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,089
profitable IP packet carriage businesses

75
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,340
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> emerge already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exist this is what</font>

76
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,590
all of this ngn stuff was trying to say

77
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,180
hey we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put all this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

78
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-touch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff into our core networks</font>

79
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,379
because we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to be profitable</font>

80
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,730
what I'm suggesting what with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

81
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:07,090
see what this means in a second but this

82
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:09,069
is sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that oh well maybe</font>

83
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,579
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you could be profitable even</font>

84
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:14,168
if margins were slim um the second piece

85
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:17,109
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is access monopolies get</font>

86
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:18,129
weakened or<font color="#CCCCCC"> cease</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to exist that's you</font>

87
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:20,109
will see in a second that's pretty

88
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:22,569
controversial as well and the third

89
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:24,729
piece was something you can't read I

90
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,228
guess but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a set of</font>

91
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:28,030
peer-to-peer applications emerged that

92
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:29,979
basically co-opted these big revenue

93
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,459
streams that that while they are

94
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:36,220
themselves diminishing a bit they're

95
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,840
still out there so what so it's a set of

96
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,269
observations right these three

97
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">observations about the trajectory and</font>

98
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:44,500
state of the current internet and it

99
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:46,750
involves economics public policy

100
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,190
technology and importantly the internet

101
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,090
architecture that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we're all here</font>

102
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,799
and it's based on you know it's set it's

103
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,859
based on the end-to-end principle when

104
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:59,169
it's all said and done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know we</font>

105
00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:01,030
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue about every like everyone else</font>

106
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:03,609
about what the Indian<font color="#E5E5E5"> principle really</font>

107
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,290
says and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah see that see that</font>

108
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:07,930
reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of the canonical</font>

109
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:12,280
reference i think on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and end but here's</font>

110
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:15,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">the key feature um well the key feature</font>

111
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not that it over wrote the title but</font>

112
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,259
the key feature is that if you do IP

113
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:21,399
package<font color="#E5E5E5"> carried packet carriage in the</font>

114
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:24,160
core of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network it's going to be a</font>

115
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:26,620
commodity business and we'll see why

116
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,970
you know if you want the intuition on it

117
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,370
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the end to end</font>

118
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">principle puts the value on the edges of</font>

119
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,510
the network not in the core and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

120
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,909
note that this conclusion may be

121
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:40,270
considered controversial by some or many

122
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,680
um and it also doesn't mean that there

123
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,570
isn't margin in and say you know

124
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,760
carrying 2547 or something like that

125
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,440
obviously there is but that's just such

126
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,469
a tiny part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the traffic mix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

127
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,530
out there today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so let's let's look</font>

128
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,820
at this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a little more detail so</font>

129
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,770
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by this emergence of a</font>

130
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:00,520
low-margin yet profitable<font color="#CCCCCC"> package</font>

131
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,859
carriage<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah should the the hypothesis</font>

132
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,870
here that is that a direct consequence

133
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,280
of the end end principle is that it's a

134
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,450
commodity package carriage is a

135
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:12,400
commodity and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can say it</font>

136
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,539
differently IP architecture dictates

137
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,380
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher margin value</font>

138
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:19,120
propositions on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge so you know you</font>

139
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,469
can conclude sort of if you believe this

140
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,120
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're in the packet transport</font>

141
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,130
biz I<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you're</font>

142
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,900
transporting bulk or wholesale IP or

143
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,040
whatever you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call it you're</font>

145
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,950
probably going to wind up having to make

146
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,360
your living in that kind of a low-margin

147
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:36,310
environment and here's where that here's

148
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,450
where this all came from<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my own</font>

149
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking is is that you can really</font>

150
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,200
contrast this with the activity around

151
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,620
say all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the SIOP marked in packet</font>

153
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,990

154
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,580
but anyway um and not surprisingly

155
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's all kinds of disagreement on</font>

156
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:57,849
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point especially especially in the</font>

157
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,830
case of IP people and telco people

158
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,090
discussing this but what's the

159
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,039
relationship between commodity

160
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,080
businesses and margin structures you ask

161
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">i I to go learn this because I didn't</font>

162
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,680
understand all of this stuff I still I

163
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,600
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel them quite an expert on it</font>

164
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,130
but I'm getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> better but basically the</font>

165
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,600
classic commodity businesses are

166
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,640
capitalized by these significant capital

167
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,990
expenditures and their<font color="#E5E5E5"> plants and low</font>

168
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,330
profit margins and a bunch of

169
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:23,080
competition well I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

170
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:26,349
sounds familiar right we see not and you

171
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,909
know in all of these cases if you want

172
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,410
to if you want to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of analyze this</font>

173
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,720
you have to also look at whether or not

174
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:34,360
you can get cap if if you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

175
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,610
capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if not then upfront</font>

176
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,280
requirements will form a barrier can

177
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,630
free you know

178
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,888
like in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases not everybody's</font>

179
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,540
putting that submarine cables or

180
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:43,490
whatever and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will reduce or</font>

181
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,530
eliminate competition which some people

182
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,270
think is a good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you also have</font>

184
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,919
thing can't read this but basically in

185
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,880
some cases especially in the case of

186
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">incumbent access providers um adding</font>

187
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,850
capacity to their networks could be

188
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,349
significantly whether you know lower

189
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,450
than when it costs a new entrant and

190
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,490
that could that a cause that can cause

191
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:10,190
incumbents to squeeze out<font color="#CCCCCC"> competition to</font>

192
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:11,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh another property is that they of</font>

193
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:13,790
classic commodities is frequently cited

194
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,320
is that they have this property that the

195
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,580
incremental cost of providing the good

196
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,860
or service that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide</font>

197
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,289
approaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero or the marginal cost us</font>

198
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,880
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask yourself</font>

199
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,350
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is the incremental cost of</font>

200
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,440
forwarding a packet in your core network

201
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:30,110
well it's kind of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero right so</font>

202
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,570
it's the lack of differentiation a core

203
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,340
you know qos anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think so but</font>

204
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,950
and the intense competition out there

205
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,679
has driven us all to low low margins

206
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,690
which over time with reduced plant<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

207
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">says durban incremental costs down so</font>

208
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,850
we're seeing classic commodity behavior

209
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:50,030
here that's the point here um so okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

210
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:51,260
it's a classic commodity well you could

211
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,880
kind of deduce that from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-to-end</font>

212
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">principle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already right I mean it's just</font>

213
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,440
that it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some economic</font>

214
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,789
foundation behind that so we know we

215
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,740
also know that margins are going to

216
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:03,020
naturally be pretty thin so the

217
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,820
conclusion here and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the</font>

218
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,340
antithesis of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conclusion of the ngn</font>

219
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:10,520
work but the conclusion here is that

220
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,960
ESPYs need to be profitable<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a lo Mart</font>

221
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,370
and a commodity or low margin

222
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,950
environment if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

223
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">viable and vibrant business environment</font>

224
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,000
and the important point here is that the

225
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,350
high-margin proposition isn't in the

226
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,970
packet transport so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is all</font>

227
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,470
really all about I mean when<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

228
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the day what it's really all about is</font>

229
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,710
we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet technology the</font>

230
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,570
architecture sky and in principle in it

231
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,728
that's what made it so powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

232
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,469
what we want to be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is looking</font>

233
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:40,750
at the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the convolution of all of</font>

234
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:44,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">that on technology with the economics of</font>

235
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">of packet transport itself and this is</font>

236
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,750
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key here we want to</font>

237
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,209
simultaneously preserve to end<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

238
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,870
nature<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's</font>

239
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:52,160
where all

240
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">where all the goodness has come from and</font>

241
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,449
have viable economics at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time</font>

242
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,920
normally what people say to me is what

243
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,420
you don't want my<font color="#E5E5E5"> cot you don't want my</font>

244
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,589
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be profitable of course we</font>

245
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,650
want everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be profitable that's</font>

246
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:08,360
up to deal so low margin but profitable

247
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:10,220
IP packet carriage this is my kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

248
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,980
aside on this in case you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering</font>

249
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,320
um the economics of all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

250
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:19,190
as clearest and about as well understood

251
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,480
as the network complexity issues so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

252
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,890
need to you can't see the bottom of this

253
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,720
but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the things we need to</font>

254
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,180
do here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is encouraged multidisciplinary</font>

255
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,210
research in this area<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can get up</font>

256
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:32,060
so we can get some I would call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

257
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,950
cross-pollination amongst among the

258
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:36,920
various disciplines that are involved

259
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,810
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is a second thing so</font>

260
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,000
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this thing okay somebody becomes</font>

261
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,229
profitable in a low-margin environment

262
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,490
they learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it we all learn how</font>

263
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:48,290
to do it second thing access monopolies

264
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,910
well you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are new technologies</font>

265
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,349
out there say why max I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

266
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,420
know why<font color="#E5E5E5"> max is the one but you know</font>

267
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">just something I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just wrote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one out</font>

268
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">there or just plain competition and the</font>

269
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:59,839
axis will help and then there's things

270
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:02,859
like 700 megahertz and what's going on

271
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you I'd UMTS and things like that</font>

272
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:09,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a little truth in advertising</font>

273
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:10,670
here um some folks have posited that the

274
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:14,060
competition<font color="#CCCCCC"> the access is really</font>

275
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:16,579
effectively impossible because uh its

276
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,319
capital intensive and it's a natural

277
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,060
monopoly it's like we said on the other

278
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,740
page that's what some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are saying</font>

279
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,270
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is you're not gonna be</font>

280
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to say this but basically there's</font>

281
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,520
no there's no technology wireless or

282
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:29,810
other what no wireless or

283
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,540
non-traditional access technology that

284
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:35,000
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now that's inexpensive say</font>

285
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,949
wireless that allows you now say get 10

286
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,020
or 100 HD channels to your handset or

287
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,790
wherever you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take it so those</font>

288
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:44,350
are those are technology challenges that

289
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:47,750
are out there but why is this important

290
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:50,300
well competitions make makes it less

291
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,100
much harder or impossible to profitably

292
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,900
feel these pack these policy based

293
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,310
networks run around calling these policy

294
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,850
based networks are these<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-touch edge</font>

295
00:10:55,310 --> 00:11:00,439
networks but why is this true well first

296
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,700
off you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider the cost of</font>

297
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,650
building and running one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these things</font>

298
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,339
and given its complexity they're very

299
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,990
complex

300
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:08,689
and they're given that complexity its

301
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,720
reliability so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that costs</font>

302
00:11:08,689 --> 00:11:13,939
has to go somewhere goes to the consumer

303
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,559
and you know there's no way that the you

304
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,879
know in ESP as good as they are are

305
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:18,379
going to be able to innovate at the same

306
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,819
rate as the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet does that's</font>

307
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:22,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">the whole power of the thing right and</font>

308
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:25,309
then principal again shut surprisingly

309
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:27,230
and you have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the success of</font>

310
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:29,329
something like AOL or other attempted

311
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:33,259
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're all got walled garden</font>

312
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:35,029
providers um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just the</font>

313
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,980
editorial comments saying you know then

314
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:39,769
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we trying to do I ms there's a</font>

315
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:43,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason for that too or things like it so</font>

316
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:45,620
uh gosh that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not too good what are the</font>

317
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:47,420
implications of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of this this is the</font>

318
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,160
real controversial statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have in</font>

319
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,139
the in here is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> these policy based</font>

320
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,389
networks and now i'm talking about

321
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:56,269
suppose you<font color="#CCCCCC"> filled ims or something like</font>

322
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:58,249
it where the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just explicitly to</font>

323
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:00,370
try to tie application revenue to the

324
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:03,079
packet transport in the access network

325
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:05,680
these things are really costly to build

326
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:08,239
and operate they're less reliable and

327
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,449
this is the irony<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're less service</font>

328
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,429
rich well why do they cost more

329
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:15,079
complexity why are they less reliable

330
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:17,600
complexity why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they less service</font>

331
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:19,779
slip risk well stay tuned well these

332
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,059
slides really<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't transfer very well</font>

333
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:25,370
so again this is about now you have

334
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:27,139
internet technology you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access</font>

335
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,749
technology and you have public policy

336
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:31,399
because the access access is where all

337
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this public policy activity is</font>

338
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:35,839
happening so it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like net</font>

339
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:38,269
neutrality<font color="#CCCCCC"> plus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plus or something and of</font>

340
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,279
course you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the access networks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

341
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:43,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">must be profitable under some models so</font>

342
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,600
there's there's also this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also about</font>

343
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:47,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know how do we how do we produce</font>

344
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,620
viable business model set fruit for

345
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,889
access providers that preserve the

346
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:53,269
properties that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and of</font>

347
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:55,129
course people there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

348
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:56,420
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that access network</font>

349
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:58,550
infrastructure or even long-haul

350
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,189
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be some sort of</font>

351
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:05,929
public public good you know such as the

352
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:07,899
roads or whatever so the most basic

353
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:10,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">question in all of this to me anyway is</font>

354
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:11,889
given all of that how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we handle the</font>

355
00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:14,569
next wave of access bandwidth

356
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:15,580
requirements say you know if you had I p

357
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:18,130
HDTV or

358
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:21,430
something and how will future upgrades

359
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,890
to those plants be funded and which

360
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,329
technologies you know so suffice it to

361
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,569
say here's the point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a</font>

362
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,800
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Daryl there are many real</font>

363
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,990
technology business model and public

364
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,180
policy issues in here and I think all of

365
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:37,630
those need more study and more

366
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,829
multidisciplinary work so here's my

367
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,710
earlier question why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> these less</font>

368
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:43,660
service rich well gosh this is too bad

369
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:47,230
um so suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> your walled garden</font>

370
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:49,390
policy-based SP self history hit you

371
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:52,030
know history is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guide here right so</font>

372
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:53,800
innovation on the edge will force you

373
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,199
the wall<font color="#E5E5E5"> gutter garden provider to let</font>

374
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,150
new services through why well because

375
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:03,400
your customers will demand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because</font>

376
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:05,350
why because the and the end principle is

377
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,790
giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> us this innovation on the edge so</font>

378
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,300
that canonical case for that is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

379
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:12,760
port 80 and 443 and this is part of the

380
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason why exists and some in the</font>

381
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,520
existence of competition the access is

382
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,130
so important<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if we don't have</font>

383
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:21,400
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you don't have any choice</font>

384
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:23,260
that's a consumer and of course once you

385
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,240
let any port through everything can be

386
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,340
tunneled and that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great aspect of</font>

387
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,400
internet architecture gives us some<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

388
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,410
democratizing right and here's some

389
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:36,850
examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> skypes or anything skypes there</font>

390
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:40,689
anything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's over the top so why</font>

391
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:44,770
are they less service rich still um gosh

392
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:46,480
well sorry um you basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't do</font>

393
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,310
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it you can't do anything</font>

394
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,470
about it in the access network case

395
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,479
because what people have tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

396
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,040
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to field these policy based</font>

397
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,890
networks that stop you for doing any

398
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything that's not your service and</font>

399
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,590
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's done with the DPI</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> engines</font>

400
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,190
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of deep packet inspection</font>

401
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:05,200
technology and but you can't really use

402
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the reason why is because</font>

403
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,320
you might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find the signature</font>

404
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,540
of something like encrypted voice today

405
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,930
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> um but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically you have to block</font>

406
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:16,060
everything that you can't identify and

407
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:18,430
so that means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um everything that's</font>

408
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,469
over the top has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> treated by</font>

409
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:22,780
default logic right so either you have

410
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,860
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow nothing temporarily because you</font>

411
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,360
can't do that forever because your

412
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,529
customers will demand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't or</font>

413
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,509
everything

414
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:30,490
and the conclusion is you can't really

415
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:32,649
effectively stop over the top over the

416
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:34,689
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not possible to</font>

417
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:35,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it if there's competition in the</font>

418
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:37,689
access of course if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

419
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:39,339
competition then your your your wedded

420
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:43,110
to whoever whoever you access provider

421
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:45,339
is and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have choices there and</font>

422
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,740
you really do need something that's like

423
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:48,730
roughly analogous to Carter phone I

424
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,949
don't know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people know what that is</font>

425
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,949
but somebody was bold enough to build a

426
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:55,300
phone that was an AT&T back in 68 or so

427
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:57,699
and tried to bolt it to the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

428
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,819
it took the supreme court to resolve the

429
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:02,529
fact that you can put any device onto

430
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:05,319
the network I mean you can't imagine

431
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,819
today having your access provider tell

432
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:08,469
you what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of computer you can have</font>

433
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:10,089
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what essentially is going on</font>

434
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:15,850
in the wireless world so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really</font>

435
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:17,649
have Carter<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone for wireless yet it's</font>

436
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,899
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the third piece of</font>

437
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:21,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">the puzzle and this this is pretty</font>

438
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:22,899
obvious applications emerged that target

439
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,870
you know revenue streams are the

440
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:27,459
incumbents right so they captured

441
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,779
revenue streams<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so end and</font>

442
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:30,369
principal again because you can do this

443
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,990
on the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> end you can do this end end</font>

444
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,800
and the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is this decentralized</font>

445
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:38,559
control nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> owns the control of say</font>

446
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,359
some peer-to-peer network and voice was

447
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,399
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one it was easy it was large</font>

448
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,829
it was relatively<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily co-opted by</font>

449
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,100
someone like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Skype or whoever vonage</font>

450
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:50,529
what's left of it you know Sarah but it

451
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:53,709
you know it goes on to video<font color="#CCCCCC"> fmc</font>

452
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:55,389
presents all of this stuff and so the

453
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:57,430
current the only current strategy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see</font>

454
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,870
against this is bundling service

455
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,128
bundling is the hedge that people are

456
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,649
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I don't see how that can hold</font>

457
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:06,189
up either because there's a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

458
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:07,898
just providing those bundles so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

459
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:10,120
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now we have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

460
00:17:07,898 --> 00:17:12,010
technology again and in nature and all

461
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:13,510
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and traditional carrier</font>

462
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:17,470
architectures and business models that

463
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:18,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">are clashing here and the particular the</font>

464
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,740
particular thing I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

465
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:22,599
here is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> while traditional carrier</font>

466
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,399
networks were very vertically integrated

467
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:26,049
the network was the application the

468
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:28,000
Internet's horizontally integrated right

469
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:29,889
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has the effect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of making</font>

470
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,450
what used to be a service that you sold

471
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,710
on your network into an application and

472
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,120
voice is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the one you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

473
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:39,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">about so</font>

474
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,320
what happens ok so now somebody now

475
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody or some set of providers are</font>

476
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,980
profitable and low margin<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment so</font>

477
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,300
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> end end nature the network's</font>

478
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,850
preserved<font color="#CCCCCC"> their in the long haul</font>

479
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,490
transport there's no out there's a

480
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:54,649
weekender access no none or weakened

481
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,780
access monopolies so competition from

482
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,910
you for that and there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> large-scale</font>

483
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:02,360
co-opting of traditional carrier service

484
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,800
provider revenue streams by point

485
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:08,330
peer-to-peer applications or whatever

486
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:10,309
else is out there so does our will<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

487
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,649
industry restructure under such a

488
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:14,420
scenario and how that's the question of

489
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:17,270
all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that's the that's the endgame</font>

490
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,590
question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of this and we know this</font>

491
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,139
stuff happens and it happens rapidly

492
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:23,840
right given the technology that we that

493
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,950
we built and deployed and the example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

494
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,290
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use is the recording industry</font>

495
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:29,179
because the this this is the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

496
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:31,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">I that when I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this is that</font>

497
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I really doubt that anybody in</font>

498
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,559
you know an RCA or Sony records was

499
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,000
sitting around going hmm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's</font>

500
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> create a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peer networking that</font>

501
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,720
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably cause my entire industry</font>

502
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,199
to restructure I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guarantee you nobody</font>

503
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:48,320
was thinking that but it certainly has

504
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,670
and it happened pretty pretty pretty so

505
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,139
the question people always ask me when

506
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,929
I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how much of</font>

507
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:58,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already out there and is it</font>

508
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:59,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">really kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an EF this happens um so</font>

509
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,070
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't a kind of an</font>

510
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,590
aside but when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making the slides I</font>

511
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:05,480
i was listening to CNBC and Kramer was

512
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,980
talking about well how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you detect</font>

513
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,860
when the market<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottomed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font>

514
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:11,690
occurring and what he said was you have

515
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:12,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to watch the front page of The Wall</font>

516
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,860
Street Journal and he said some things

517
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:18,110
about where things have occurred on the

518
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,969
wall street journal as signals well I

519
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,340
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I get to my office and I</font>

520
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,740
had a copy of telecommunications in my

521
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,290
mailbox right and so I was I went back

522
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:30,200
and I looked at this and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jim</font>

523
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:32,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is june two thousand and six so</font>

524
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:36,050
kind of a year ago right I a mess<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

525
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">know stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that this is this is</font>

526
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:41,030
what was in my mailbox you know it's

527
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you look at that I go home now</font>

528
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:45,200
maybe it's the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you know it's</font>

529
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,428
like uh people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to think see</font>

530
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,440
what's really happening out here so I

531
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:50,000
found<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of interesting</font>

532
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,530
but there's a catch tell this to as

533
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,200
always right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this breaks down</font>

534
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:58,490
when capacity when when we're out of

535
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,110
capacity whatever to mention the

536
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,140
capacity is because then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

537
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,610
upgrade plants and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you macked out</font>

538
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,920
maxed out your fiber you're feared

539
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:09,020
whatever it is at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> point there can</font>

540
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,630
be non-linear costs and this is why we

541
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,190
need you know okay this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what I'm talk</font>

542
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,380
about fiber bills forklift upgrades

543
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,870
whatever they are so we need economic

544
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,730
models that both preserve the IP

545
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:23,750
architecture and provided sufficient our

546
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:25,040
ally to sustain industry and and it you

547
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,470
know this what's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

548
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:31,550
this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to we need</font>

549
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:35,870
to meld our our operational technology

550
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:38,899
and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more theoretical um work</font>

551
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:41,179
together is seems to be taking off in a

552
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,640
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> areas like I heard ray</font>

553
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:46,370
mentioned that there'll be some talk

554
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,020
about um IP markets that's the thing

555
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:51,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> economists really need to look at</font>

556
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,730
and help us with you know and you know

557
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,930
in case you think the bandwidth some

558
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,190
people think well bandwidth you know

559
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,960
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always this whole thing about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

560
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,490
the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bandwidth the internet</font>

561
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,040
uses is doubling every week or every

562
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,720
month I looked at I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> got seenus the</font>

563
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,970
immense homepage it's pretty interesting

564
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,010
but you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this there's</font>

565
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,480
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's growing at you know</font>

566
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,560
if it's growing at fifty percent per

567
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,070
year that's pretty that's pretty

568
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:15,169
significant<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's all good</font>

569
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:16,340
that's a nice nice view<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it that's</font>

570
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,840
what kind of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all</font>

571
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,570
goodness is stating the obvious but

572
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,860
what's an ISP supposed to do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

573
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,750
well this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a crummy slide</font>

574
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,189
apparently but you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to you</font>

575
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,460
know one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do is you can</font>

576
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:29,810
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> be realistic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the optics</font>

577
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,250
complexity trade-offs I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

578
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:33,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that wasn't being done</font>

579
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,090
during all the years that people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

580
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:38,960
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> from virgins they just were not</font>

581
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:41,120
being realistic oh yeah so I heard Vijay

582
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,750
say this you know he said the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best thing</font>

583
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,070
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do is be rational and obviously</font>

584
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,570
we need better tools here because we

585
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">just have little or no analytical</font>

586
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:53,570
capability in this play in this space

587
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:55,159
and while we're thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we</font>

588
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

589
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,670
know governments can intervene or

590
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:00,470
regulators can intervene and that's a

591
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:05,490
trump card

592
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:07,830
so you as operators from my perspective

593
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,690
should work with vendors standards

594
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:12,810
organizations open source community to

595
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,850
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a platforms and protocols that</font>

596
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:17,250
have these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of needed properties</font>

597
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:20,129
that will let<font color="#E5E5E5"> us get there so what</font>

598
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,930
should vendors be doing well listen to

599
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:25,490
the ESPYs when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys tell us this</font>

600
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:27,540
stuff first off that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a notice happen</font>

601
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:29,970
but this problem is kind of thorny

602
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:34,020
because vendors like everyone want to

603
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:36,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintain margins they have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um and you</font>

604
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,580
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I my hypothesis here is that</font>

605
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,740
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if all this materializes if it</font>

606
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,110
hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> already vendors will be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

607
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:47,250
preserve some advantageous margins for

608
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:49,439
some customers I mean they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will but if</font>

609
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,360
what's what evolves is sort of the need

610
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,670
for sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of low margin from the vendor</font>

611
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,800
perspective interfaces because there's

612
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,660
so much demand on<font color="#CCCCCC"> done with capacities</font>

613
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">than they may need a hedge strategy</font>

614
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,400
against their<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mart a hedge against their</font>

615
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,770
margin strategies and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

616
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,900
obvious one is simplify things we've

617
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,220
been talking about that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> while and</font>

618
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:11,720
writing the ethernet costs performance

619
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:15,480
curve<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet performance up costs down</font>

620
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,740
and this leads to another thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

621
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,340
know it's like one of the things that

622
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,440
people have always talked about is um

623
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:24,840
from the vendor perspective is

624
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,580
investment protection if another way to

625
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,129
think about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is maybe you have a</font>

626
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,080
disposable network right maybe since

627
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,760
since interfaces are starting all to go

628
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,699
to ethernet and since we're talking

629
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,800
about sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of commoditized service in</font>

630
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,240
the at least in the core network maybe

631
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,010
what you want to do is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to ride</font>

632
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,800
this curve and build things that are

633
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:45,840
cheap enough to swap out on some regular

634
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,100
schedule instead of upgrading that's

635
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,199
just another way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about what</font>

636
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:55,050
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done so where to from here well</font>

637
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,850
I wish I had better slide sorry um all

638
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:58,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this is from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my perspective again</font>

639
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,510
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a scenario where you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

640
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,060
the internet that we know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> love it's</font>

641
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,710
just continues to grow<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thrive and</font>

642
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,270
this isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty deep contrast with</font>

643
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,040
the value-added transport proposition

644
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:12,240
that was ngn that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am asking all of</font>

645
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:13,350
those things and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think people need to</font>

646
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,970
note that everything is

647
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">at the top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet even though</font>

648
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,530
people sometimes like to make fine

649
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:22,320
distinctions they're not and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

650
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,059
get we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get better understanding</font>

651
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,620
of all of this in a multidisciplinary

652
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:30,299
way of evolving needs what's the

653
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,059
effective bandwidth drivers like video

654
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:34,710
and so forth um how about having access

655
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:36,990
speeds<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach the speech that we have</font>

656
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:40,679
in the core networks that's that's a big

657
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:42,780
one or two Meg's to the handset or TDM

658
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:46,350
the packet that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an that's a sore one</font>

659
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,059
with me but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like that so</font>

660
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:50,219
then this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other question people</font>

661
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:53,309
always ask me is it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's</font>

662
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:56,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">already happened it's all over there's a</font>

663
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:59,428
few opinions on that um enough you know

664
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:01,740
Eric Cecil he's a frequent poster on

665
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:04,799
this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think he's a he's at l-3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

666
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:08,039
but if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the statement he gave me</font>

667
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,950
or he wrote on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the value</font>

668
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:13,520
is talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being wiped out was the</font>

669
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:16,140
perceived high-margin packet revenue and

670
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,580
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this Fred Goldstein wrote about it</font>

671
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,549
in the book called a great telecom

672
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,020
meltdown but you know basically

673
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:24,000
basically said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the confluence of</font>

674
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:27,418
all of these three things synergize in

675
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,770
such a way that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> caused this perfect</font>

676
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:33,179
storm thing so few final thoughts we

677
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:35,490
need to educate ourselves and our

678
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:37,020
community more about that what the

679
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet is people really don't it's</font>

680
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,480
shocking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me sometimes how much people</font>

681
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:43,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really understand what it is and</font>

682
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,080
the community here includes SPS

683
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">enterprise operators content providers</font>

684
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,149
researchers<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anders users of all kinds</font>

685
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:54,658
regulators that's really important so

686
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:57,450
forth we need to encourage and encourage

687
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:59,880
means fund you know however we do it as

688
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:03,419
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a community multidisciplinary</font>

689
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,730
research in this area and you know that

690
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:07,890
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if I don't know how many</font>

691
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,169
folks have looked at these these various

692
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:12,950
issues but basically theory data and

693
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:16,169
practice are all very slim<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there</font>

694
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:18,929
finally so here's the bad outcome of all

695
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:21,360
of this um and actually I have to

696
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:23,130
tribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to Dave Clark because he</font>

697
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,918
wrote this in an email to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me up when he</font>

698
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:27,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">was looking at this stuff</font>

699
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:28,619
service providers can't be profitable

700
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:30,419
enough to continue bandwidth upgrades

701
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:33,539
that's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the bad outcome if it</font>

702
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:35,459
happens service providers then attempt

703
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:38,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">to choke off innovation for perceived</font>

704
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:40,049
self preservation of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah and</font>

705
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">they do it be a legislative or</font>

706
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:44,330
regulatory huh regulatory means or

707
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:46,139
technical means i<font color="#CCCCCC"> am asked whatever and</font>

708
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,330
we all want to avoid that<font color="#CCCCCC"> outcome</font>

709
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:50,699
because that just destroys the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

710
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:53,489
as we know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and nobody wants that so</font>

711
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,799
we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody to we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the</font>

712
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:57,839
all of the aspects of the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

714
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:04,849
together that's that how to do for time

00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:12,899
good bill<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave thanks a lot for a flat</font>

716
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:16,200
talk these are issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been thinking</font>

717
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:17,908
about a lot also and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the data</font>

718
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,820
points i got from the field was that

719
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:26,059
most Americans think they have enough

720
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:31,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">bandwidth from the broadband connection</font>

721
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:33,779
have you talked to my daughter well let

722
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:35,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">me put it to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

723
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:37,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bandwidth that you'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

724
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:47,089

727
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:57,269
or whatever I think in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your presentation</font>

728
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:59,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">though you pointed out the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for 40 bucks</font>

729
00:27:57,269 --> 00:28:01,709
a month hey that's that's probably 40

730
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:08,070
bucks us too and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's a good</font>

731
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:09,479
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question that is um you</font>

732
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:12,089
mentioned that there a<font color="#E5E5E5"> variety of</font>

733
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:13,709
technical and business and political and

734
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:16,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">so forth issues and that seems to be</font>

735
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:18,059
where the greatest quagmire potentially

736
00:28:16,499 --> 00:28:20,279
lays between you and your hundred makes

737
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:22,259
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the home where do you think these</font>

738
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:27,659
issues are most effectively going to be

739
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:30,329
discussed you know that's a really good

740
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:31,859
question the reason i framed this thing

741
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:34,918
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

742
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:37,189
deeply<font color="#CCCCCC"> multidisciplinary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

743
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,740
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that any venue that I've</font>

744
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:42,500
so far is the one that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to bring</font>

745
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:44,450
the right people together to solve these

746
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,860
problems which are deep because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

747
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,870
there are problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> their technology</font>

748
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">problems or industry problems you know</font>

749
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:53,449
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a good answer for that</font>

750
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:55,310
but I'm hoping what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hoping is</font>

751
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:58,250
that over over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next couple years we</font>

752
00:28:55,310 --> 00:29:00,139
can put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together some forums that we can</font>

753
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,760
actually discuss these issues are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

754
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:05,180
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like if you look out here</font>

755
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,650
we all understand the<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology aspects</font>

756
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,840
of it but there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very few of us who</font>

757
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,190
understand who our economist you know

758
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,230
and Jeff is a little bit maybe or

759
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,630
there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are but that's</font>

760
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:18,440
what we need so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

761
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:20,870
think Jeff Jeff Houston you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

762
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,780
go back a slide your bad outcome slide

763
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:26,229
um we're actually there you're right

764
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:29,389
there you're ready at the bad outcome

765
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:32,510
what actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens when someone</font>

766
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:35,150
attacks you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the massive</font>

767
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:37,160
incumbent because over the last hundred

768
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,740
years we've built massive telephone

769
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:42,650
company's largest industry sector on the

770
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:45,680
planet and the richest massively

771
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:48,020
overbuilt employed hundreds of thousands

772
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,750
of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this upstart industry</font>

773
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:53,960
started eating<font color="#CCCCCC"> the margin try and squash</font>

774
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:57,290
it didn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy it integrate it</font>

775
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:00,290
swallow it and then you protect your

776
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:02,480
position start playing around by making

777
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:05,060
the barrier to entry high again start

778
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,700
playing the regulatory card who owns

779
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:10,220
most of the broadband mass deployment

780
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,470
struggling independent ISPs or telco

781
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,060
money what<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually happened over the</font>

782
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:17,090
last few years was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a massive</font>

783
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:19,070
reconsolidation of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry you're</font>

784
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:22,820
now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the worst place you can</font>

785
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:25,129
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> be and realistically you're</font>

786
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,080
there you're there because we've now

787
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:29,150
eaten through most of the margins<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

788
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,310
oversupply that we built in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last 20</font>

789
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:33,440
years and you're now facing a massive

790
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:36,020
capital investment bill of no way of

791
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,620
paying it and you've gutted the industry

792
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:42,980
the margins aren't the same way anymore

793
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:45,620
so what's going to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously you</font>

794
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,890
can't turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off and obviously people</font>

795
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:50,300
want their profits and their margins

796
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,450
obviously the regulatory card is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

797
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,149
to

798
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:55,310
played by the incumbents and we're just

799
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:57,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to have to live with it so now</font>

800
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:59,750
come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you sure which way do you want</font>

801
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:02,000
to play and if you want a network that

802
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:04,430
works maybe we should resist the ng ends

803
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,170
and the imss of this world and keep on

804
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:09,370
trying to say there is a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can</font>

805
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:12,170
all enjoy this game or you can give up

806
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:14,540
but you know right now you're at a very

807
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:16,220
bad place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not going to get any</font>

808
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">better at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular point because</font>

809
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,630
most of those cards about the

810
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,390
independent<font color="#E5E5E5"> is P versus delco got played</font>

811
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:25,520
and lost they just had too much money

812
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:28,340
and now you're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this next state of</font>

813
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,889
your at the bad outcome point that's

814
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly what I'm talking about this cuz</font>

815
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,220
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think you know I don't</font>

816
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:37,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we want this you know I mean as a</font>

817
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,920
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey well as as a SP community</font>

818
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:41,360
um you're there it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a case of</font>

819
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,230
wanting it or not wanting it you know

820
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:48,590
this is 2007 this is precisely the state

821
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:51,590
you're at<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I mean I'm not arguing</font>

822
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:55,240
that point I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying my my thesis</font>

823
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:57,439
here is that we can we can find a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

824
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,840
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying I know where what it is</font>

825
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,820
because if I did I you know I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in a</font>

826
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,500
different state but I mean I I do think

827
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,360
we can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to preserve those</font>

828
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,190
properties that i was describing while

829
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,659
finding ways to be for people to be

830
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,240
profitable<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just haven't done it yet</font>

831
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:13,460
and I don't think personally I don't

832
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,620
think as far as again I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not an</font>

833
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:18,500
economist don't play one on TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> l like I</font>

834
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:21,139
stuff but in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding of what's</font>

835
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,450
out there that is a primitive discipline

836
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,710
as well with respect to the network so I

837
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:27,040
think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be</font>

838
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:33,290
done and maybe we can make some progress

839
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:35,510
Joe Joe<font color="#CCCCCC"> egli nokia um I just to respond</font>

840
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:37,899
to Jeff I think yes we are there right

841
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:39,920
now in the incumbent carriers

842
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,960
particularly in the cellular industry

843
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,770
love the scientist stuff the problem

844
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:49,360
they have is even they can't afford it

845
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:51,139
so I mean I their<font color="#E5E5E5"> build-out of new</font>

846
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:55,040
technologies that are supposed to

847
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:57,950
preserve their margin is going to run up

848
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:02,260
against their ability to finance even

849
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:02,260
the hat at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

850
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:09,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thanks i'll put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up some better</font>

851
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:10,909
format it slides for people so if they

852
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:14,110
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get them they're gonna get the</font>

853
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:14,110
PDF or something thank you
