1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,250
I guess I got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how to work</font>

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">windows now yeah that wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too hard he</font>

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:14,570
you know how hit a little button down

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,570
there that wasn't too hard to that yeah

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,470
ok so is dino pointed out this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,330
data the control plane piece of this

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,279
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a work of you know cast of</font>

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,349
thousands here same many of the same

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,519
people some some of this talk has some

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,080
redundant stuff in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going</font>

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">to skip over it the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for that was</font>

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,729
because tried to make this stand alone

13
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,920
so the stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dino already talked</font>

14
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,718
about I'll just skip over but so list

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,000
cons<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so here's what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I here's my</font>

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,739
agenda a little bit of intro a little

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,030
bit of design considerations few

18
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,300
definitions so we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> forget what you</font>

19
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,219
know just said how it works what lessons

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,419
what lessons we've learned and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully</font>

21
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,149
we'll have some time for questions and

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:56,219
comments so what list okay we don't need

23
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:57,629
that locator ID split<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I think</font>

24
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:03,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dino talked about that to let me get rid</font>

25
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:05,399
of this stuff here stand by one second

26
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I had a different kind of a</font>

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,150
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of talking about how this</font>

28
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,039
locator I see split then gets

29
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,500
engineering one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we can</font>

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,240
rewrite it if we have enough bits or we

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,070
can do you know and that was a plus 80

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,350
GS see if folks are familiar with that

33
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,798
and basically the idea was as Dina said

34
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,330
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top 64 bits as a routing locator</font>

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,810
and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom 64 bits is an</font>

36
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,119
identifier um when I wrote the slide on

37
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">gnome and made sure to tell me that Bob</font>

38
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,960
smart who I don't know when Dave Clark

39
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,640
need credit on this one too<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the map</font>

40
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,380
and in caps game was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> put another</font>

41
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">header SDNS i just put another header on</font>

42
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,280
the IP packet make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter header the</font>

43
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,860
idea in the outer hair header carry the

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,409
locators and that Lisp<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an instance of</font>

45
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and actually that's credit to</font>

46
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">hindin and daring I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where the</font>

47
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,509
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> first out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in front on that one</font>

48
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,929
get us when we don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore</font>

49
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:57,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing this one okay we</font>

50
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:01,750
also don't need this one let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

51
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:04,550
the cons<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop</font>

52
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,650
don't need this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so here are the</font>

53
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,710
terms and point identifier<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know what</font>

54
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:12,380
those are they can be p ir PA<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

55
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,290
matter routing locators usually we're

56
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,790
thinking those are out of PA space

57
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,340
ingress tunnel router<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tina talked about</font>

58
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:21,230
that and it's the device that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

59
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,870
source of the pre pencil is better also

60
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs the mapping and the egress tunnel</font>

61
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:30,110
routers the<font color="#CCCCCC"> decap router at the</font>

62
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,700
destination site so<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok here we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go so</font>

63
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,380
what we wanted to do was we wanted to be

64
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,869
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a really huge distributed</font>

65
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:39,079
mapping database service for list so

66
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,520
that so that we wouldn't have to do so

67
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,860
we wouldn't have to do static mapping

68
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,770
like we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now or data plane</font>

69
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,270
mapping and our key concern with

70
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,610
scalability because really what we did

71
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,130
not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is import all the</font>

72
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,840
scalability problems of the routing

73
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,790
system the are low grounding system if

74
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,190
you will into the mapping system and

75
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,230
every proposal that we see seems that

76
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> even some of our initial ideas seem</font>

77
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,640
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really is</font>

78
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:06,260
how to scale how to scale the amount of

79
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,619
state you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in the mapping system</font>

80
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">times the update rate and the right time</font>

81
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,760
state formulation was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's due</font>

82
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,440
to telling he was Tony Lee was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

83
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,019
person who formulated that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way of</font>

84
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway if both of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

85
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:21,769
are large we're obviously going to be in

86
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,209
trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we think the state is going</font>

87
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:25,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be something like order of 10 to 10</font>

88
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,750
so that's sort of me<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 into 10 so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

89
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,120
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to aggregate</font>

90
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:33,860
the Eid s into eid prefixes to reduce

91
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,140
state rate also has to be small and so

92
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,430
what we what we've tried to do or the

93
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,290
way we've kind of spec this is that

94
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,090
mappings and we'll see where those

95
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,200
reside in a second but they have what

96
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,600
we're calling subscription time

97
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,880
frequency of change which means they

98
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:52,100
don't change<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot low frequency and</font>

99
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,609
this is key there's no reach ability

100
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,720
information in the mapping database

101
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,280
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do that by the way if you</font>

102
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,350
do that you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> built another routing</font>

103
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,519
protocol and then all the problems that

104
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,049
we have with the routing protocol

105
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,780
getting imported here so we've been

106
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:07,730
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to avoid that so what kind of</font>

107
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,700
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we need to answer here well</font>

108
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,380
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the mappings that seems</font>

109
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,030
obvious where to do that how to find

110
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">them that seems obvious</font>

111
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,410
problem then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dino mention this are we</font>

112
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,358
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push all of the mappings to the</font>

113
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,250
edges were to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITRs who need them</font>

114
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:25,460
that seems unlikely if it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 to the 10</font>

115
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,139
or something like that is it pull well

116
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,580
that has its other it has its other

117
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:30,950
issues as well and we'll talk about that

118
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">does it need secondary storage do we are</font>

119
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,450
we going to use caching all of the

120
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:36,710
standard tools this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a this is</font>

121
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">a big one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about security</font>

122
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,450
considerations come and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

123
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">about protecting the new infrastructure</font>

124
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,200
that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put up from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> das and</font>

125
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,000
so we know all about this now and how

126
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,550
about controlling packet loss and look

127
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,690
up latency so all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things come</font>

128
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:55,520
into play when we're trying to design

129
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:57,200
this this is the problem if you push it

130
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,180
out it doesn't scale because of the

131
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,700
database is big caching doesn't really

132
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,650
scale so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had to pick one so at list</font>

133
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:07,310
of cons refer is going to reflect our

134
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:10,219
hybrid approach to this so what we do is

135
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,750
we push eid prefixes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is crucial</font>

136
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,580
so when I show you how this<font color="#CCCCCC"> works just</font>

137
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,100
keep this in mind we're pushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pre</font>

138
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,560
eid prefixes around at the upper levels

139
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,810
but explicitly not the actual mappings

140
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,040
themselves so we have a hierarchical

141
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,200
thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you in a second but</font>

142
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,300
at the upper level of this there's only

143
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">a ID prefixes around up there no</font>

144
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,169
mappings and then you pull the mappings

145
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,789
out of the lower level of the

146
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:33,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">hierarchies and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how we</font>

147
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:35,060
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we cannot we can get good scaling</font>

148
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,340
properties and you'll see in a second

149
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,110
how that works and basically the

150
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,909
mappings are stored at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lower levels</font>

151
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,950
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this hierarchy and requests through</font>

152
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:44,150
this thing it Matt get routed to where

153
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:47,300
the mappings actually reside

154
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:50,179
authoritative<font color="#CCCCCC"> lee and then replies get</font>

155
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,380
returned on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverse path so this is</font>

156
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,910
crucial point we'll see we'll see

157
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:58,570
exactly how this all works in a second

158
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,570
so and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the low I</font>

159
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:06,410
see here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this list three other</font>

160
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,150
thing is old kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of terminology because</font>

161
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,950
we had these various grades of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lisp and</font>

162
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,989
this one was called 30 but that's not

163
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:14,830
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I want to show you how it</font>

164
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">works we think we can get good EIG</font>

165
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,400
aggregation if the hierarchy is based on

166
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,900
e eid prefix allocation and not on

167
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,900
topology and this is the whole key to

168
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">this locator ID split right that the</font>

169
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,620
reason we can't the reason we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

170
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:30,710
lot of cases we can't get

171
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:33,520
good aggregation is because IP addresses

172
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">today are allocated along perhaps</font>

173
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,979
organizational boundaries not

174
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:40,698
topological boundaries and we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

175
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:45,320
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IDS to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allocated along</font>

00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:47,150
a more easily aggregate able to apology

177
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,699
which isn't doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be congruent</font>

178
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,198
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the physical topology and so then</font>

179
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:53,600
so what we do is we build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a logical</font>

180
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,780
topology based on these e<font color="#E5E5E5"> I d prefix</font>

181
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,470
allocations and the map requests that

182
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:02,929
the debt<font color="#CCCCCC"> I TRS generator routed through</font>

183
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:05,419
this logical hierarchy based on the ID

184
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,510
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> map reply just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets returned the</font>

185
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:12,080
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> way so and what it gets is the eid</font>

186
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:14,419

187
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,229
have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> elements continuing</font>

188
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:20,599
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lisp and cons theme here we</font>

189
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:24,260
have content access routers which are

190
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:27,680
they are querying so you might query on

191
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,840
B hops on behalf of an ITR and you

192
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,419
return answers tonight and to an ITR and

193
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,510
you have answering which hold<font color="#CCCCCC"> authority</font>

194
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:38,000
authoritative mappings and aggregate Eid

195
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:39,200
prefixes upwards and they respond with

196
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,750
map replies of course because they're

197
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,039
authoritative and then we have content

198
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,440
distribution routers at the higher

199
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,510
levels of the of the hierarchy and they

200
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,210
push around the prefixes from the lower

201
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,919
level but again not the mappings and

202
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,510
they can aggregate upwards giving us

203
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,190
more aggregated bility so we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

204
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,349
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a hierarchy and build it</font>

205
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:03,320
right we can get really nice aggregation

206
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:07,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eid prefect space and um get get on</font>

207
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:09,110
a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good rate time state as well oh</font>

208
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,400
and they don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be routers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tina</font>

209
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,660
says yeah that's an important point they

210
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,690
don't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be routers</font>

211
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:18,080
because they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the data plane so</font>

212
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:19,250
and then what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they do at the</font>

213
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">higher level is we forward the map</font>

214
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,470
replies and requests and we'll see how

215
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:26,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> works in a second so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> picture</font>

216
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:29,300
um I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to show you guys what</font>

217
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,460
we're trying to do here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so let's see</font>

218
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">will the pointer work here so here's an</font>

219
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,390
ETR here's an answering car which

220
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,929
answers authoritative<font color="#CCCCCC"> lee on behalf of</font>

221
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:40,729
whatever mapping the ETR has and what

222
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,179
happens what we do is we pair up these

223
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,060
things

224
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:46,069
these different network elements amongst

225
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:48,469
one another like this and the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

226
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,630
is that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these pairings have h mac</font>

227
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,810
protected connections so that we don't

228
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:57,470
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that anybody can inject any any</font>

229
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:59,239
bogus data in sight once once we're

230
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:02,209
inside the mesh so that's kind of our

231
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,600
one of our kind of assumptions that

232
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:07,329
there's a transitive trust thing huh

233
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:11,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the child and</font>

234
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:14,360
then what happens is that the answering

235
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,640
car will aggregate will will push the

236
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,620
aggregated eid prefix upwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

237
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,529
now here's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is our</font>

238
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,770
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of a this is kind of our</font>

239
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:26,990
canonical example so there's a bunch of

240
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,220
what these are work out what we're

241
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,200
calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> coders up here and there in a</font>

242
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,120
mesh and then there's a second-level

243
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,890
mesh down here because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do this to</font>

244
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">get better aggregation and then all of</font>

245
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,209
the answering<font color="#E5E5E5"> and querying cars are down</font>

246
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,709
here so what I want to do is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

247
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:41,959
one example so you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how this</font>

248
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:43,969
works it's pretty straightforward so

249
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:46,579
what happens is this ETR has a mapping

250
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:49,790
assigned to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in this case it has</font>

251
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:53,839
the Eid 1 10 / 24 and it has two

252
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:56,510
locators l1 and l2 and this one has l11

253
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,330
and l1 and l2<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

254
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:00,470
happen here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it well here let's</font>

255
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,300
give a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little history what we used to</font>

256
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,820
think was that we should have a register

257
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,500
message between the EGR and the a car

258
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:08,360
but we figured after a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

259
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,230
experiment a little bit of thinking

260
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this you're gonna have to</font>

261
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,640
configure that anyway so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we decided that</font>

262
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we do is just configure it for the</font>

263
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,209
time being in the a car so this this is

264
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">showing that EGR ET de TRS at the bottom</font>

265
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:23,540
have these mappings and then they

266
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,910
communicate those to the a car probably

267
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,219
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time there that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there the</font>

268
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:32,779
subscription is happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what</font>

269
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:37,339
happens is um the a car will push the

270
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:38,750
push the Eid prefix upward like this so

271
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can see this</font>

272
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:42,770
um be nice if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had a pointer do we</font>

273
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:47,570
have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you keep moving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it around it</font>

274
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:49,850
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> appears</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right here we</font>

275
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:52,670
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one okay so um so we're</font>

276
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:54,560
pushing their<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CID prefix 1100 16</font>

277
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,810
upwards right that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ACARS</font>

278
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,449
and so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> critter at the first level</font>

279
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,739
sees it it pushes it aggregates<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

280
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,350
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can aggregate these two</font>

281
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,980
together now so it pushes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> / 8 upwards</font>

282
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:09,440
and then over here now when this ITR is

283
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,839
making a query what it'll do is it'll

284
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,930
send a map request for this the map

285
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,150
request gets the querying car says<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

286
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:21,589
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no mapping found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to its</font>

287
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:23,240
parent noe noe ID prefix here by the way

288
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:26,870
this is following<font color="#E5E5E5"> defaults that's how we</font>

289
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,980
make this happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright okay so that's</font>

290
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,480
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good point so if it happened to be</font>

291
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,620
cached they're not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this example but</font>

292
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,410
it would happen be cash there could

293
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:36,200
return it right away right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so now</font>

294
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:38,300
the map request is going upwards and it

295
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,570
takes the shortest path because it sees

296
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,670
the / 8 here it goes across this thing

297
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:45,350
the request goes down you'll finally get

298
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,569
to the answering car here where the more

299
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:54,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">specific is and it'll send a reply back</font>

300
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:57,170
oops so that's kind of a crowded picture

301
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,780
but if you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it basically</font>

302
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,520
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aunt the answering cars pushes the</font>

303
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,920
prefix upward bills this sort of

304
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,630
forwarding environment that it needs

305
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,729
when the request comes through it

306
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:10,460
follows that forwarding requirement

307
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:13,190
highly aggregated all the way down to

308
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">the a car that that originally pushed it</font>

309
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,480
because it was authoritative and then

310
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:23,630
that a car returns<font color="#E5E5E5"> map request or a map</font>

311
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:26,030
reply<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now yeah going so what</font>

312
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:28,700
we were thinking is that at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> level 0</font>

313
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:30,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be on the order of 10,000 boxes and</font>

314
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,339
then at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next level going up it would</font>

315
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:36,560
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe hundreds of boxes and at the</font>

316
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:39,080
very top it could be either registries

317
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,119
or tier 1 ISPs in the tens so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

318
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,860
we would order as a magnitude with scale

319
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,459
as we fan out across this large

320
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:48,140
hierarchy so that's I mean we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

321
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:49,400
that for sure but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the sort of</font>

322
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,260
input we like to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the you guys</font>

323
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,770
so that's briefly you can see how this

324
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:58,610
works it's a pretty simple request reply

325
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:59,810
protocol so we've learned a lot of stuff

326
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,870
already and we haven't even done the

327
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,640
implementation yet so the first thing

328
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,170
we've learned is what we really what we

329
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,610
really wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do was optimized the</font>

330
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:10,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">aggregator bility of the</font>

331
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,170
eid prefixes because we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn</font>

332
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:14,810
the lessons of the routing system and

333
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,849
take advantage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our opportunity to</font>

334
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:21,229
do a better job of aligning this new

335
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:23,209
topology with the assignment topology so

336
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,820
that led to the design that you just saw

337
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:27,199
wear eid prefixes were pushed around at

338
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,570
the higher levels of the things but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

339
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,370
the mappings themselves so that had that

340
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,290
had an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue right well let me just say</font>

341
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:36,790
this is we did all this because we were

342
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,790
concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the rate state product</font>

343
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:42,620
but in talking to other people other

344
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,839
service providers of various kinds

345
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,519
another dimension of all this thing all

346
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,339
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was articulated now is latency</font>

347
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:50,870
and you could see it well I wish I had

348
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:52,100
the other picture somewhere here but you

349
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,450
could see that there's a certain amount

350
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">of latency that's going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> involved</font>

351
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,200
in having a request go all the way up

352
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:01,519
and down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and back so you have to trade</font>

353
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:04,100
off rate state and latency and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

354
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,079
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find is that if you do a push</font>

355
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,970
model you wind up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole the</font>

356
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,649
whole database in network elements all

357
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,899
over the place and that that blows away

358
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:13,640
the state if the state if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out</font>

359
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:16,579
that the database is as big as we think

360
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:19,069
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be on the other hand if you</font>

361
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:21,109
pull exclusively like we were just

362
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:25,940
describing well then you incur some

363
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:27,709
latency if you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do mobility and</font>

364
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,630
put reach ability into the database then

365
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:31,760
you get perhaps lots of updates and then

366
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,959
you've blown away to rate so these

367
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,459
things are these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are kind of</font>

368
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,290
working against each other and so we

369
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:38,899
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little bit crafty in what</font>

370
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:40,219
we do here so one of the things that

371
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:42,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> currently thinking is that a</font>

372
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:45,829
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of hybrid approach might</font>

373
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:47,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">be of interest something like now these</font>

374
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:49,310
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ideas right so something like</font>

375
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,579
push the whole mapping table around<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

376
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:55,160
the highest level and then let the<font color="#CCCCCC"> itrs</font>

377
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:58,670
pull the mappings from the car or maybe

378
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:00,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want level one could or meshes that</font>

379
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,579
has a few nice properties from my

380
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,440
perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway you can get the whole</font>

381
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:05,839
mapping table if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to see in the</font>

382
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,730
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current constant spec you can't</font>

383
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">really get there's no way to get the</font>

384
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,350
whole table really conveniently if you

385
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so if you happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to want it for</font>

386
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,890
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason you happen to want</font>

387
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,899
latency gets reduced because you don't

388
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to traverse this whole hierarchy up</font>

389
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:20,480
and down to get the mapping so that's

390
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,430
nice

391
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,860
oh ok and that's about all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have and</font>

392
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:27,620
then I think you know you publish this

393
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:31,339
for right yeah so some off by one so

394
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:33,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dino has a / 04 and condos on 02 right</font>

395
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:39,440
now so I now might be a good time to

396
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:44,120
take questions I'm Christian folk from

397
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">erickson if I was a site operator I</font>

398
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:51,949
would want to be make sure that I'm the

399
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:54,310
last one deploying Lisbon because if I

400
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:57,620
deployed<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lisp as an early adopter and</font>

401
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:59,119
notes in other networks that have not

402
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,329
yet deployed list wouldn't be able to

403
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">reach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me any longer and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason to</font>

404
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:08,569
this is very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lisp users or makes</font>

405
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:13,130
host use route IP addresses that are not

406
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:15,139
routable so the whole technique only

407
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,779
works if there are border routers on

408
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:20,600
both sides of a communication session

409
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:23,449
and if one isn't there the communication

410
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,819
won't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a host won't be able to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm not a way of a good</font>

415
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:40,160
solution for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I could take that</font>

416
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:42,829
question um so it's not true ellipse I

417
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,010
cannot can talk to an analyst site it

418
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:47,989
all depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on if the IP addresses are</font>

419
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,060
injected<font color="#CCCCCC"> into routing or not starting</font>

420
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,850
off people will probably deploy Lisp and

421
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:59,119
not pull their routes out<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that</font>

422
00:16:52,850 --> 00:17:00,889
that's that's the first thing and but

423
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,680
they know you know like one but let me

424
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:10,280
just say wanna<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all of these schemes</font>

425
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:11,418
um that there's transition issues with

426
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,799
all of these schemes let me just put

427
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:15,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the one that you pointed out</font>

428
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,209
has some merit you know and we're all

429
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,130
working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it trying to figure out how</font>

430
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,770
to how to ease<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know and and</font>

431
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:24,020
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a good point well taken yeah</font>

432
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">it really I know you I know you're</font>

433
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,980
working on it and I'm just saying it and

434
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,899
basically Dino<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point that you</font>

435
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,990
brought up that you could leave the

436
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,590
routes and in the in the in the network

437
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,789
on the

438
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:40,850
the in the in the routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> um if you did</font>

439
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:42,980
that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go continue using</font>

440
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:46,760
the provider independent addressing

441
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:48,320
model that multi on sites use today is

442
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,700
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you're absolutely right</font>

443
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,850
but this was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just solving one</font>

444
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,620
problem you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but all the</font>

445
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,719
routing table reduction problem is is

446
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,489
the problem and if you can't get routing

447
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,830
table reduction that you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

448
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,350
solution yes you still get a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

449
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:06,168
other benefits<font color="#E5E5E5"> but all of these benefits</font>

450
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,789
are actually you get all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

451
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,500
benefits if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use the provider</font>

452
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:11,690
independent addressing model that that

453
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,340
that we are seeing today but the

454
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,169
disadvantages<font color="#E5E5E5"> at across provide an</font>

455
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,899
independent of that provider independent

456
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:20,210
editing model is that it has scalability

457
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:21,979
issues so in order to solve the

458
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,990
scalability issues you would get have

459
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,049
have to get rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these additional</font>

460
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:29,480
routes in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet core it's what</font>

461
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:31,970
weekend so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't I don't think it's a</font>

462
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">solution to leave the routes there so so</font>

463
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,480
certainly you know I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we've</font>

464
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,699
we've thought about so far is that we've

465
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:41,240
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of three generic ways to think</font>

466
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:43,940
about transition and using routable eid

467
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,320
space is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those ways and as the</font>

468
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">sum of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the negatives that you've talked</font>

469
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,860
about about it doesn't immediately start

470
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,840
reducing table size table size keeps

471
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:55,039
growing if everybody keeps it into two

472
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:57,049
places um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also want to amplify</font>

473
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,440
dino's point though is that list<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

474
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:03,590
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunities for other for other</font>

475
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,590
benefits like being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do active</font>

476
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:10,129
active backup active active utilization

477
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:13,090
of links and some other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nice</font>

478
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:15,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">security properties as well but the</font>

479
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,590
other two transition mechanisms I think

480
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,779
deserve a brief mention here and those

481
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:23,209
those in addition to rattle bloody ID

482
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:27,590
space include doing some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a proxy</font>

483
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:30,440
tunnel router right to allow non with

484
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:32,750
sites to get to list sites right<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to</font>

485
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">achieve that mapping and doing some sort</font>

486
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:39,260
of source that scheme so we're really

487
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:41,539
just looking at those now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

488
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,830
something here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a point of order for</font>

489
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:45,890
those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you who haven't been following</font>

490
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,120
this and it's what's been happening the

491
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,880
ATF<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how this</font>

492
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,600
came about let's keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind that liz</font>

493
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,720
is truly an experimental exercise right

494
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,790
now to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see if this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of technology</font>

495
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,809
can work it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to test and</font>

496
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:03,740
see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this can be incrementally</font>

497
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:07,040
deployed can we truly separate locator

498
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,600
and ID and is it is viable to do so this

499
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,090
isn't intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> to replace the existing</font>

500
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,370
writing protocols tomorrow this is truly

501
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,959
experimental<font color="#E5E5E5"> no and I'm not trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

502
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:17,179
shoot anybody down and just I'm just

503
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,929
bringing up my point you and basically

504
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm still I'm still saying it the the

505
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:26,090
advantages that you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would get</font>

506
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,160
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would remain if you would leave</font>

507
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,980
the existing rails in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet core</font>

508
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,410
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be exactly the things that you can</font>

509
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:38,000
already do today by using provided

510
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:41,720
independent addressing you're absolutely

511
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">right they're not you but you it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

512
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,800
not that simple I mean there's going to

513
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,150
be a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a water</font>

514
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,190
balloon you squeeze one end it's going

515
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way and then you know we're</font>

516
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,260
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to have we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

517
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some inefficiencies which</font>

518
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,800
are the inefficiencies we bear today

519
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,120
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not adding any new ones and we're</font>

520
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have to live with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that until a</font>

521
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,899
time where we can be more efficient I

522
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,090
mean that's going to be the pain of

523
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,470
transition there there's not going to be

524
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,629
any magic bullet here<font color="#CCCCCC"> or we would have</font>

525
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:10,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">done it a long time ago so I'm point of</font>

526
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,450
order i got from Ted we got to move the

Christian<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to say one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

529
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:18,710
that with respect to transition

530
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,179
strategies and you know bulletproof

531
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:23,630
transition mechanisms we don't even have

532
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:25,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for ipv6 right now so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font>

533
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:32,750
a tough problem is what I'm trying to

534
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:35,300
say yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> yadda yadda so first off as a</font>

535
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,280
old<font color="#E5E5E5"> least programming language hacker I</font>

536
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,080
really like your naming of the various

537
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,520
components in this we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

538
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:45,800
it we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find an acronym for</font>

539
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:47,780
scheme next<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I really came here</font>

540
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:52,870
to ask about or make a comment about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

541
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:55,700
mobility stuff and basically I would

542
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:57,860
suggest that it probably makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

543
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,620
you to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what type of mobility</font>

544
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:02,490
to address

545
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:06,149
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems that least in its nature as</font>

546
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:08,970
something exits in routers and doesn't

547
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:10,980
require host changes is easiest

548
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">applicable to this sort of a mobile</font>

549
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:17,130
router kind of case<font color="#CCCCCC"> where as if he I'm</font>

550
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,959
you know I could route on a train or

551
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,930
something like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

552
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,790
apply it on for host moving from you

553
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:28,680
know this network<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the hotel network</font>

554
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:30,540
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have another set of issues and those</font>

555
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:34,350
issues probably can be sold but I'm not

556
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:38,690
sure you can simultaneously keep things

557
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:40,709
secure and not have any host changes so

558
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:45,059
yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something for you to think</font>

559
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:48,300
about well well taken thank you I guess

560
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:51,178
we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> state our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> names Kevin over in</font>

562
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:56,760
up there on the panel there who have

563
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,490
some familiarity with with routers does

564
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,890
it look like this capability can be

565
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:04,110
readily implemented in existing asics

566
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,660
with just code updates are we going to

567
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,370
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not only allow time for this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

568
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:12,210
be tested confirm that it really works

569
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:13,379
of course software written and asics but

570
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,150
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could be put into production</font>

571
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,240
because if it does that pushes it down

572
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:20,030
the road a very very long way and my

573
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,350
fibs not going to live that long

574
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:25,110
excellent comment we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to be</font>

575
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,129
practical we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you may</font>

576
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,479
not believe me<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm a router</font>

577
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,550
vendor but we're not trying to force

578
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,679
people to buy new gear to make this

579
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:35,970
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay maybe my marketing people to</font>

580
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,950
shoot me now but I really believe I mean

581
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,360
I've looked at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've worked on a lot</font>

582
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,400
of hardware platforms I've looked at

583
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,800
this in the ITR there's absolutely no

584
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,300
hardware changes I believe in the ETR is

585
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,159
a little bit different because you have

586
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,928
to know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decap if we use a</font>

587
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,400
control plane model in the in the pet

588
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:51,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">the locators always address to the</font>

589
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,750
router then it's with existing

590
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:56,850
mechanisms we have today ipsec GRE or

591
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:58,200
whatever the locator reach ability

592
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,419
information that's in the control plane

593
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,580
is interesting as well but you can leak

594
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,530
signals to the control plane to be able

595
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,360
to give you located reach ability if you

596
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:09,450
really are worried<font color="#E5E5E5"> about protecting your</font>

597
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,340
control plane at millisecond granularity

598
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,170
that's going to be the convergence times

599
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,669
of your locator switch over so you have

600
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,980
to play that trade-off game right there

601
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:20,730
but we're trying whatever we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can not to</font>

602
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:22,860
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> asics we it were torn between</font>

603

00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:34,110
change or does it not<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so very well</font>

608
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,240
aware great comment just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick comment</font>

609
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,979
that clearly the module that does the

maintenance of the cash that edits the

611
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,770

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fits into the letters emacs oh nice</font>

615
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,928
an it oh my i know that you only had a

616
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,990
short period of time he<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to gloss</font>

617
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:59,700
over almost all the details but one of

618
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,350
the details<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Dino glossed over I</font>

619
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,450
want to take a little bit of exception

620
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:05,760
to which is you were saying oh you know

621
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:07,830
don't worry about dropping packets on a

622
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,060
cache miss when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and fetch stuff</font>

623
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:11,159
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only going to happen at the</font>

624
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:13,560
beginning of a conversation and it's

625
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,270
also going to happen at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least when if</font>

626
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a I tiara failure you have to</font>

fail over to another one<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's a</font>

628
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit grim because then you have</font>

629
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:23,190
the equivalent of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know starting a</font>

same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in your latter case that</font>

632
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,760
doesn't have to be true because if

633
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,610
you're doing active active there's a

634
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,590
good chance that both<font color="#CCCCCC"> itrs have the</font>

635
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,060
mapping and if you wanted to add an

636
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:38,010
additional mechanism to sync up the

637
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,659
mapping tables between the two itrs you

638
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:42,179
could do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

639
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,919
solvable problem i think in the second

00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:46,140
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think this is just sort of</font>

641
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,640
mirroring what<font color="#E5E5E5"> christian said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i</font>

may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be your first slide dino you said</font>

00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,750
stuff be euchromatic a deployable and

645
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,129
there'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a transition plan and i would</font>

like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to encourage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys next time you</font>

do this you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> roadshow to talk about</font>

648
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,700
the transition plan more and the packet

649
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:04,710
diagrams less because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I agree with you</font>

650
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,940
that's the single most important thing

651
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:10,500
and it really hasn't been covered yet

652
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,240
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree all right we're going</font>

653
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to close the queue after these two and</font>

Rahul if you're in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> you please</font>

655
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:19,470
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the stage no Jake Coon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> volkan</font>

656
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:21,630
I know this is kind of in its infancy

657
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:25,890
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> my notice is all done you know</font>

658
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:27,630
sort of just I wouldn't I wouldn't call

659
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:31,370
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> get e cody but I've just you know</font>

660
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:34,770
quick coding and but have you guys

661
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:37,550
gotten any performance results in your

662
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:40,590
testing so far as to how fast you can

663
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:44,280
transfer the mapping tables between the

664
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:48,629
CD RS and are there ways to improve that

665
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:51,170
and would current mechanisms in place

666
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:58,740

667
00:26:51,170 --> 00:27:01,800
for optimization be useful so um thanks

668
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the question um we so I guess we</font>

669
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:08,070
don't have a constant plement ation

670
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:09,360
number one number two be so that's

671
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,389
something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just getting going so</font>

672
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,889
we wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have data on that yet the</font>

673
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,270
second thing is is that we've worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

674
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:16,830
you know we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortunate enough to</font>

675
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,110
have null working on this with us and

676
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,520
null has such an incredible tool bag of

677
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:23,610
optimizations we don't know which ones

678
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,980
to pick yet so when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

679
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,570
that study which it will um there's a

680
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,510
lot of there's a big bag of there's a

681
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:31,800
big tool bag of tools to work on that if

682
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,530
we get / if we don't like the

683
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:39,120
performance we see so that's that's

684
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:42,090
forthcoming Oh Dino has 10 Jake Dino has

685
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,679
one other<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow</font>

686
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:46,800
that up with a deadline we probably can

687
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:51,240
report on something at March<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF thank</font>

you hi Lars<font color="#CCCCCC"> egerton work for now can</font>

ITF I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one some of</font>

691
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,710
Dino's earlier slides I talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

692
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:00,720
data plane there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> some options in</font>

693
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,850
there that would either drop packets or

694
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,340
maybe route packets a different way and

695
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,409
I would urge<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to look at if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

696
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:10,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">not doing this already look at how your</font>

697
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:12,540
eject up IP plane looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> two transports</font>

698
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,040
and applications because we have

699
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">experience in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the past with mobile IP</font>

700
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,399
for example which looks great on paper

701
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,439
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start to run TCP</font>

702
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,330
connections over it in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> figured during</font>

703
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,340
a handover it really starts<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

704
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,050
saccharide so so these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

705
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,139
you want to avoid for the list data

706
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:29,550
plane so so start talking to transport

707
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,860
people there's other questions like how

00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:33,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">does interact with sctp which has its</font>

709
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,399
own host-based<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming at a</font>

710
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,730
transport layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have no idea if this</font>

711
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,350
works

712
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,300
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDS or not but these are</font>

713
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,379
questions that are important when you

714
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,870
start thinking about how applications

715
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,300
will react to Liz being sort of put

716
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,939
underneath them right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

717
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,350
question on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> first question if you</font>

718
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,540
had to make the trade off between

719
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:54,600
dropping packets and doing triangle and

720
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:57,420
higher latency packet paths which one

721
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,189
would you choose I don't know but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

722
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,930
not proposing list right so everybody's

723
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,400
done both and nobody likes<font color="#E5E5E5"> either one</font>

724
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:04,140
and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no where there's no third</font>

725
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,640
possibility unless somebody could stand

726
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:09,330
up in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> room and talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a third</font>

727
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,610
possibility so I I think mobile IP is a

728
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,139
hard thing to solve and I don't think

729
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:14,760
there's any magic bullet list that's

730
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,410
going to make it better<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

731
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,940
can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I'm just making a statement</font>

732
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:19,560
and I'm not being defensive to what

733
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,600
you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> I quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree what you're</font>

734
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,310
saying we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to make lists work</font>

735
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,409
in that environment sort of mobile IP is

736
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:27,149
running underneath it or mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6 is</font>

737
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,680
running underneath it abutilon only

738
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,300
using mobile IP as an example of

739
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,470
something where people had an idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

740
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,149
thought it would work out well and then

741
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,530
we're unintended consequences<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

742
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,570
could be a similar example with the

743
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:40,170
intentions are great right I agree with

744
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:41,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">them but the if the data plane ends up</font>

745
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:45,510
looking to applications or transfer

746
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:47,580
protocols enough different than what

747
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:49,320
what the IP data plan currently looks

748
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,030
like because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it drops a few packets here</font>

749
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,770
and it reroutes a few packets there if

750
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,690
application performance suffers right

751
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:56,610
what's the trade-off do we are we

752
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,200
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of sacrifice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

753
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,090
application performance for an improved

754
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,590
routing system I don't know it's an open

755
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,540
question but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an important one okay</font>

756
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:06,179
because in the end the users shouldn't

757
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:08,220
be affected by this so let me leave

758
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:10,290
mobile IP aside but let's just talk

759
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the applications be affected by</font>

760
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:14,010
this jack up is basically with the

761
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,240
questionnaires and we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

762
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:17,250
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of packets that are running over</font>

763
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,620
tunnels today there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of transit</font>

764
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:21,750
eyes peas are running mpls today so we

765
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,580
know what the properties are these

766
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,200
properties are not that much different

767
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,090
these aren't these are tunnels

768
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,900
necessarily they're being pulled up and

769
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:33,030
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> on demand this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is I mean</font>

770
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically there's this is no different</font>

771
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:36,930
than a six to four tunnel behavior it

772
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:38,910
should look just like a 64 tunnel

773
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:40,980
behavior all right guys what okay I

774
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:43,020
would suggest that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take this</font>

775
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:44,480
offline in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hallway and finish this</font>

776
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,960
discussion

777
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,850
just less comment and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are done</font>

778
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:52,560
larse one of the things that um I've

779
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:56,100
felt and I think all of the list crew

780
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:58,139
feels so important about is so important

781
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,879
about getting implement you know pre

782
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:03,300
standard implementations into the field

783
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:06,030
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for this issue you know running</font>

784
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:11,520
code not rough paper or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

785
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:15,860
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> or ATM</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks guys appreciate</font>

786
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">it very much good stuff</font>
