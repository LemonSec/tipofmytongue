00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,680
alright so<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those of you who were in</font>

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bellevue we had a pretty interesting</font>

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,940
panel on 40 gig and 100 gig and some of

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,639
the work went on there in the standards

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,670
bodies and I thought it would be a good

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:18,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">follow-on to continue with another panel</font>

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,939
talking about some of the optical

8
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,650
developments going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> in research work</font>

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,070
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that world in that in that space if</font>

10
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:29,310
you will and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you may not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it</font>

11
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,260
but Drew's<font color="#CCCCCC"> company do a perkins for</font>

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,719
infant area here they started working on

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">their stuff quite a long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time ago right</font>

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,780
about the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom fell out of</font>

15
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,030
the industry if i'm not mistaken and

16
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">they actually made it through and they</font>

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,170
got their box to market and they're

18
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing quite well what's kind of cool</font>

19
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,550
about that is there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of work</font>

20
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,890
going on in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the optical space</font>

21
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,959
prior to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and when the bottom fell</font>

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,329
out all that cool work going on stop

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,460
happening and now things are slowly

24
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,770
starting to pick back up and some of

25
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,559
that works starting to get engaged<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

26
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,609
and come to fruition for so hopefully

27
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll see some more cool stuff coming</font>

28
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">down the pike here soon why it's</font>

29
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,430
important in the internet space in the

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,229
IP space is it gives us some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

31
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">new tools and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to move more bits</font>

32
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,280
more efficiently better spectral

33
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,220
efficiency if you will some people like

34
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">that term better throughput better reach</font>

35
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,570
all these new things going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on so I had</font>

36
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kimball the idea to put together a panel</font>

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,490
to kind of talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

38
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,259
things and this is that panel and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

this panel there's some good stuff going

57
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,560
to be talked about

58
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to ask that you save your</font>

questions till the end I do not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,200
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> us get rat hole between</font>

61
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,670
presentations and burn 20 minutes and

62
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">then shortchange some of the other</font>

63
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,970
speakers so if you all<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be kind</font>

64
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,730
enough to do that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome</font>

morning everybody Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Ted I've got</font>

68
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,130
the more slides here than I should so

69
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,049
I'm going to be going<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty quick</font>

70
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,280
through them here just a bit more on my

00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,190
background I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in the</font>

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,900
internet since the very early 80s

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,990
actually was one of the first people

that the very first IETF actually and

75
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:02,530
I've had a long background in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as optical technology but spent</font>

perspective on what's what's going on

00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:15,040
here the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> generation of optical</font>

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,000
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an agenda slide we talk about</font>

lame the services bonding multiple

channels together 10 gige under Giggy

87
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,220
and where we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it needs to be going</font>

88
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,750
as quickly as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible terribly ethernet</font>

89
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:35,620
we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some work we're doing on</font>

92
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,450
modulation approaches and then talk a

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,070
little bit about photonic integration

94
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,420
and unfortunately we're not gonna be

95
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:46,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to cover any of these things in</font>

do is we're scaling an IP network from

for a range of one to two hundred six

126
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,920
up I'll say more about that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet</font>

127
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,320
the future of optical transport really

128
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,820
appears to be Ethernet basis by far the

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,290
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost-effective thing it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

no-brainer mother<font color="#CCCCCC"> heading up apple pie</font>

131
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:13,500
I'm sure so just sort of definition what

132
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:16,370
we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there we go IP links you know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a decade ago yes</font>

135
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,160
means you had a lambda<font color="#E5E5E5"> a wavelength</font>

136
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,169
running across your transport network

137
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,320
and then you carved it up into TDM time

145
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">emerged and first we start using two and</font>

146
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,380
half gig wavelengths then we stepped up

147
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,330
to 10 then you know earlier this decade

148
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:56,310
we started to need more than a wave life

149
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,760
and you start having started having to

150
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,770
bond circuits together between a core

151
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,200
adjacent corn oats and your IP network

152
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:07,919
we call that super lambda we're using

153
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,300
multiple lambdas to to aggregate a<font color="#E5E5E5"> leg</font>

156
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,340
there's a bunch of terms for it

157
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:17,130
basically inverse multiplexing of your

158

162
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,620
look at where where traffic's going and

2010 and other carriers have made

206

it's no getting around that so as I said

226
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,680
we're doing the study trying to look at

227

00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,910
the baseline<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and as you do that</font>

if you're spending most your router on

so it becomes increasingly inefficient

270
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:41,580
so what happens when you start adding

cost-effectiveness there's a few places

283
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:09,488
that there's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> high demands going</font>

284
00:11:06,849 --> 00:11:11,199
between but but not all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> many so</font>

285
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:14,439
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been studying this and seeing okay</font>

286
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:16,508
well if that's true<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does that scale</font>

287
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:18,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">as the network scales as we get out to</font>

288
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:21,369
2010 and beyond and we start getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

289
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:23,498
terabit links what opportunities start

290
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:26,109
presenting themselves to putting in IP

291
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:27,609
router bypass links to shunt traffic

292
00:11:26,109 --> 00:11:30,249
directly across transport nodes and

293
00:11:27,609 --> 00:11:31,859
bypass intermediate IP routers and what

294
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:35,199
kind of cost savings does that get you

295
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:37,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so here you see a picture a graph</font>

296
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:39,069
here and these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhat preliminary</font>

00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:46,089
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> on on target what we see is</font>

299
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:48,939
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability to add in IP router</font>

300
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:50,139
bypass links increases over time as you

301
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:54,159
scale your network higher and higher and

302
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:56,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">higher so what you see on the left for</font>

306
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:07,419
off on the left side I'm sorry but this

307
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:09,339
is sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of one hundred percent is what</font>

308
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:11,199
the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with no router bypass</font>

309
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:13,029
at all and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go down</font>

310

311
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:18,279
your network would cost as you add

312
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:20,589
router bypass links<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and and then</font>

313
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:22,899
each line is as you add scale to your

314
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:25,299
network which is basically equates to as

315
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:26,979
the if your network we're doubling every

316
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:30,129
year for instance then you know five

317
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:33,759
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> is two to the six to the fifth 64</font>

318
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:36,369
32 times etc and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number there</font>

319
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,109
the scale the network is plotted so what

320
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:39,939
you see is that and the other thing to

321
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:42,159
say about this graph is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped the</font>

plot at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where if you add</font>

323
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,789
another router bypass link to your

325

<font color="#E5E5E5">not less and what's happening there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

326
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:53,618
if the network that we're modeling here

327
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:57,029
happens to have 18 corn oats so there's

328
00:12:53,619 --> 00:13:00,849
18 x 17 possible bypass links between

329
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:02,529
corn oats and so out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 306 how far</font>

330
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:04,239
did you get before it starts becoming

331
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:06,549
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> expensive than what you see is that</font>

332
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:08,139
low scales it only makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense to add a</font>

333
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:08,920
couple which is sort of where most

00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:10,750
networks have come

335
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,300
from beyond just a few lengths maybe

336
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,010
five they never<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more expensive</font>

00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,260
and what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening is that the demands</font>

the visions the industry that<font color="#E5E5E5"> vision</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">answer is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 gig already starts out</font>

00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:35,439
you're using that and 40 gig now your

374
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,190
lambda is running faster which means

375
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,839
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the demand necessary to make that</font>

whole curve shifts it's just right or

379
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:49,660
left then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> better miss perspective so</font>

380
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:50,769
it makes less and less sense and what's

issues because there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> oao going on</font>

411
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:04,540
so there's no wavelength interchange is

00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:08,649
no regeneration there's no performance

management OMP etc excuse me and also

414
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:11,339
there's wavelength contention and

415
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,509
blocking because there's no wavelength

that what our size are showing is that

435
00:16:55,869 --> 00:17:00,309
through photonic integration technology

436
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:04,089
it becomes very inexpensive to do that

437
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:06,279
and you get at digital protection in the

448
00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:29,439
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not intuitive but what our studies</font>

are showing is as<font color="#CCCCCC"> network scales too</font>

450
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,399
much higher in a few years from now

451
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,939
basically it actually starts to make

452
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:36,100
more sense

453
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,080
to do some amount some of them out of

your protection in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the optical layer</font>

457

study that will further so anyway if you

458
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:52,480
can do things digitally because of

459
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:54,549
because you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> made oao less expensive</font>

460
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,960
yet you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself a degree of</font>

461
00:17:54,549 --> 00:18:00,009
freedom that unconstrained you for

00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,509
digital and drop right so question now

463
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:03,429
is where how we r we going to keep

464
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:05,909
scaling capacity in the future going

465
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:07,929
from 10 to 40 hundred where things going

466
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:11,110
you know there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font>

00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:13,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">to scale capacity ur network there's a</font>

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:26,830
at ten we're kind of hit a roadblock

482
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,500
back and using fancier modulation

483
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,299
approaches and looks like we're starting

484
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,549
down a road where<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would sort</font>

the day things may very well end up much

course there's the also tried and true

these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are really equivalent you</font>

500
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:21,189
really is one of economics and so just

looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at history as a guy here what</font>

502

have we seen with 40 gig those darn

bandwidth increase for four types of

505
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:31,629

<font color="#E5E5E5">four times the cost right wasn't two and</font>

00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:35,860
a half times as we wanted right a lot of

people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will in the transport industry</font>

are now talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred cape coral</font>

basically you're taking 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gig 100</font>

516

channel sending each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> over different</font>

518
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,560
polarizations so doing polarization

division multiplexing across your fiber

520
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,280
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as wavelength division</font>

521
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,860
multiplexing each of those takes more

522
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,470
part in more components and then within

523
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:12,350
each quad each polarization you're doing

524
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:14,600
a qualm for basically trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get two</font>

525
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,709
bits for every symbol across your

526
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,449
network you're basically building a big

527
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,760
modem and what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing so far is</font>

528
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,310
that even<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the 40 gig level that the</font>

529
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,820

<font color="#E5E5E5">published is burning 21 wats to do that</font>

531
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,659
kind of modulation at 40 gig nobody

532
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,100
knows yet what it's going to take a

533
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,900
hundred gig but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is</font>

534
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,090
undoubtedly much more than that so it

535
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,850
becomes very power hungry which equates

536
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,949
to almost directly to cost because power

537
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:43,580
dissipation is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most costly thing to</font>

538
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:45,050
do but also is clear that you require

539
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,620
significant integration to do this

540
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:50,960
approach as well what will cost the the

541
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,429
I saw just last week get a conference

542
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,570
one vendor was suggesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's going</font>

543
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,030
to be about<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and half times the cost</font>

544
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:58,580
of 40<font color="#CCCCCC"> gig</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so for a gig 100 giggly at</font>

00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:00,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">parity on a cost per bit basis well a 40</font>

546

547
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,830
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I we think that people are just</font>

548
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,919
going to stay at 10 gig for<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite some</font>

549
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:09,110
time at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a lot of networks so</font>

550
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:12,290
10 gig of course infinera has been

551
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:14,540
shipping 10 gig 10 channels attending

552
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:16,550
integrated on a single chip photonic

553

554
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:22,690
2004<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and we predicted cost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

555
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:25,160
that's going to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> going down so</font>

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,810
interesting thing about pics is ten by

557
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,170
ten isn't the limit we've published

is much more on trying to increase the

just in its infancy but growing pretty

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,090
fast we've driven by a lot by converged

peer-to-peer video very on-demand all

647
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:26,700
that stuff is really scaling up and you

know pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much most of the SMS out</font>

649
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,450
there the core network will more or less

650
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:33,019
double every couple years so that's

651
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:35,850
that's very high high growth curve<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

it into those existing systems which

687
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:01,720
means more advanced modulation formats

higher spectral efficiency but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

carrier to deploy a whole new WM line

00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:13,360
system then it becomes a tougher<font color="#E5E5E5"> sale</font>

693
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,100
because now there's a big cost

associated with deploying a new system

the technology considerations you've

always got a trade-off complexity for

702
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,570
performance and as you go to more

703
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,160
complex solutions it does drive up the

705
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,240
keep that discipline there and many of

00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the schemes also trade off spectral</font>

00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:53,200
that that involves a reduction in the

710
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,290
signal noise ratio and has a reduction

711
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,630
in the reach

712
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:58,639
another part is that you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

713
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,910
practical electronics so at the moment

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">even if for a gigabit we are using</font>

717

certainly lower cost and the optical

724
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,520
compensator so that's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

725
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:31,070
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got keep in mind as</font>

726
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,510
we as we engineer these solutions and

727
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:34,939
also you can gain a lot of insight from

728
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:36,620
other industries so a lot underseas

729
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,170
other industries have had to fight the

730
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:40,939
spectral efficiency battles before we

731
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:43,370
have an optical so you know you can look

732
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,910
at wireless gsm use some advanced

738
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:02,419
you know high spectral efficiency there

742
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,490

744

thrown a year but

769
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,019
basically there's a map and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">different kinds of modulation formats</font>

771
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:15,619
and you can look at the pros and<font color="#E5E5E5"> cons</font>

772
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:18,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">here we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at spectral</font>

775
00:30:20,989 --> 00:30:24,669
we have something interests and we want

776
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:27,440
to really be in this green quadrant

777
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:29,029
ideally we want to have a spatial

778
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,519
efficiency of two bits per second

779
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:33,259
perhaps that enables you to deploy a

hundred gigabytes on 50 gigahertz

781

782
00:30:36,979 --> 00:30:42,529
signal noise ratio if you get in this

783
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:44,718
this regime of 12 13 14 DB now we're in

784
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:47,119
the regime where we can we can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,500</font>

is basically on-off keying which is

789
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:59,989
pretty much what<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody's used for 10</font>

792
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:05,479
you know that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the simplest</font>

795

814
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,149
rate so you're coding for bits per per

gets you closer to the theoretical limit

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shannons limit as a color on there</font>

824

on signal noise ratio performance so you

825
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:28,200
know there's a lot advanced advanced

<font color="#CCCCCC">intercourse their you know their that</font>

830
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,209
you've got a trade-off between the

831
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:42,150
electronic complexity and the photonic

832

833
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:47,880
that they're easier to implement have

00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:51,840

the the reach are the are the spectral

00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:15,089
tools that can help you get there one is

892
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:17,610
use modulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheme to try and make</font>

894
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,000
operate over current systems and the

895
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,920
other side is to use dynamic

896
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">compensators and you can do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

897
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,660
optically and electrically so some of

898
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:30,060
the key technologies today is an optical

899
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:32,069
tunable dispersion compensator which is

900
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,740
a device called a fiber Bragg grating

901
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,330
which basically the kromagg if you have

large<font color="#CCCCCC"> amounts of chromatic dispersion in</font>

903

the pulse shape batch back together

905
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:46,440
again by this sharp grating which is a

00:35:54,630 --> 00:36:00,420
us a 100 gig as well also we have a

912
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:03,480
polarization more dispersion come

913
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,100
vincere<font color="#CCCCCC"> PMV is they're called</font>

914
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,680
single-mode fibers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they really have</font>

915
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:10,440
two polarization modes and and in older

916
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,149
fibers you can have dispersion between

920
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:23,700
technology moving on to some of the

921
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:26,220
coherent detection schemes when you have

922
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,890
an ATD converter then then into a

923
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,750
digital signal processing chip when

924
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,060
coherent detection one of the advantages

925
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:35,190
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you passed the the optical phase</font>

926
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,650
into the electrical domain that doesn't

927
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,360
happen for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the direct detection</font>

928
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:41,940
mechanisms so now when you pass that

929
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:44,730
phase into the electronic to me now you

930
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,430
can digitize it quantize it and you can

931
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:48,349
use a digital photo

932
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:51,710
finite impulse response filters to

933
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:54,130
combat some of the the nasty optical

934
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:58,520
effects such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> PMD chromatic dispersion</font>

1137
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:43,270
careful staying up here because<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody</font>

1138
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:45,280
might refute that so that's certainly

1139
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:47,680
did a point that I've heard and seen

1140
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,500
presented a few times<font color="#E5E5E5"> but point being</font>

1141
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:54,100
anyway there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of bandwidth with</font>

1142
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:56,710
growth there so again so given all this

1143
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:58,480
where does this take us to obviously

1144
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:00,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to need higher bandwidth to</font>

1145
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,560
to address this growth and I think all

1146

of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the panel are essentially</font>

1149
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:12,220

<font color="#E5E5E5">core networks today people are actually</font>

1151
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:19,089
starting to aggregate sort of multiple

10 gig screams together to to address

1153
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:24,130
the bandwidth demand between some of

1154
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:25,630
these these core pops if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how</font>

1155
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:27,670
you address that higher bandwidth

1156
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:30,640
demanders number of ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could do it</font>

1157
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:32,770
one way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could just use l2 l3 link</font>

pipes together on the right or switch

1160
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:40,359
but really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rely on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

1161
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:43,629
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a scalable solution as we're going</font>

1162
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:45,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously a number of</font>

1166

1167
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:56,049
games used to sort of aggregate traffic

1168
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:59,140
at layer 2 layer 3 it don't scale very

1169
00:46:56,050 --> 00:47:00,940
well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of throughput of those</font>

1170
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,770
are is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> deterministic it very much</font>

1171
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,750
depends on the statistics of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1172
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:06,250
bandwidth and really what that comes out

1173
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:10,990
to if you look at do anything at layer 2

1174
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:13,870
layer 34 x 10 gig does not equal sort of

1175
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:16,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">40k so again we have to be careful when</font>

1176
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:18,400
we're doing these comparisons of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4</font>

1177
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:20,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">x 10 verses for weeks that may not be</font>

1178
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,890
just a straight comparison if you're

1179
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:25,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to do it at layer 2 layer 3 so</font>

1180
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:27,279
the other approach and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess is</font>

1181
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:29,470
what drew was alluding to in his talk is

1182
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well have a nice big fat pipe at</font>

1183
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:35,109
Thea off the router or the switch and

1184
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:37,390
then but we'll still do some aggregation

1185
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:41,950
at layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 so run that over so multiple</font>

1186
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:43,750
lower capacity wavelengths a 10 gig and

1187
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:45,618
address a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those sort of link</font>

1188
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:47,869
adore like issues

1189
00:47:45,619 --> 00:47:49,579
so that against probably got more

1190
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:51,829
Molly's but fundamentally at the end of

1191
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:54,410
the day that approach does not scale as

1192
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:57,440
well because ultimately your DWDM

1193
00:47:54,410 --> 00:48:00,348
systems the ports are not unlimited<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1194
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,210
maybe you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 40 or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ha like a 40 or</font>

1195
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:05,920
80 channel DWDM system in the grind

1196
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:07,849
today and as Ross ministered like

1197
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,160
typically customers want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use up those</font>

1198
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:11,569
ports as efficiently and as slowly as

1199
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,970
possible because once you've used them

1200
00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:15,890
all up it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a it's a fairly major</font>

1201
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:21,259
retrofit to install a whole news or a

1202
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:22,970
DWDM system so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward and so will</font>

1203
00:48:21,259 --> 00:48:25,160
it really just<font color="#CCCCCC"> two is that really you</font>

1204
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:29,480
want to increase wavelength capacity

1205
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:31,910
like as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as it's viable and that</font>

1206
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:35,869
really been moving to higher data rates

1207
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:37,038
/ lambda so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 gig which people</font>

1208
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:39,200
are starting to deploy now and obviously

a hundred big looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">further right and again as Ross</font>

1211
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,279
mentioned that these must operate over

1212
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:49,940
existing infrastructure we can't have to

1213
00:48:46,279 --> 00:48:51,499
just install a whole brand-new transport

1214
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:53,390
infrastructure to be able to carry<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1215

1216
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:57,859
able to run it over the systems that

1217
00:48:55,279 --> 00:48:59,150
were installed like probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> during the</font>

1218
00:48:57,859 --> 00:49:03,109
bubble times which were originally

00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:04,910
installed to carry 10 gig / we're so you

1220

1225
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:19,910
to you typically out people are looking

1226
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:21,019
around sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1,500 kilometers in that</font>

1227
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:22,390
sort of the target we're trying to get

1228

<font color="#CCCCCC">to with some of these new high-speed</font>

bandwidth scrolling it's been

1238
00:49:45,739 --> 00:49:51,739
essentially driven by IP if you look at

layers a service layer that's

1243
00:49:56,599 --> 00:50:01,340
predominantly converging on

1244
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:04,760
p and a transport layer that's really

1245
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:07,220
converging on<font color="#CCCCCC"> two DWDM as the providing</font>

1246
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,380
the connection or the big fat pipes

00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:12,709
between those those service letter

1248
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:13,730
writer or switcher nodes and again is

1249
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,200
interesting to step back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

1250
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:17,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that as well because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been in</font>

1251
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,149
industry for like 25 years first half of

1252
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was working in transport transport</font>

1253
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:24,110
started off pretty as a single service

1254
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:27,590
transport it was providing transport for

1255
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:29,300
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time voice and then over time it</font>

1256
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:31,160
really migrated into more about sort of

1257
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:33,770
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> malted into more</font>

1258
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,839
of a multi-service entity where it was

1259
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:38,450
hard to provide transport not just for

1260
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:40,550
voice but obviously for get in its

1261
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:43,040
various forms like ATM and frame relay

1262
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:44,930
and IP and leased lines and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1263
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,300
stuffs you end up with sort of fairly

1264
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:49,970
complex transport network that had a

1265
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:52,670
whole aggregation they are built in<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1266
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:54,410
handle the these multi services and what

1267
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:56,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">I see going forward is it will actually</font>

1268
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:58,069
migrating back more to a single service

1269
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:00,500
transport network where again the

1270
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:03,830
transport network is really just

1271
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:07,820
providing transport for IP between these

1272
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:10,310
switches and routers and I think again

1273
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:12,470
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a little bit further</font>

1274
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:14,299
right then it makes a lot of sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1275
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:15,950

00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:44,030
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right is the the transport layer</font>

00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:45,200
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was trying to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today is</font>

1287
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,379

1288
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,240
transponders connected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> router so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

predominantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and because</font>

transponders are really a multi-service

00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:07,520
that allow you to connect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport</font>

it is transporting and it sort of makes

00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,829
sense to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that provides a</font>

different service nodes is providing

1303
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:23,719
transport for but again<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we can see in</font>

1306
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:30,440
on the transport here it does require

00:52:28,569 --> 00:52:32,959
what I'm trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show they're like</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">view from the rudder short reach</font>

1309

boxes they're connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

1311
00:52:36,979 --> 00:52:43,819
transponder which then converts it into

00:52:38,779 --> 00:52:45,920
a as a recovered lambda for connection

1313
00:52:43,819 --> 00:52:48,229
across the transport network now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1314
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:51,140
move to the bottom picture which we're

1315
00:52:48,229 --> 00:52:52,759
calling IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wdn this is sort of why</font>

1316
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:55,910
we're looking ok so the transports

1317
00:52:52,759 --> 00:52:59,109
moving more to so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that single service in</font>

1318
00:52:55,910 --> 00:53:02,149
its only providing transport for for IP

1319
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:03,589
in which case then it would seem to make

1320
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:04,759
then a lot of those transponders it

1321
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:06,319
where they are to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> that multi</font>

00:53:04,759 --> 00:53:08,930
service aspect and to provide that<font color="#CCCCCC"> d</font>

00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:12,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">mark point the value of that somewhat</font>

1324
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:18,019
becomes less and less and it allows you

1325
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:20,930
to basically then move the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transport</font>

1326
00:53:18,019 --> 00:53:23,749
that's fine transport into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rider it</font>

1327
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:25,038
itself what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show in the</font>

1328
00:53:23,749 --> 00:53:28,218
bottom so we basically have the colored

1329
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:32,509
objects directly off the router and that

1330
00:53:28,219 --> 00:53:34,160
truly is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort of reducing all of the</font>

1331
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:37,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost because we've taken out a lot of</font>

1332
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:39,529
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> assurance interfaces between the</font>

1333
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:40,940
writer and the transponder a lot of the

1334
00:53:39,529 --> 00:53:43,759
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> optical interconnects between the</font>

00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:45,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">rider and transponder and limited the</font>

1336
00:53:43,759 --> 00:53:46,130
transponders themselves it's basically

1337
00:53:45,019 --> 00:53:47,899
living it's a lot of the common

1338
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:50,150
equipment that it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> around with</font>

1339
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:52,279
actually supporting these transponders

1340
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:54,619
so basically overall allows you to move

1341
00:53:52,279 --> 00:53:59,599
to a much simpler and we believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower</font>

1342
00:53:54,619 --> 00:54:01,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost network is the one marketing slider</font>

1344
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,199
much time on it just other didn't say

1345
00:54:03,319 --> 00:54:09,288
like again this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just chart where</font>

1346
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:10,759
we have a sort of 10 and 40<font color="#E5E5E5"> geek</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TW</font>

1347

1348
00:54:10,759 --> 00:54:14,930
actually deployed sort of in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> field</font>

and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of carrying sort of live</font>

1350
00:54:14,930 --> 00:54:20,509

1351
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:24,558
40 kg<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess deployed over links of up</font>

1352
00:54:20,509 --> 00:54:26,200
to 900 plus kilometers so yeah I just

1353
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:29,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">look a little bit more about 40</font>

1354
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:31,089
100 Gig technology in detail<font color="#E5E5E5"> so 40</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gigs</font>

1355
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:34,479
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we mentioned rudders prefer a</font>

1356
00:54:31,089 --> 00:54:36,820
single 40 gig pipe for the ligand load

1357
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:39,280
balancing limitations customers that we

1358
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:41,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk to prefer single 40 gig per second</font>

1359
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,450
interfaces and primarily that's because

1360
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,060
the teacher<font color="#E5E5E5"> and transport doesn't have</font>

1361
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:48,730
them in reports it's often<font color="#CCCCCC"> viewed as a</font>

1362
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:50,380
fixed and some acid<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> installed in</font>

1363
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:52,780
the grind it's got a certain number of

1364
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:54,940
ports and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would rather turn up</font>

1365
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:58,660
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one port for 40 gig rather than</font>

1366
00:54:54,940 --> 00:55:00,130
burn up sort of four ports and obviously

1367
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:01,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">the druze point like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost is</font>

1368
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:04,410
important in there certainly is a

1369
00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:06,940
balance there but what we're seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I</font>

1370
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:10,060
the people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> prepared to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay a premium</font>

1371
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:13,329
upfront initially to for that spectral

1372
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:15,990
efficiency and<font color="#E5E5E5"> good example out and say</font>

1373
00:55:13,329 --> 00:55:18,640
we've got both<font color="#E5E5E5"> for by 10 gige actually</font>

1374
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:22,839
and 40 gig DW minute is off the rudder

1375
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:24,069
but most of the interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what most</font>

1376
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:25,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">of all were selling is actually sort of</font>

1377
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:28,510
the 40 gig card and not the 4 x 10 gig

1378
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:31,150
card which like somewhat surprised me

1379
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:33,240
because it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> simply cheaper</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> n you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1380
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:36,700
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go a lot further today with it</font>

1381
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:38,290
but we're seeing that basically across

1382
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:42,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">most of the customers we're talking</font>

1383
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:45,160
talking to so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm looking forward in</font>

1384
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:46,990
terms of the modulation technology as

1385
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:50,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ross i mentioned that is advancing</font>

1386
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:53,859
rapidly from like optical geo binary

1387
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:54,880
today to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dpsk to maybe look a</font>

1388
00:55:53,859 --> 00:55:56,380
little bit further right some of the

1389
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,060
coherent technology that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ross was</font>

1390
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:00,490
talking about like what are the bunnies

1391
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:02,140
with the coherent technology is as well

1392
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:05,109
it's actually allows you to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1393
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:07,960
the processing electrically and not

1394
00:56:05,109 --> 00:56:10,779
optically so you basically do a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1395
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,829
an A to D convert right at the front end

1396
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:13,810
your receiver and then you can actually

1397
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:15,550
come and see it for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of these</font>

1398
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:18,578
<font color="#CCCCCC">things like chromatic dispersion in PMD</font>

1399
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:20,020
electrically which again<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately over</font>

1400
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:23,619
time should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be a much lower</font>

in my time<font color="#CCCCCC"> University typically doing</font>

1403
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:30,069

1404
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:31,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">effective than doing things optically so</font>

1405
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:32,710
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready sure that 40 gig today can</font>

00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:34,990
run<font color="#CCCCCC"> over to exist the interior</font>

infrastructure that's typically using

1408
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:39,939
optical geo binary does have some

1409
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:41,379
limitations in terms of

1410
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:44,320
sort of the performance in reach but

1411
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:46,150
with some of these newer technologies

1412
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,760
that are coming on stream over the next

1413
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:51,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">year's that we will be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get 40</font>

1414
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:54,030
gig sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or in some cases</font>

1415
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:58,480
actually exceeding the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten key</font>

1416
00:56:54,030 --> 00:57:00,130
performance and again just from a writer

1417
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,720
perspective key thing there is that all

1418
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:04,300
these advanced modulation schemes can be

1419
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:08,439
integrated and you can drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> it directly</font>

1420
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:10,660
off the router upload so then just

1421
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:13,380
moving a little bit about 100 gig under

1422
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:16,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">D Israel customers are requesting today</font>

1423
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:18,850
both the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITU and the I Triple E are</font>

1424
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:22,000

00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:27,340
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I Triple E I think</font>

1428
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:31,510
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on it for about a</font>

1429
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:32,890
year now keeping us here as well I again

1430
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:34,780
because this is a new standard like

1431
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:36,069
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking 100 gig tomorrow for</font>

1432
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:37,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">the actual height r ability to complete</font>

1433
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:40,000
the standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the schedule is</font>

1434
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:41,470
sort of 2010 so again when you're

1435
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking a lot of this stuff and maybe</font>

1436
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:45,279
comparing<font color="#CCCCCC"> 210d costs you don't want to</font>

1437
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:48,580
be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it today you want to be looking</font>

1438
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:51,250
maybe four or five years like when this

1439
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:54,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">100 gate technology will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be start will</font>

1440
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:55,750
start to be deployed so the other points

1441
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:57,730
methods are pretty much the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1442
00:57:55,750 --> 00:58:00,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">before like a 100 key rudders still</font>

1443
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:01,780
prefer a single 100 gig interface

1444
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:03,609
customers who were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you still</font>

1445
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:07,920
prefer to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a single hundred geek</font>

1446
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:11,410
universe basically 100 gig<font color="#CCCCCC"> pro lambda</font>

1447
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:13,570
that's been achieved at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40k it's</font>

1448
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:16,660
obviously more challenging at a hundred

1449
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:20,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">gigan and but again again as Ross</font>

1450
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:22,930
mentioned that the basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

1451
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:24,520
leverage a lot of the work we we started

1452
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:28,600
at 40 gig in these advanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> modulation</font>

1453
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:30,580
schemes to achieve sort of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

1454
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:34,049
geek / wave length and width sort of

1455
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:36,009
equivalent performance to 10g and again

1456
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:37,060
this from my<font color="#CCCCCC"> perspective what's</font>

1457
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:39,010
important is that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1458
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:40,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Ross is talking about can be</font>

1459
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:45,190
integrated directly onto the writer as

1460
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:47,520
well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just quickly to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap up IP</font>

1461
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:50,470
traffic is of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to grow as</font>

1462
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:53,570
we've mentioned what that means is we

1463
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:55,040
need fatter pipes not more pipes

1464
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:58,040
we need that both with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service level</font>

1465
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,020
like it the writer as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned you</font>

1466
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:02,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ligand load balancing limitations</font>

1467
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:03,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">I also believe that fundamentally we're</font>

1468
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:06,230
going to need<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at the transport</font>

1469
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:08,600
layer as well because that transport

1470
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:10,330
systems do not have unlimited ports so

1471
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:16,460
we have to look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at continuing to</font>

1472
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:18,259
increase the speed per wavelength that

1473
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:21,740
does require advanced modulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1474
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:24,170
months that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fodder</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pipes were</font>

1475
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:26,000
looking at both 10 and 100 geek do need

1476
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:29,180
eltima to match the performance of the

1477
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,530
skinny pipes today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again that's</font>

1478
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:32,060
probably going to be in performance both

1479
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:35,900
in terms of distance and ultimately in

1480
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:37,610
terms of cost as well now we see the

1481
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:42,050
network convert into two layers as

1482
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:44,630
service in transport and then a closer

1483
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:46,520
coupling of those two layers we believe

1484
00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:50,030
is the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious step in network</font>

1485
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:53,320
evolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

1486
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:53,320
that's it thank you very much

1487
00:59:59,509 --> 01:00:03,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap this up here</font>

1488
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:04,980
for us guys up on the panel then we're

1489
01:00:03,029 --> 01:00:06,210
an open up to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys like I said I</font>

1490
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,799
want to give the panel us a few minutes

1491
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:09,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask each other questions if they have</font>

1492
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:14,130
questions like we used to do in the old

1493
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:15,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">days of nanog and just kind of reiterate</font>

1494
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:17,759
what they say else agree we're kind of

1495
01:00:15,809 --> 01:00:19,980
moving into a binary world ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1496
01:00:17,759 --> 01:00:21,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">zeros IP and transport optical and</font>

1497
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:23,490
they're all going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the same thing</font>

1498
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:25,558
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a it's best for everyone start</font>

1499

paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to learn it there are</font>

1500

some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually working on optical</font>

1501
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:32,039
routers as in like light and it's not

1502
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:33,599
just science projects any more inward

1503
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:35,490
universities there are a little startup

1504
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:38,460
incubators looking at this stuff so it's

1505
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:41,249
coming for real um so with that we'll

1506
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:44,309
open it up drew Gary Ross do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll have</font>

1517
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:16,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh for South nice maybe you can repeat</font>

1518
01:01:14,009 --> 01:01:19,140
my question um you guys talked a lot

1519
01:01:16,349 --> 01:01:20,940
about a physical error stuff it's an

1520
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:23,970
optical panel I understand what I'm

1521
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:25,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">curious to know is whether eventually</font>

1522
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:28,200
we're going to hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can plug in</font>

1523
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,669
100<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gig circuits or interfaces in two</font>

1524
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:32,279
routers which sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of means that</font>

1525
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:34,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">eventually we're going to need all three</font>

1526
01:01:32,279 --> 01:01:35,789
engines that can can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a hundred gig</font>

1527
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,920
we're going to need be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okie chips that</font>

1528
01:01:35,789 --> 01:01:40,190
can do 100 gig we're going to need<font color="#E5E5E5"> l2</font>

1529
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,960
framing and all of that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 100 gig</font>

1530
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:44,549
what is your sense the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a generic</font>

1531
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,220
question what if what is your sense

1532
01:01:44,549 --> 01:01:49,440
about where that technology is as

1533
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:55,828
compared to where sort of the phi tech

1534
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:57,869
nology is today it's definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long</font>

1535
01:01:55,829 --> 01:02:00,869
pole in the tent there's certainly a lot

1536
01:01:57,869 --> 01:02:03,420
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people working on it and there are no</font>

1537
01:02:00,869 --> 01:02:06,299
chips available today as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

1538
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:07,950
and hopefully I know what's most most of

1539
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:11,460
what's out there but

1540
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:13,560
I think that's their third maybe three

1541
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:22,470
long poles I said that's definitely one

1542
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:24,960
of them hello yeah yeah so I guess the

1543
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:27,270
short answer is yes where are they in

1544
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:32,369
terms of I guess I'm an engineer so I

1545
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:33,780
better be careful what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say here yeah</font>

1546
01:02:32,369 --> 01:02:36,170
both there's definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> drew said</font>

1547
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:38,099
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> advances in terms of the engine</font>

1548
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:39,660
technology there's obviously advances in

1549
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:41,490

1550
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:42,450
rumors of I just to do like the shortage

1551
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:44,910
interfere it's like how do we get a

1552
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:46,109
hundred key short reach interface across

1553
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:48,299
the office and then how do we get 100

01:02:46,109 --> 01:02:51,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">gig across the country so there's really</font>

1555
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:52,470
there was three aspects to it I think

1556
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:57,030
there's active work going on in all

1557
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:58,740
three three three<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas right now as I</font>

1558
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:00,240
mentioned before like this has been

01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:07,589
worked on<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the I Triple E and the</font>

01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:10,169

01:03:07,589 --> 01:03:12,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">to probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drivin probably 2010 I guess</font>

1562
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:14,730
for that to be sort of fully ratified

1563
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:16,529
and i would expect all of those three

1564
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:18,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">components to be available in that by</font>

1565
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:22,740
that time frame maybe it's the best way

1566
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:24,899
to put it the other component or the

1567
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:27,299
other piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i forgot to</font>

with optical is a hundred gig just a

1572
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:41,910
to look like talking power dissipation

01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:43,859
or optical power on the fiber power

1574
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:45,569
dissipate our requirements and heat

1575
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:46,770
dissipation on the line card that was

1576
01:03:45,569 --> 01:03:49,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually going to be my question to</font>

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys actually you guys I think the</font>

1578
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:56,160
target of goal is obviously to try and

1579
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:59,099
do 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig within the same power budget</font>

1581
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:06,960
40 gig per slot because yeah exactly

1582
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:10,740
it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a head they're kind of 100 to</font>

1584
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:14,189
agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> drew is that's not a major</font>

1585
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:16,800

that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the power consumption</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Perseids up a big cost element certainly</font>

1592
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:33,579
a fascinating thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's going</font>

short reach link within a pop or

something between a router and transport

1603
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:05,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just curious what's going to happen</font>

1604
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:07,059
when when people can buy multimode fiber

1607
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:16,210
the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened with 10 gigabit</font>

1608
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:18,640
right and the problem is none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font>

1609
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:20,589
carriers<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their of that multi more</font>

1610
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:23,680
driven<font color="#E5E5E5"> five are distributed in through</font>

1611
01:05:20,589 --> 01:05:25,109
the distribution frame so you know even

1612
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:27,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">though there's a big cost differences</font>

1613
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:28,839
I'd imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be an</font>

1614
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:31,630
issue there that you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1615
01:05:28,839 --> 01:05:33,400
go above the 300-meter reach and you

1616
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:36,279
know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

1617
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:38,289
to deploy new multimode fiber and even

1618
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:40,839
though there's a 40<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig there's a</font>

1619
01:05:38,289 --> 01:05:42,760
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously a big premium there</font>

1620
01:05:40,839 --> 01:05:45,670
as well I mean 40<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shortridge</font>

1621
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:48,069
interface is a single you know cecee

1622
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:49,599
deol 40 gig interface is expensive as

1623
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:51,520
gary said that's why there's value in

1624
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:53,920
integrating the WM on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> router there</font>

1625
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:57,490
so yeah if it's not going to happen

1626
01:05:53,920 --> 01:06:00,160
there I'd still be surprised if those

1627
01:05:57,490 --> 01:06:02,348
carriers are going to go for the the

1628
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:04,058
pain and investment of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Putin up</font>

1631
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:11,049
tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened to 10 gig</font>

1632
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:13,329
though and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> has some you have</font>

some<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience on unzipping multimode</font>

1634
01:06:13,329 --> 01:06:18,400

1635
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:22,329
again his raw<font color="#CCCCCC"> soluti we actually came up</font>

1636
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:24,279
with a scheme called OC 192 VSR at 10

1639
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:31,539
1999 was extremely expensive and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we come</font>

sort of ribbon fiber

1642
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:37,879
it was significantly cheaper but again

1643
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:40,040
it was not widely accepted by the

1644
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:44,839

1646
01:06:44,839 --> 01:06:49,069
the advantage of driving down the cost

01:08:24,529 --> 01:08:29,239
to have launched power that's

1687
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:32,420
unrealistic yet I mean you get one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

1688
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:33,769
when you go from PS k to qpsk quadrature

1689
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:35,719
phase-shift keying you can double a

1690
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:37,160
capacity and it doesn't actually heart

1691
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:39,170
you in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> second or noise ratio</font>

1692
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:41,599
that kind of comes for free but every

1693
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:44,989
time you go you go beyond that two more

1694
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:47,029
levels and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> clam constellation if you</font>

1695
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:49,099
like now when you got more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more</font>

1696
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:51,830
levels you basically trade-off spectral

1697
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:53,330
efficiency for for reach so you know

1698
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:55,580
this if you want to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher</font>

1699
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:57,859
spectral efficiency you might have to do

1700
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:59,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">something a little bit cleverer and the</font>

1701
01:08:57,859 --> 01:09:02,000
optical<font color="#CCCCCC"> lane system but then that means</font>

1702
01:08:59,929 --> 01:09:05,000
changing the infrastructure so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1703
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,040
if you deploy more<font color="#CCCCCC"> EDF es you reduce the</font>

1704
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,198
the amplifier space and you know it kind

1705
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">of looks like a submarine system fair</font>

1706
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:12,678
enough then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can you got better</font>

1707
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:14,028
signal noise ratio or you deploy some

1708
01:09:12,679 --> 01:09:16,190
other techniques on the optical wine

1709
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:17,660
system like ramen amplifiers they can

1710
01:09:16,189 --> 01:09:19,879
also boost the optical signal noise

1711
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:22,219
ratio so you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to go to</font>

1712
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:24,830
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1500 coma or reach and even higher</font>

1713
01:09:22,219 --> 01:09:26,630
spectral efficiency you've really<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta</font>

1714
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:30,318
go do something clever over the lane

1715
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:32,779
system part of our perspective though is

1716
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:34,370
that spectral efficiency is is an issue

1717
01:09:32,779 --> 01:09:35,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you're limiting yourself to the</font>

1718
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:37,640
c-band if you can get yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

1719
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:40,100
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> c-band and open up the spectrum then</font>

1720
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:43,130
it matters less how efficient you are at

1721
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:45,199
least for a given for capacity level so

1722
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:49,009
if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the S fanned open the</font>

1723
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:51,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">obin even there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much bands here then</font>

1724
01:09:49,009 --> 01:09:53,120
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start buying capacity without</font>

1725
01:09:51,649 --> 01:09:54,469
having to increase dramatically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1726
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,719
spectral efficiency and then if you can

1727
01:09:54,469 --> 01:09:59,600
if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other approaches to</font>

1728
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:01,810
modulation that have lower power then

1729
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:05,420
that might equate the lower<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1730
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:09,140
there's a very very large number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1731
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:12,560
factors that go into this equation yeah

1732
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:15,530
yeah okay and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you mention the</font>

1733
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:20,000
bypass router model you didn't mention

1734
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:24,110
the control plane and specifically not

1735
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:27,199
GM pls mentioned so wonder that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was and</font>

1736
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:34,790
purpose or there's some development

1737
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:37,669
there too that was a time limit<font color="#E5E5E5"> true</font>

1738
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:40,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">statement or one of those presentations</font>

1739
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:42,800
and up and I'm kind of preface this with

1740
01:10:40,699 --> 01:10:44,780
beware of transport vendors pitching

1741
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rodin's and optical transport control</font>

1742
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:49,160
planes that automatically switch and do

1743
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:50,600
one for n protection because what they

1744
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:52,880
don't understand is when neighbor

1745
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:55,730
adjacencies change and physical paths

1746
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:56,719
change and what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the router ID one</font>

1747
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:59,299
second ago is an

1748
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:03,920
router ID now is not protection<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1749
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:05,539
disruption be careful yeah transport

1750
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:09,860
people love that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'll</font>

1751
01:11:05,539 --> 01:11:13,429
understand control planes well there is

1752
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:15,018
it it's a whole lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> metal there's a</font>

1753
01:11:13,429 --> 01:11:17,269
whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work that's gone on for a</font>

1754
01:11:15,019 --> 01:11:22,179
decade probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine decade i guess but</font>

1755
01:11:17,269 --> 01:11:24,380
eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> years on GM pls control planes and</font>

1756
01:11:22,179 --> 01:11:25,940
certainly major router vendors support

1757
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:28,940
GM pls<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's a whole lot more work</font>

1758
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:30,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be done there I didn't even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put a</font>

1759
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:32,360
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide in as you noted here but</font>

1760
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:34,339
I've gone to multi-day conferences

1761
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:38,589
solely than that yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might on my</font>

1762
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:38,590
panel if you did<font color="#E5E5E5"> just teasing</font>
