1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:11,639
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> dumb registries allocate address</font>

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:19,650
space and ISPs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> end users announcer</font>

3
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:22,830
yeah so ipv6 how much is being used how

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:28,220
much is being allocated notice that for

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:30,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">instance in Aaron we have a fairly steep</font>

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:35,790
allocation curve in the last couple

7
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:38,040
years and that announcements are moving

8
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,260
up people are you can't say it's used

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,250
but it's announced<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is the closest</font>

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:47,218
we get from<font color="#E5E5E5"> used today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay in oops</font>

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,519
let's go the other way ap Nick you

12
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,399
notice it's linear um this this bump

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:59,809
you'll see and everybody that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

14
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:05,339
change in policy this is the change from

15
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:07,048
35 2 32's or whatever it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and so you</font>

16
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">see a bunch more prefixes announced in</font>

17
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,740
that area wait a minute should be the

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,509
other way whatever there's changing

19
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,520
general socially how we do it so we see

20
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,350
a bump<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see AP nick is a fairly</font>

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,439
linear curve and look at the

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:27,240
announcement flattening so since about

23
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:29,339
two thousand and two in AP neck people

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,220
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been getting more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and more address</font>

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:37,380
space but not a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them have been</font>

26
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:40,020
deploying it okay in ripe whose business

27
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,060
is essentially selling address space

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,600
because the new member you get it

29
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:50,189
there's this curve going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up again</font>

30
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:57,270
flattening in actual announcements okay

31
00:01:50,189 --> 00:02:02,478
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> LAC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick again steep curve for</font>

32
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:08,910
allocation flattening and announcements

33
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:10,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">afrinic same story</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

34
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,060
just to give you a feeling of the delay

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,940
between allocation and announcement I'm

36
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:21,960
the vertical is when the first announced

37
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:27,120
was heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> the horizontal is when it was</font>

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:29,010
allocated okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's nice not to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,950
too many people announcing<font color="#CCCCCC"> before it was</font>

40
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,769
allocated and we have a fairly

41
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,280
consistent story here that the same

42
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:40,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is true with a penis the same</font>

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,900
things true with ripe except we seem to

44
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,470
have some eager beavers and ripe on

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:50,970
these folk in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lower-right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to</font>

46
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:57,660
have jumped the gun there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> lack Nick</font>

47
00:02:50,970 --> 00:03:01,500
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> AfriNIC similarly prefix allocation</font>

48
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:08,609
the distribution of allocations um we

49
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:13,920
see again steep curve for ripe just

50
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:18,420
pumping<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff out next comes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AP</font>

51
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,769
Nick a panic sorry I guess that's why

52
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,000
it's a steep curve<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're panicking</font>

53
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:27,930
there and um but look at the difference

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron again a hockey stick curve and</font>

55
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,500
this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sales projection which is</font>

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,090
where we're used to seeing hockey stick

57
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:39,090
curves this is actual delivery of IP

58
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,930
addresses from AP from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron to</font>

59
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:46,200
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay did we see the same thing</font>

60
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:49,020
in deployment if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that</font>

61
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,290
announcement is deployment we see

62
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:57,320
flattening a tripe we see flattening

63
00:03:52,290 --> 00:04:00,600
with some rise in in AP Nick we see

64
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:05,549
serious uptake you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

65
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:09,959
derivative is positive in our region

66
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:12,930
here and flatten the other two so what

67
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,150
we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if we can ears we can</font>

68
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,478
get without you know we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play</font>

69
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,090
some more sophisticated games the actual

70
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:21,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">utilization is though we're behind the</font>

71
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">other</font>

72
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:29,550
two big registries in deployment we have

73
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,760
a steeper curve<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and this just so</font>

74
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:36,770
you know the data analysis is done from

75
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:42,000
route fuchs & R tripower is data but

76
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:46,049
morally<font color="#CCCCCC"> maling yingling at umich okay</font>

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,330
and then we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a second</font>

78
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,940
one just for free<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I can figure out</font>

79
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:57,000
how to operate this let's see if I do

80
00:04:50,940 --> 00:05:04,280
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then do this will it work whoo</font>

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,960
I am NOT a sophisticated Windows user

82
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,109
let's do kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar thing for</font>

83
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,909
legacy data totally different analysis a

84
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:20,220
different grad student um the same

85
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:24,900
institution<font color="#CCCCCC"> umesh um the aaron gives us</font>

86
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:28,410
a file that says these are the legacy

87
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:35,640
allocations okay how those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are to find</font>

88
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:39,750
etc we don't know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at bgp from</font>

89
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:45,710
route views we see four kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

90
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:52,950
that prefix is announced perfect match

91
00:05:45,710 --> 00:06:03,150
okay what we see is the allocation is a

92
00:05:52,950 --> 00:06:05,909
super net of what we see in BGP so these

93
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:12,049
folk fragmented it or only<font color="#E5E5E5"> announced</font>

94
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:16,700
part of it the turquoise folk these folk

95
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:19,170
announced something bigger um a

96
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,510
significant number of those are likely

97
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:24,750
somebody was given 2 24's and they're

98
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:29,659
announcing the 23 okay we haven't done

99
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:32,160
breakdown analysis of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font>

100
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:36,900
unmatched data

101
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,840
note we see no<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcement at all for</font>

102
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:44,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">the legacy address space notice this is</font>

103
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:48,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">fairly flat somewheres on the order of</font>

104
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">fifty-six percent of legacy space is</font>

105
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:59,330
utterly unannounced pardon me fifty-six

106
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:02,190
percent of legacy prefixes by count

107
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:05,180
we're in a day or so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

108
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:10,850
analysis broken down by 24 equivalents

109
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:15,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the masculine</font>

110
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we see the clump at 16 and we</font>

111
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:23,310
see the curve up at towards the old<font color="#CCCCCC"> sea</font>

112
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:29,670
space here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the classic a space okay um</font>

113
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:33,780
and so 24 we expect this spike those of

114
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:36,360
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> that remember is dr. pastel took 24</font>

115
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:40,919
and sliced and diced it out to the cable

116
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:44,990
modem providers and so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot</font>

117
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:53,040
of announcements from within that space

118
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:55,710
okay um be space um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know why it</font>

119
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,710
starts at 140 that's kind of the data we

120
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:02,280
got should start a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little further to the</font>

121
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:04,109
left<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have been my guess okay or</font>

122
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,710
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the first unannounced we</font>

123
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:11,970
saw and the universities were in 128 129

124
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:17,640
etc classy space there's what swamp

125
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:22,590
looks like boys<font color="#CCCCCC"> and girls and again the</font>

126
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:24,830
folk at<font color="#CCCCCC"> new umich so and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

127
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,830
story

128
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,880
you
