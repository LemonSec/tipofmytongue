1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
week on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thursday to try to get it done</font>

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,970
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll see what happens but the</font>

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,350
program committee needs to hit the

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">ground</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running with planning for the</font>

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,768
next meeting as soon as possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

6
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:16,279
sooner this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is done the better program</font>

7
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,359
for this time we had 24 submissions

8
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:19,948
those are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones that actually went</font>

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the way through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system and made</font>

10
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,810
it in and showed up as in our system is

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,139
being ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> first review of those we</font>

12
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,019
accepted 13 it's not mentioned here but

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,000
the ones that we didn't accept found the

14
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,829
two broad categories one being it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,690
marketing talk the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one being that</font>

16
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,450
it was submitted<font color="#CCCCCC"> too late after we had</font>

17
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,209
already filled the agenda which leads me

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,340
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worth one</font>

19
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,110
after we have fewer Boston tutorials

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,059
submitted this time<font color="#E5E5E5"> than we usually do</font>

21
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,769
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of surprising but we</font>

22
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,589
needed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time anyway from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our plenary</font>

23
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,690
so it worked out but we're kind of

24
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,300
surprised by the lack of especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob</font>

25
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,579
submissions this time don't know what

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,010
caused<font color="#CCCCCC"> it maybe just a fluke maybe it's</font>

27
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,449
a trend I don't know we completed the

28
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,619
agenda early this time it was actually

29
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,030
published more than a<font color="#E5E5E5"> month before the</font>

30
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,020
meeting which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first time that I</font>

31
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">can recall that you ever done that</font>

32
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,350
certainly since I've been in charge I

33
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,250
mean I suspect ran had something to do

34
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:16,229
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that we did at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

35
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:17,909
the argument for doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was that</font>

36
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,460
made a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get travel</font>

37
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,040
approval if you could show your bosses

38
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,289
with the agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't it we something</font>

39
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,420
worth sending somebody to the

40
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,640
disadvantage for us perhaps was that

41
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,040
there was less flexibility in the

42
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,970
program of the last few<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks perhaps</font>

43
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,650
they might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been some interesting</font>

44
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,140
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that came up that we could have</font>

45
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,820
stuck in it wasn't as big a problem as I

46
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,400
feared<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might be but it still did come</font>

47
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,679
up and it struck me that the solution to

48
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,119
that could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to hold back a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,820
time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> last-minute stuff and use of</font>

50
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,960
lightning talks if nothing else so not a

51
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,960
big deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with something to think about</font>

52
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,820
so it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a two-to-one</font>

53
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:05,100
ratio of accepted to our submissions to

54
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,389
accept it could you give us a little bit

55
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,799
more idea of how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those were</font>

56
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:13,290
submitted and rejected because it just

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,360
were too late and also

58
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,510
this is better than we've had before

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,819
right in terms of raw numbers it's

60
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,230
actually a bit lower although i will say

61
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,260
there were a couple things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't</font>

62
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:29,209
submitted because the person asked after

63
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:34,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes too late and we said don't bother</font>

64
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:36,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">but this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time we have a few more panels</font>

65
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,989
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> eat up a lot more time so it</font>

66
00:02:36,629 --> 00:02:42,659
really worked out<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

67
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,370
average we had a lower number of

68
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:50,370
submissions but higher average quality

69
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:57,689
so it worked out I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm ready</font>

70
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:59,669
to declare a trend though yeah yeah it

71
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:01,200
does make a difference we only have a

72
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:03,540
limited amount of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the plenary</font>

73
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,970
because of the joint meeting so we have

74
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,840
a bit less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> usual although there to</font>

75
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,579
be honest there are some other things

76
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,250
that we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done which decrease the total</font>

77
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:12,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">plan every time one of them is adding</font>

78
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,030
lightning talks another one is adding a

79
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,859
keynote these are all<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that have</font>

80
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,359
generally gotten positive responses so

81
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,579
this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

82
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:23,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">later but these are things that we</font>

83
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:27,299
intend to continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> as long as you folks</font>

84
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,228
the community thinks it's valuable if

85
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:32,090
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's valuable then</font>

86
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:36,690
please tell us them do different things

there we've jointly operated the list

142
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,379
since pre Vegas pre the actual charter

143
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:53,340
the community basically got together and

144
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">so they wanted to kind of run things and</font>

job to your appointments by the SC

154
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,948
basically it's fired forget

155
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,659
fire-and-forget means that they appoint

156
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:29,409
and can remove people from the committee

Merritt is up to us we appoint our own

consensus with merit and the community

00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:02,050
probably 05 or early 06 we all know who

168

it is and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to propose that</font>

but we'll post that to the futures list

173
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:20,469
I think it's fairly low list<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

we've had some discussion on the list

the previous group and and the last week

186
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,449
we pulled it all together and<font color="#CCCCCC"> put these</font>

187
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,430
bullet points together and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good</font>

188
00:08:55,449 --> 00:09:00,699
this is our proposal basically for the

189
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,819
new AUP and we've condensed it down to

190
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:04,870
some very focused bullet points

191
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:06,430
discussions will focus on internet

192
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,620
operational and technical issues as

193
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:13,079
described in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> charter of nanog you'll</font>

194
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:15,790
notice that we removed what was the word

195
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:17,469
discouraged and we we eliminated the

196
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,680
wishy-washy language and said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

197
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,620
prohibited period plus it postings of

198
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,420
issues inconsistent with the Charter

199
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:29,259
cross-posting postings that include foul

200
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,699
language the usual product marketing not

201
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:33,009
just blatant product marketing but

202
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:35,229
product marketing political

203
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:36,519
philosophical legal unless you're a

204
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,800
lawyer I think we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> make an</font>

205
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,060
exception for lawyers but then again I

206
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,670
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a lawyer would post legal</font>

207
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,199
advice on a node and using the list as a

208
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,560
source for<font color="#E5E5E5"> private marketing initiatives</font>

209
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:48,758
initiatives this is the one where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

210
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,279
probably many of us get mail

211
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,290
occasionally unsolicited from people

212
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,120
that want to sell us routers and things

213
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,410
and they have an eBay business or

214
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and they're subscribe to the</font>

215
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:00,639
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there it doesn't really look</font>

216
00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:02,949
like spam but it kind of is so we added

217
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,329
that in there and generally we came up

218
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:06,040
with a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of methodology of how</font>

219
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:07,599
we want to run the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list and and that is</font>

220
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,149
the list should reflect the activities

221
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,860
of the conference and if you can't point

222
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:14,649
to the list as a justification that tend

223
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,450
the conference we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically losing so</font>

224
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:18,280
it's kind of a circle I think

225
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,040
you know if there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> topics that are</font>

226
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,650
pervasive on the list perhaps the PC

227
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,290
could look at them and suggest topics

228
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,660
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference and if the mailing</font>

229
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:30,160
list isn't generating that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

230
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,780
activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the SC can appoint</font>

231
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:37,260
different people and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth</font>

232
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:40,449
and seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit cohesive so</font>

233
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:46,030
AUP adherence and support basically this

234
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:48,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">is another not fully consensus proposal</font>

235
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:50,650
but should be there's some process that

236
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,449
needs to go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind the scenes but</font>

237
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,069
we've got some of that done but

238
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,390
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this is what we're</font>

239
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,170
presenting to you we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

posters behavior not on the list and

242
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,680
we'll see comments that address the

243
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,300
relevancy of a thread will be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,780
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> but velocity consensus-based</font>

245
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:13,150
amongst the administrators<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mlc will</font>

246
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,130
seek internal consensus on<font color="#CCCCCC"> warnings so</font>

247
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,430
when someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets a warning it'll mean</font>

248
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:20,350
that the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> mlc stands behind that</font>

249
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:23,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">the AUP non-conformance is equally</font>

250
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:26,440
weighted so there's no minor crimes or

251
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,960
major crimes you violate the AUP it's

252
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,050
just like on your network either you do

253
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,210
or you don't roll call votes for

254
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:36,219
subscriber bands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and/or reinstatement so</font>

255
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:40,090
there's a way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can be put off</font>

256
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:45,480
and put back on as well as the appeals

basically to stop some D gases from

spammers and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">think there's some other things and put</font>

to hold monthly meetings and post the

00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:30,399
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting better at informing a</font>

296
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:34,059
poster that what they've done violates

297
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:38,800
this specific AUP process and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

298
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:42,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a an informal one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mlc member comment</font>

299
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,559
as opposed to a mlc warning yes we

300
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,050
always we always specify whether it's

301
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,629
official mlc warning or this is a

302
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:53,649
friendly note please change your

303
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:56,199
behavior or else so in email it's only

304
00:13:53,649 --> 00:14:02,259
specific whether it's a born in for an

305
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:07,240
average know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we always do that with well</font>

306
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:12,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay sound there is no consensus on that</font>

307
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:15,850
one we try to I think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in range</font>

308
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:24,370
yeah I understand what the ranges<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

309
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:27,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">tonight okay let's uh next a major</font>

311
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,070
Lucy Lynch as a long time not that same

312

slide as a long time list master there

313
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,680
are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things in here that that give me</font>

314
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> heebie-jeebies prohibited for lack</font>

315
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,550
of respect and prohibited for

316
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:50,250
philosophical does that mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font>

317
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,780
mention Spinoza on the list both of

318
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,320
those are really spongy what do those

319
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:57,329
mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty self obvious</font>

320
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,480
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want long-winded</font>

321
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:02,070
discussions about which really don't

322
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">have anything to do with technology or</font>

323
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:09,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">operation or engineering if it's a</font>

324
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:12,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">nonspecific network operation discussion</font>

325
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,370
that does not belong on the list and if

326
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:17,280
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention Spinoza and you</font>

327
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:22,680
somehow it is operational then be my

328
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:25,130
guest<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think philosophical will</font>

329
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:30,780
come back to bite you but we'll see

330
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:38,460
could you go forward one foil please at

331
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:41,370
14 yes I would note that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> says that</font>

332
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:44,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MLC will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

333
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:50,850
doesn't say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will tell them the status</font>

334
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:53,700
of that message this is the broad policy

335
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,950
that we agreed on there may be a more

336
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,740
specific one that we will you know

337
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:07,880
internally use but we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely</font>

338
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:07,880
will be more clear like microphone

339

345
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:32,810
issue that happened on futures but he

346
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,750
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to be clear on is it a warning</font>

347
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:39,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">or not a warning right Randy okay okay</font>

351
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,920
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a warning or not a</font>

352
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:02,959
warning but it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be in</font>

353
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,359
our role<font color="#CCCCCC"> as an mlc member so it's going</font>

354
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nanogram</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> LC member but if it has</font>

355
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,770
the full backing of the community it'll

356
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:11,990
say representing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MLC how's that and</font>

357
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,270
we'll we'll send an update of these

358
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:18,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides to the list by tomorrow before</font>

359
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:19,639
your meeting and hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll answer</font>

360
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,470
that question or you know address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

361
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,880
concern but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> works viewed I think</font>

362
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:30,320
that's easy for us to do and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works</font>

363
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:31,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">for us okay one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font>

364
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,168
from the slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> that may be worth</font>

365
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,610
spelling out is that the there are two

366
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:36,080
sections<font color="#E5E5E5"> here there is the internal</font>

367
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,689
policy of how the mentalist is run

368
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,030
process yes of how the man list goes

369
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,400
about yes this one this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is internal</font>

370
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,678
party ready clear on the screen right so

371
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,299
that internal policy as<font color="#CCCCCC"> as far</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as I</font>

372
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,100
understand it is entirely up to the

373
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:51,049
mentalist committee to work out itself

374
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,370
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's great that you're being</font>

375
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:54,830
able to publish that and it's very good

376
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:59,418
for transparency for members of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list</font>

377
00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:01,129
who have been I was like yeah right the

378
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:03,770
first part the acceptable use policy is

379
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,030
slightly different in that I think the

380
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,889
work you've done in trying to sort of

381
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,570
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the changes together like that it's</font>

382
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,000
fantastic and you've saved the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SE a huge</font>

383
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:15,200
amount of work which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome thank</font>

384
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,549

385
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,780
wanted to make about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is that this</font>

386
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:19,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">is slightly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different to the other stuff</font>

387
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,990
in that the formal ratification of this

388
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,050
is done by the steering committee absol

389
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a demon in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the school yes yes that's</font>

390
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:28,730

395
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:40,309
taking initiative to put this out so

396
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:46,090
that it can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> considered I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:03,040
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've done or at least been</font>

424
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,900
doing since the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last nanog meeting in</font>

425
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,730
this slide is things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've actually</font>

426
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,260
implemented for this meeting or are

427
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:12,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">things we've actually accomplished so</font>

428
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:15,460
far instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having individual cameras</font>

429
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:18,399
that are pointing at the podium and the

430
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,770
head table and each audience camera we

431
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,930
moved to pan tilt zoom cameras that can

432
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:25,540
be controlled<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the room</font>

433
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,980
so in the event that for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> Randy</font>

434
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,960
gives a talk we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually follow him</font>

435
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,560
around the stage without having camera

436
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,330
operators all over the room and that's

437
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,679
done with a camera can PTZ camera

438
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:44,320
controller so we've got joystick control

439
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:47,830
pan tilt zoom brightness all sorts

440
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,370
controls for each of the cameras we've

441
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:54,250
also been trying to get some update to

442
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:57,070
our encoder hardware thus far we've been

443
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:59,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">either using a laptop with real media</font>

444
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,899
running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least for the past</font>

445
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,810
year year and a half or so using AV

446
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:11,290
brick appliance that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get on loan from</font>

447
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:14,290
internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> to we are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to upgrade at</font>

448
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:17,710
least the the processing<font color="#E5E5E5"> power of the</font>

449
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:21,149
encoder to hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> someday offer HD or</font>

450
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:24,160
just better-looking video and slide

451
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:27,790
capture as well in doing that we've also

452
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,880
been evaluating new encoder software and

453
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:33,460
settled on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> package called wire cast in</font>

454
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,540
working with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matt Peterson from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

455
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:42,130
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> he suggested this it offers a</font>

456
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:44,889
lot a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more user-friendly views of</font>

457
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,960
the of the content it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have sort of</font>

458
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,910
picture and picture slides with video so

459
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,600
it's not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> just switching back and</font>

460
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:54,490
forth between slides or cameras you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

461
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,370
have multiple cameras in one view so you

462
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,890
can do QA with the presenter and the

463
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:02,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">audience</font>

464
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:04,740
within one window so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it offers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

465
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:07,940
more functionality we purchased the

466
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:12,060
encoder hardware we've got a actually a

467
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:14,220
very large dell desktop unit that's too

468
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,500
big for our liking but is supposedly the

469
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,390
most powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that we could find</font>

470
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:21,540
and have loaded it with the Wirecast

471
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:23,010
software although right now we are still

472
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:27,300
experimenting with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at this meeting</font>

473
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:29,070
and are getting used to it it's not the

474
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,070
the be-all end-all solution for us right

475
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:36,000
now but it is a step forward at least

476
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:37,710
for demoing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at this meeting other</font>

477
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that included in that demo i</font>

478
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:45,140
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wirecast we also are working</font>

479
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:48,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">with matt peterson we got a loan of a</font>

480
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,680
hdv camera from internet too they

481
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:53,520
shipped<font color="#E5E5E5"> one after their member meeting</font>

482
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:57,110
that we are having direct fire wire over

483
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,760
fiber as input into the encoder hardware

484
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,530
right now we capture everything with

485
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,790
s-video cables or either s-video

486
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:08,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">baylin's over cat5 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the s-video just</font>

487
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:10,290
leaves a lot to be desired so we're

488
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,270
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a way to at least get some</font>

489
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:15,600
sort of high-speed firewire in directly

490
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:18,150
into the encoder box we are tunneling

491
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,850
the unicast feed back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ann arbor we've</font>

492
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:23,670
had different experiences depending on

493
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:26,219
where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in which provider were</font>

494
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">using to get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the host site so</font>

495
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,950
we're tunneling it back to an hour where

496
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,770
to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get around any routing</font>

497
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:35,610
inconsistencies that we may see with

498
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:39,270
wire cast it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sends out windows media</font>

499
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:41,729
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> QuickTime feeds that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can send</font>

500

502
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,540
working to try and get native multicast

503
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,900
out of here instead of the tunnel back

504
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:55,050
to Ann Arbor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then multicast from</font>

505
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,670
there yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the question about the</font>

506
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,230
encoders are using are they were they

507

designed for IP from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ground up do</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know or there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> someone you worked</font>

509
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,549
with to do that now what we did was we

510
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:07,649
for

511
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:10,499
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Portability and functionality we</font>

512
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:12,090
started with wanting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a maintain</font>

513
00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:14,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">our laptop solution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that it's easy to</font>

514
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:16,289
take from in a room room to room and it

515
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:18,360
didn't have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct video inputs that</font>

516
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:21,509
we wanted so then we went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a small</font>

517
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:26,158
dell desktop unit and in going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

518
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:28,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and needing video input ports and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

523
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:44,159
us spec it out but we didn't actually

524
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:45,359
spec it out based on any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of specs</font>

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the</font>

partially being part to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ted's question</font>

543
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:37,408
since I was responsible i guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:39,769
first video encoding from nanog you know

00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:41,909
every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go down the road of</font>

getting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best thing that you possibly</font>

00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:47,759
can it ends up<font color="#CCCCCC"> being larger than you</font>

548
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:50,158
like and mine ended up being five feet

549
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:53,009
tall and weighing 260 kilograms and

550
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,629
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> four rackmount pcs in it so I'm</font>

551
00:26:53,009 --> 00:27:00,330
definitely sympathetic to your plight

552
00:26:54,629 --> 00:27:03,988
and yeah the optimization of encoders is

553
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:05,668
always a work in progress and right now

554
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:07,710
we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to work with the</font>

555
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:09,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">settings on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wirecast and what is</font>

556
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:13,230
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the machine to try and give</font>

557
00:27:09,749 --> 00:27:14,970
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> performance but from what</font>

558
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:17,740
we're seeing so far it may be that just

559
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:21,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">a mac mini with firewire inputs</font>

560
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:23,820
is just as good and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's size of a slice</font>

561
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:23,820
pizza so

562
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:39,440
at the last community meeting Marty had

563
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:44,510
asked about the archives so I wanted to

564
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some stats about what the hits in</font>

565
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,440
the the data transferred and the

566
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:52,040
archives from at least May through

567
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:55,700
September the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hits don't</font>

568
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:57,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">always directly correlate to Giga bytes</font>

569
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,690
transferred mainly because of if there's

570
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,280
a lot of hits for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Phillip Smith's</font>

tutorial that's an hour and a half long

572
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,660
it's a little different than a lightning

573
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,730
talk so just wanted to provide this also

574
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">I believe Larry is going to talk as well</font>

575
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:14,420
about what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the the</font>

of video archives that we have each

578
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:26,540
meeting is about 2.3 to 2.6 gig of data

579
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:29,890

585
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,690
servers that are used for the web server

00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:14,540
and mailing list and the real media

587

real media servers on shared servers

590
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:26,250
which are used also for our other

591
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:29,850
websites and mailing lists and real real

592
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:31,350
media streams in archives these these

593
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:33,899
are performed relatively well with the

594
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,040
exception of the mail server which some

595
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,660
of you have noticed from time to time

596
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,450
when there's been threads that have had

597
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:42,510
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of activity the mail server can</font>

598
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:44,429
get bogged down and did you know that

599
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:47,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">mail delivery can be delayed quite</font>

600
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:49,080
significantly so we've actually

601
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:53,490
controlling we've been going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through a</font>

602
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:55,500
technology refresh we had been a son

603
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:59,040
shop but were we've been transitioning

604
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:02,400
over to<font color="#CCCCCC"> intel based servers we've</font>

605
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,080
already got updated our web server the

606
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,620
mail server and the the real media

607
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,909
server are still running<font color="#CCCCCC"> on sun machines</font>

608
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:13,050
so but the idea what here was to try to

609
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:15,990
since the mail server in particular

610
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:19,320
tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a lot of volume to go with</font>

611
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:22,460
a separate solution for that so back at

612
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:25,800
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> toronto nana we had a meeting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

613
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:30,030
working with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the community</font>

614
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:32,639

615
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:35,520

616
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,100
servers we<font color="#E5E5E5"> was while also worked with</font>

618
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,449
these servers so it's sort of been a

619
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,820
community effort to get these machines

620
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:48,809
set up and they've helped configure them

621
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:52,200
with freebsd and install mailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font>

622
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:54,928
software and so so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here is to</font>

623
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,030
have the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have more control to</font>

624
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:59,850
have faster machines and ability to

625
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:01,950
deploy new services by working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

626
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:04,830
community to help to set up these new

627
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:07,230
services so we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one</font>

628
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,760
server that's used primarily for mailing

629
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,760
lists hosting the mailing list in

630
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition to the nanog main mailing list</font>

631
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,440
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

632
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:18,410
a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other lists for the PC and</font>

633
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,210
for engineering and Nanak support so

634
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:22,820
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be moving those two one</font>

635
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:25,430
machine and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then second machine for</font>

636
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:29,659
hosting the web server and the video

637
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:32,480
archives and also for support of the pc

638
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:34,610
and SC and then the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> here will be to</font>

639
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,250
have each server back each other up so

640
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:40,219
if one server happens to be down the

641
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:44,930
other one could potentially pick up the

642
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:46,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">the functions of the other server so</font>

643
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:49,520
briefly the mail the mail server will

644
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:51,379
run mailman and Exum for the list

645
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,920
management we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> running majordomo</font>

646
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:56,870
for a long time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's getting pretty</font>

648

number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years and mailman brings some</font>

649
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:07,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">an enhanced user interface and a lot</font>

650
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:09,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">more features so we've moved over the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Nana inch list already and are sort of</font>

652
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:14,270
experimenting with that and we'll be

653
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:19,090
moving over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other list shortly we're</font>

654
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:21,379
still looking net so for archiving email

00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:24,110
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still going to go to the</font>

server we're looking at several

658
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:31,160
different options for archival there's

659
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:34,100
been some concern about the mailman

660
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:39,560
archival function and its interface it's

661
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:41,870
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit clunky so the web server we</font>

662
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:45,260
have we're actually also redesigning the

663
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:47,360
nanog website we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a an in-house web</font>

665
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,800
job with our websites and so he's

666
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,960
redesigning that and the plan is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move</font>

667

<font color="#E5E5E5">over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the new server when he's done</font>

with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve Feldman</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done a</font>

672
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:09,170
with with Steve moving moving on we

673
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:11,899
decided would probably good to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

674
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:16,250
site over to one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two the nano</font>

675

677
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether we will amount to maintain that</font>

684
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:40,869
with the real server software or just

685
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:43,999
use HTTP to deliver the archive streams

from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web server so at this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

687
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:50,600
we're we're planning on just moving that

688
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:55,970
over to the web server and hosting that

689
00:33:50,600 --> 00:34:00,379
by HTTP that does present some issues

690
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:01,970
with seeking some of the older streams

691
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:04,100
seem to have issues with being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

692
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:05,809
seek when you use HTTP to deliver the

695
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:11,960
backwards without any problem the newer

00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:16,429
scream<font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed to be fine but the older</font>

697
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:19,089
ones seem to have some issues there's

698
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:21,020
also been some concern about the

699
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:23,599
proprietary nature of the real video

700
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:26,599
streams and whether people want to move

701
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,950
those streams to a standard format like

702
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:35,599
mp4 h.264 I did some experimentation

703
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:40,279
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> em encoder and it's supposedly can</font>

704
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:42,409
translate the the reinsert for but the

<font color="#E5E5E5">only player that could play them with</font>

to Bellevue the hosting this is a big

number if you watch any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous</font>

813
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:25,770
slides we spent a bit more in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bellevue</font>

814
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,610
and our hosting contract we had to pay

more<font color="#E5E5E5"> for our av support and we had to</font>

00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:42,090
our overhead dollars that's the portion

819
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,220
of what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community nanog has to pay</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">for just being hosted at Merritt the</font>

the cost of insurance in those kinds of

824
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:58,170
things what that netted for the Bellevue

825
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:04,560
meeting is a loss the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous slides</font>

826
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:11,790
show that for Toronto and where we had

<font color="#CCCCCC">after that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry no sir said San Jose</font>

you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're not we made</font>

progress<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Toronto we lost it on</font>

830
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:26,910
Bellevue which was the same wasn't such

831
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:30,440
a good situation in San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jose but the</font>

832
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:33,299
budget report for st. Louis was better

833
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:36,120
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ebon the flow of how the</font>

834
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:39,390
budget goes I have committed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to working</font>

835
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:41,580
with the SC to help them better

836
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:43,500
understand what some of the actual

837
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:46,200
numbers behind some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> roll-ups</font>

838
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:49,410
are so that we can do some research on

839
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,870
trending there's been a dialogue in the

840
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:54,000
SC I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spin-off of nanog</font>

841
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:55,529
futures as well to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

842
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,840
understand whether it made any

843
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:59,940
difference in terms of registration

844
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,030
numbers whether we were in big cities or

845
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,520
small cities or whether it was a direct

846
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:07,230
flight or not that affected the

847
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,230
registration numbers so those are the

848

make sure that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> improve on the</font>

850
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:18,030
bottom line my observation to all of you

851
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,770
is the issue isn't necessarily whether

852
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:21,450
we have three meetings or two meetings a

853
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:25,560
year the issue really

854
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:28,770
is how can we improve the attendance at

855
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:32,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the meetings and whether there's any</font>

856
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:33,990
better sponsorship formula than the one

857
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:37,049
we've been using for a very long time

858
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:39,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">Beering gear and break sponsors are a</font>

859
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:40,710
big piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the revenue stream and do</font>

860
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:43,560
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it right do we have the</font>

861
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:46,440
registration model right based on

862
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:48,480
content and program agenda and location

863
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:52,980
and do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the sponsorship number</font>

864
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:54,960
right my boss and my support staff back

865
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:57,930
in Ann Arbor don't like to see these red

866
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,510
numbers any more than you do no one

867
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:02,640
wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay more for registration but</font>

868
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:04,349
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important that the SC</font>

869
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,259
work with merit and that we try to

870
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:08,940
better understand these trends so that

871
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:12,450
we go in the right direction that we all

872
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:14,460
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to but in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sake and in</font>

895
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:17,910
the right direction that I can confirm

896
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:20,160
right now that nanog 42 is going to be

903
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:40,910
I get a contract in place I don't want

904
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:43,190
to name the host and or the location but

905
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:44,450
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you all may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font>

907
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:49,089
brooklyn new york which would be very

exciting<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we could make this happen we</font>

910
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:59,839
to New York so it was very exciting when

911
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:02,990
this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dropped in that we could go</font>

912
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:04,849
to a location we haven't been to I think

913
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:08,779
it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great to get back to the east</font>

914
00:45:04,849 --> 00:45:11,180
coast but as always for those who<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:14,119
posted nanog before getting a hotel

916
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:17,020
contract work out isn't always as easy

917
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:20,359
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sounds takes a little bit of time</font>

918
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:22,759
we're also working on a contract for

919

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hotel contract and an</font>

924
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:37,578
did run into some roadblocks before this

925
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:40,129
meeting we simply ran out of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">work on those issues the date that I</font>

927
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:45,410
think we're pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much locked into</font>

928
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:47,690
regardless of venue is October twelfth

929
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,368
through the 14th just because of other

930
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:52,279
meetings that we're going to collide

931
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:54,559
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so whether we go to the</font>

00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:02,660
the date that we all agreed both at

will<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually begin to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start talking</font>

940
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:17,299
about februari the good news<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

941
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:20,270
through this meeting here already and

942
00:46:17,299 --> 00:46:25,009
through my email last week we may

943
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:28,099
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a host for februari of 09</font>

944
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:32,150
jun of 09 and with some discussions

945
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:36,579
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> October</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of 09 so really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> positive</font>

946
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:36,579
things giving security to dates

947
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:43,060
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's it for me I'm</font>

948
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:50,380
certainly here can take questions now I

949
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:52,450
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions now my question is a</font>

950
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:54,790
couple of meetings ago we talked about

951
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:56,230
walking in the same venue for multi

952
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:58,000
years whatever happened with that I

953
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:00,790
tried really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard we had talked about</font>

954
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting Chicago it was something I think</font>

955
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:05,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">I talked about in the PC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the SC</font>

956
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:08,740
problem when I started looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

957
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:10,660
Chicago was the cost of hotel rooms we

958
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:13,240
heard loud<font color="#E5E5E5"> and clear the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SE did as well</font>

959
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:15,879
as merit that there was a sensitivity to

960
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:18,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">room rates how much all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

961
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:21,280
feel you could get approval at your

962
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:24,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">company's for and trying to lock in</font>

963
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,870
chicago in june with the kind of space

964
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:29,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we needed with the room rate that</font>

965
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:33,580
we were going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay was darn near</font>

966
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:35,800
impossible are we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was still</font>

967
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:39,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at other locations like that but</font>

968
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:41,590
still multi-year deals absolutely my

969
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,680
goal truthfully right now was to get

970
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:47,500
some locked in so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we could change</font>

971
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:49,359
the trend and then work on changing the

972
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:52,510
trend<font color="#E5E5E5"> or getting multiple year or</font>

973
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:55,180
locations the problem with the same

974
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:58,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">location or multiple years is we also</font>

975
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:00,850
need a host in that location to commit

976
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:04,480
to being a host for multiple years so

977
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:06,190
it's one thing to get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> location and get</font>

978
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,130
a good hotel rate but then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to</font>

979
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:10,660
have a host that's willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide</font>

980
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:12,700
transit and doing all the other things

00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,379
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> host do for us for those multiple</font>

982
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:17,230
years so it's a it's a little bit more

983
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:20,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Toronto my February's seem to be</font>

00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:21,220
very popular it was love this well and

985
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:23,590
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually part of my question</font>

986
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:25,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what's interesting about the numbers</font>

987
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:28,330
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you present is that the locations</font>

1002
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:05,868
we looked at the expense<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said to dad</font>

yeah let's take<font color="#CCCCCC"> life let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a risk</font>

1004
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:11,839
on it because it's in a popular location

1005
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:13,339
we think we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of walk ins and</font>

1006
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:16,460
we should have a high registration

number to make up the gap we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1008
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:23,869
so it's a trend it's something we have

00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:26,119
to look at and if you recall after st.

00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:31,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know if it made it into nano on</font>

1013
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:34,130
futures but there was certainly a lot of

1014
00:49:31,369 --> 00:49:37,759
discussion on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nano guess see about</font>

1015
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:42,529
Albuquerque and last time I checked we

1016
00:49:37,759 --> 00:49:44,450
had 40 437 registrants here this may not

1017
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:47,059
be a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you but related to</font>

1018
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:49,819
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> santo domingo idea was floated and</font>

1019
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:51,440
went away and the SC decided we weren't

1020
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:53,839
going to do that is that so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1021
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,089
booking all the stuff out really far

1022
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:58,999
into the future I thought that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1023
00:49:56,089 --> 00:50:01,069
fantastic idea and it I think it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1024
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:02,629
shame to not make space for that figure

1025
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:04,609
out a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that happen absolutely</font>

1026
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:07,430
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned to</font>

1027
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:10,759
the SC is since we have October lined up

1028
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:13,669
we have to revisit this issue about

1029
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:17,029
februari before we go forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make</font>

1030
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:18,829
too much I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think too much commitment to</font>

00:50:17,029 --> 00:50:21,470
our host or get a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

1032
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:23,180
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have to look at all the</font>

1033
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:25,009
other organizations that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:28,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">the conversation with that we didn't</font>

1035
00:50:25,009 --> 00:50:31,519
have in the last round of that

1036
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:32,899
discussion bed yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know one of the</font>

1037
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:35,749
things we had talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in the past</font>

1038
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:38,299
have been the price of the hotel rooms

1039
00:50:35,749 --> 00:50:40,578
that everyone in this room would have to

1040
00:50:38,299 --> 00:50:42,829
bear and you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some of these</font>

1041
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:44,779
places<font color="#E5E5E5"> like New York City I know you</font>

1042
00:50:42,829 --> 00:50:46,579
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of get a kind of an idea</font>

1043
00:50:44,779 --> 00:50:48,980
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> community is two hundred</font>

1044
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:51,349
dollars per night the maximum people

1045
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:53,539
would be willing to spend or is it now

1046
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:57,079
225 because last time we asked was like

1047
00:50:53,539 --> 00:50:59,119
two or three years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was 159 so no</font>

1048
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:01,180
good question though this may be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

1049
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">forum to have that survey anyone asked</font>

1050
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:08,060
absolutely

1051
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:09,700
um there you go put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up tell me tell</font>

1052
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">us on the survey what you think</font>

1053
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:16,129
absolutely tell us what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think your</font>

00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:19,130
maximum hotel rate can be because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1055
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:20,540
important we if we it's important it's

1056
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:25,070
just really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we don't know</font>

1057
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:27,350
if you don't tell us just a tax by the

1058
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:28,640
microphone just a brief<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on</font>

1059
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,650
Toronto the Toronto numbers were

1060
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,029
reasonable they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the black and I</font>

1061
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:33,520
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the big reasons for that is</font>

1062
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:35,540
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time in Toronto</font>

1063
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:38,119
getting local people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to the</font>

1064
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:39,590
meeting and we spent probably a probably

1065
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:41,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">a month and a half two months beforehand</font>

1066
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:42,200
just calling people and trying to

1067
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:43,970
convince them they should pay their

1068
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,790
staff pay for their staff to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to nanog</font>

1069
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:48,680
and I think in some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the locations I</font>

1070
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:50,390
think we sometimes take that for granted

1071
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,730
that the local community will do that on

1072
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:54,500
their own and I think people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

1073
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:55,850
regular nanog attendees should really

1074
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,320
take some of the responsibility for that

1075
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:58,730
and trying to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting</font>

1076
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,410
successful by getting people in their

1077
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:03,740
towns when when there are meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:05,750
local to sign up and come I agree with

1079
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:08,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">you that made a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huge difference in</font>

Toronto and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've also i'm not picking on</font>

fact of information we have 436 again

consider putting it on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> East Coast so</font>

1090
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,230
that it's easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> for those who are</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that the issue ran with October is when</font>

Rodney Jaffe asked if he could host

1095

nanog in California given the

1096

significance of the year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount</font>

that Rodney has done for Nana we kind of

1098
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:03,950
said yes absolutely can we ask him<font color="#E5E5E5"> if he</font>

rate i'm willing to pay does actually

1108
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:33,859
vary a little bit depending on how long

1109
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:36,890
i have to be here in since i have to be

here and also you know in terms of what

1115
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:54,470
it ends up costing my company absolutely

1116
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:57,020
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the the community nature</font>

1117
00:53:54,470 --> 00:54:00,080
of nanog one size doesn't fit all of us

1118

have to deal with and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's the ebb</font>

1120
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,520
and the flow of some of this once you

1121
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">just do a quick straw poll here right</font>

deal yes always but it truly is setting

1131
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:54,109
an artificial ceiling gonna paint you in

1132

the corner that you can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

1133
00:54:54,109 --> 00:55:01,640
it's tough and it will it will if we

1134
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:07,339
find ourselves in a situation where our

1135
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:10,069
ceiling is 179 it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be really</font>

1136
00:55:07,339 --> 00:55:12,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">really hard to find locations where you</font>

no why<font color="#CCCCCC"> are no sorry our information</font>

1143
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:33,590
rather than a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question next year's fall</font>

1144
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:35,960
right meeting is not back to back with

1145
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:39,530
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nano gandarium meeting there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

1146
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:42,470
clear week between the two so that's

1147
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:46,750
from the 26 to the 30th and also it will

1148
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:46,750
not be an Amsterdam it will be in Dubai

1149
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:54,500
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> as far as the room rate it might be</font>

1150
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:57,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">smart to put on the survey is it the /</font>

1151
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,850
nitrate that matters is it the total

1152
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:01,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost over the length of the meeting and</font>

1153
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:03,650
also does the is an airfare<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus room</font>

1154
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:05,720
rate but as far as the straw poll goals

1155
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:08,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would highly recommend that you pull</font>

1156
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:12,430
the people who couldn't make it rather

1157
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:14,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">than people who did yeah in general but</font>

1158
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:16,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm just saying pull the people who</font>

1159
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:19,399
couldn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it maybe it's the dates</font>

1160
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:24,379
the airfare find out why<font color="#CCCCCC"> they couldn't</font>

1161
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:26,330
just a quick idea is it possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1162
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:29,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel reservations to have an</font>

1163
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:32,420
earlier rate so if you commit two months

1164
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,680
prior to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the event get a cheaper rate at</font>

1165
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hotel I don't know if the hotels are</font>

1166
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,700
open to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that not generally just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1167
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:40,610
everyone knows the way our hotel

1168
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:43,460
contracts work the way we try to make

1169
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:45,460
our hotel contracts work is that we

1170
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:49,010
booked room nights at certain rates

1171
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:51,710
which are the public rates that you all

1172
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:54,740
pay and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the large room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> black</font>

1173
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:57,140
they generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> will let us have meeting</font>

1174
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:59,290
space for free that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of</font>

1175
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:02,120
deal that we're always getting now

1176
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:04,490
hotels want room rental in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1177
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:06,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">room blacks so it's becoming much more</font>

1178
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:08,390
aggressive and difficult and it doesn't

1179
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:11,720
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether we booked a year in</font>

1180
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:14,180
advance for those room box or a month

1181
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:16,390
before they don't move too<font color="#CCCCCC"> much on the</font>

1182
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,390
rates

1183
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:29,750
okay thanks everyone look we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not done</font>

1184
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:31,640
actually I have a question huh I I have

1185
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:34,400
a straw poll that I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

1186
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:37,310
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room however it is likely to</font>

1187
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,870
devolve into finger-pointing and

1188
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:40,430
significantly derail<font color="#CCCCCC"> occurring</font>

1189
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:42,440
conversations I want to make sure the

1190
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:45,440
current conversation is over before I

1191
00:57:42,440 --> 00:58:02,570
got good I'm done so I'll turn it over

1192
00:57:45,440 --> 00:58:06,800
to Joe I'm waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the chicken for</font>

1193
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:17,300
the chair to please proceed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1194
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:19,010
straw poll so just just before you

1195
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:23,590
mentioned what the straw polls about are

1196
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:23,590
you are you imagining a show of hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1197
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:31,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah yeah I'm actually because you</font>

1198
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:38,270
have bits of paper in your hand too so

1199
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:39,620
I'm bit confused yeah I'm it is it does

1200
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:41,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">not have a list of names you stop</font>

1201
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:43,700
varying the distance from the life and I

1202
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:46,100
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop moving the slider so okay it</font>

1203
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:48,560
does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have listed names on i'm</font>

1204
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:50,060
not writing down anybody's names<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

1205
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:52,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to collar people who had their</font>

1206
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:55,130
hands up later although i might send out

1207
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:56,420
mail and say hey how<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you get behind</font>

1208
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:58,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">this if he said that you were behind</font>

1209
00:58:56,420 --> 00:59:03,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">this but um it's come to my attention</font>

1210
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:06,649
recently because of recent events that

1211
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:10,810
they're the reasons that the SC can

1212
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:13,730
remove somebody from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SC as a</font>

1213
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:16,430
self-policing sort of way it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1214
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:19,480
very narrowly scoped it's for

1215
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:24,290
non-participation that's pretty much it

1216
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:26,810
for things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like conduct unbecoming or</font>

1217
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:32,470
being deliberately disruptive or

1218
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:37,160
or whatever the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SC really has no</font>

1219
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:39,230
ability to the audits that's codified to

1220
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:45,290
deal with that and I see Betty stepping

1221
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:49,240
up there so I'm hope and so section 6.7

1222
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:53,600
actually in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter actually</font>

1223
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:56,870
actually addresses this and I was hoping

1224
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:59,779
to see a show of hands for people who

1225
00:59:56,870 --> 01:00:02,240
would be willing to support or think

1226
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:07,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that might be generally a good idea to</font>

1227
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:10,220
delete the language insect 67 that

1228
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:12,410
restricts the reasons that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SC can</font>

1229
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:15,259
police its own with the understanding

1230
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:19,690
that you need a supermajority to to take

1231
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:23,420
action against anybody for misbehavior

1232
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:25,850
so okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's the question on the</font>

1233
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:28,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">table is who thinks that this might be a</font>

1234
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:30,410
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea so without having the text on</font>

1235
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:31,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the screen is somewhat difficult to</font>

1236
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:34,850
comment on but the general the general

1237
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:38,240
proposal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the SC be given the</font>

1238
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:40,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">power to eject somebody else sitting SC</font>

1239
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:43,430
member for whatever reason they see fit

1240
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:45,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">but by a supermajority without without</font>

1241
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:48,500
scoping it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as to the reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

1242
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:50,150
can do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so and you're asking for</font>

1243
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:54,620
a show of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 'king for a show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1244
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:57,860
hands at this time yes so who would be

1245
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:59,240
in favor of such a proposal in general

1246
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:04,060
given that it's not written<font color="#E5E5E5"> down in</font>

1247
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:04,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">boolean in legal type of text</font>

1248
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:12,580
yeah okay well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll fill can you turn</font>

1249
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:13,720
the projector back on for say did

1250
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:16,840
anybody just count the number of hands

1251
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:19,089
that were raised I III didn't count the

1252
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:21,940
number about I'll I'll take the time to

1253
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:23,260
actually write it up based on but based

1254
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:24,820
on level support that I've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1255
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:29,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll run it up the flagpole and futures</font>

1256
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:36,280
and see what we can get okay yeah can we

1257
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:38,620
see people opposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I saw a</font>

1258
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:43,450
few more than six hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> in we had better</font>

1259
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:45,609
than 2.7% participation so in terms of

1260
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:47,859
process as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned before if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1261
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:50,380
is another proposal to amend the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter</font>

1262
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:52,210
at this meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't think that it</font>

1263
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,530
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready by the bad guys meeting I</font>

1264
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:54,760
think it's something they can avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1265
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:56,890
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how the mechanics of that</font>

1266
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,870
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> work that's yeah yeah III don't</font>

1267
01:01:56,890 --> 01:02:00,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to upset the apple</font>

1268
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:02,259
cart okay so this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a proposal</font>

1269
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:04,390
that you people who are interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1270
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:06,730
might get together and put<font color="#E5E5E5"> that port for</font>

1271
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:07,870
next October's meeting yes which is the

1272
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:14,080
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity to change the Charter</font>

1273
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:16,330
okay okay Thank You Keith um just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font>

1274
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to comment on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the reason that I</font>

1275
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:19,569
didn't stick my hand up to either option

1276
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:22,240
as I find it very difficult to do so

1277
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:23,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a rationale for the change so a</font>

1278
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,209
request if this is coming back as a

1279
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:28,990
proposal we need some accompanying

1280
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:31,450
rationale I yeah I think RS was being

1281
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:33,189
diplomatic in not spelling out any

1282
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:34,810
particular recent events that he think

1283
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:37,420
might be you there's like this policy

1284
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:38,890
might be useful for but yeah I'm sure if

1285
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,180
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go and talk to RS in the bar</font>

1286
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:44,830
afterwards he'll he'll give us for

1287
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:46,750
reasoning yeah Jolie<font color="#CCCCCC"> ugly um I don't</font>

1288
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:48,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there is any particular reason why</font>

1289
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:50,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Charter should scope potentially</font>

1290
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:52,680
revolutionary activities I don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1291
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:55,510
charter in fact I would prefer to

1292
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:57,549
explicitly like throw it down when i get

1293
01:02:55,510 --> 01:03:00,100
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where i wish to engage in</font>

1294
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:01,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">that sort of activity and obviously that</font>

1295
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:06,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">has happened before in this organization</font>

1296
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:08,350
and in many others so I'm not

1297
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:11,740
philosophically opposed to this policy

1298
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:12,490
proposal I might even consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but I</font>

1299
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:15,910
wouldn't

1300
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:22,600
actually consider it scoping the limits

1301
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:23,980
of my activity I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> RS for me the the</font>

1302
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">greatest concern I have about something</font>

1303
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:28,060
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this would be that you're taking</font>

1304
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:31,869
the will of a very large group of people

1305
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:35,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">and reducing that by the will of a</font>

1306
01:03:31,869 --> 01:03:36,940
smaller subset of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're</font>

1307
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:39,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have to really have something</font>

1308
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:42,880
bad happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to exercise</font>

1309
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:45,730
that specific thing and I wonder if such

1310
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,140
a specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing might be so rare and</font>

1311
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:51,600
unlikely to happen in the future that

1312
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:51,600
it's not worth codifying in the Charter

1313
01:03:54,150 --> 01:04:00,369
Randy Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> bush i J it won't be rare</font>

1314
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:04,570
because you stuck with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me for another</font>

1315
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:07,360
year let's get truthful here he doesn't

1316
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:09,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">think I act properly as an sc member I'm</font>

1317
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:14,230
intentionally provocative I say what I

1318
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:19,810
think and I mean it enough people<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask me</font>

1319
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:22,180
to resign I'll resign right now oh but I

1320
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:25,090
agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> his proposal as what I've</font>

1321
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:29,259
heard it less restrictions less rules

1322
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:30,550
less garbage that's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's in</font>

1323
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:31,720
keeping with other proposals we've made

1324
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:34,750
to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Charter recently as well</font>

1325
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:43,419
so Randy were you formally asking for a

1326
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:48,090
straw poll does anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else have</font>

1327
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:52,050
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say at all about anything</font>

1328
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:52,050
dinner there we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1329
01:04:53,940 --> 01:05:00,180
oh that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right candidates who have put</font>

1330
01:04:56,250 --> 01:05:02,550
their name forward for the SC would any

1331
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:04,560
of you like time at the microphone just

1332
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:06,569
to introduce yourself and to let people

1333
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:08,430
know what you think about things just

1334
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:11,099
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> briefly a couple minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each or</font>

1335
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:11,879
not if you choose not to I realized I

1336
01:05:11,099 --> 01:05:13,260
should have mentioned this at the

1337
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:17,280
beginning so you had time mentally to

1338
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:18,960
prepare<font color="#CCCCCC"> if sorry better anybody who's</font>

1339
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:22,170
currently standing for the SC who would

1340
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say something or stand up and</font>

1341
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:25,230
just speak from where you are or come to

1342
01:05:23,369 --> 01:05:27,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mic so the remote participants can</font>

1343
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:32,480
see this is being webcast right yeah

1344
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:34,500
nope<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well everybody has name badges</font>

1345
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:36,089
everybody who's standing for the SC i

1346
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,530
think has been 25 or more meetings and

1347
01:05:36,089 --> 01:05:39,900
therefore their signature is intensely

1348
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:42,180
valuable so anybody who doesn't know

1349
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:43,680
them i recommend you you find them in

1350
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:46,020
the bar or elsewhere in the corridors

1351
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:50,089
and and ask them what they think about

1352
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:52,500
the issues that are important to you and

1353
01:05:50,089 --> 01:05:55,490
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community meeting is now</font>
