1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,548
good morning my name is Vince fuller

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,200
this is a short presentation that came

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,120
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a conversation that a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,879
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple months ago during a meeting</font>

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,639
those of you the gray hairs and the no

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,800
hairs among you may recognize the mid

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,049
80s movie reference the rest of you

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably have no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea why all the author</font>

9
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:26,580
names are John so what's this all about

10
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:29,039
240 / 4 is a chunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of address space that</font>

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">was originally and still is defined as</font>

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,239
reserved for future use it's basically

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,469
one sixteenth of the total address space

14
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,870
or six point two five percent that's set

15
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,239
aside for a few treats well given that

16
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,500
the ipv4 address space is running down

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,379
well maybe it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:52,920
considering using that which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> reserved</font>

19
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:56,160
for the future okay I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,870
was funny but uh so yeah basically the

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,038
title of talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the future</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now so</font>

22
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,140
there are several different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,789
could go<font color="#CCCCCC"> about using this space the</font>

24
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,099
first is obviously throw it into the

25
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">public use pool which makes it</font>

26
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,059
potentially available sometime in the

27
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,860
future<font color="#CCCCCC"> for general use of course since</font>

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,380
implementations need to be modified to

29
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,780
accept these addresses that's not

30
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,060
something that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do tomorrow</font>

31
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,470
second option is make this space you

32
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,509
know private use address space just like

33
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,150
another chunk of RFC fifth nineteen

34
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,909
eighteen space that's what draft Wilson

35
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,110
class EO one talks about Jeff Houston is

36
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,140
one of the co-authors he can answer

37
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:34,229
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that or you could split</font>

38
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,509
the space up between those two uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

39
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,829
find some other<font color="#E5E5E5"> special use for it or</font>

40
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:39,930
you can do nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is basically</font>

41
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we've been doing now what we seem</font>

42
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,180
to do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of in the internet industry</font>

43
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,920
the approach that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> authors took after</font>

44
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,560
some argument there's actually some

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,960
people in our little group that argued

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,030
very vociferously for making a private

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,339
use some that argued that no you can't

48
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,990
do that some that invoked all sorts of

49
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,140
economics arguments on how you should

50
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know make this a commodity or set</font>

51
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,130
the price on or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever but with the</font>

52
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,350
one thing we could agree on is that we

53
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,269
don't you know we agreed to disagree but

54
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,919
it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably be a good idea to make it</font>

55
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,080
possible to use this space sometime in

56
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,140
the future

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,240
and the approach that meets all of our

58
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">interests was simply to make the</font>

59
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,370
modifications to implementations to

60
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,080
allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> this space to be used and then let</font>

61
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,180
the community decide over the next year

62
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,210
or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> years whatever how they want to</font>

63
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,520
allocate it and so let's do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it let's</font>

64
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,740
make the code changes its act the code

65
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,960
changes are actually very simple

66
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,160
basically five line five different files

67
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,460
and be modified on a Linux

68
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,160
implementation a couple lines each the

69
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,780
spec is about five pages long including

70
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the IETF boilerplate so there's</font>

71
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:50,150
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> only about 22 pages of actual</font>

72
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">text feel free to read it as I said</font>

73
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,110
there is some running code I did some

74
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:59,269
changes to Linux to make it make it work

75
00:02:54,110 --> 00:03:00,590
both<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> legs what the two the two</font>

76
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">different types of kernels one that's</font>

77
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,330
running on the link<font color="#E5E5E5"> six boxes and one</font>

78
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's running current</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lenox again five</font>

79
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,480
files from moving a few lines each

80
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,620
basically one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the files they don't</font>

81
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">even really have to modify its a</font>

82
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,260
definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> style you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could easily come</font>

83
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with a binary patch for this dino my</font>

84
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,670
colleague has on the list test platform

85
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,500
which would make her a little more about

<font color="#E5E5E5">later in the day has actually done</font>

87
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,940
similar changes there again the changes

88
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,829
are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple took maybe an hour to</font>

89
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,890
code and actually and test<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get</font>

90
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:35,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">working turns out that freebsd actually</font>

91
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:40,040
already supports use of 240 / for

92
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:42,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">unexpected office is actually acting as</font>

93
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,579
a router it won't forward something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

94
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,920
uses these addresses it considers the

95
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,840
Martians for boarding but it's happy to

96
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,329
let you configure them as interface

97
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,700
addresses and use them as a host as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

98
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:55,100
understand it OS<font color="#E5E5E5"> X is based on freebsd</font>

99
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,470
so it should work and some testing that

100
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:01,120
we've done indicates that it does accept

101
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:03,709
240 /<font color="#E5E5E5"> for dresses quite handily</font>

102
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,010
obviously this doesn't talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

107
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,529
this in the field it's not something you

108
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:20,298
could turn on tomorrow but the sooner we

109
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:21,679
get the code changed the sooner people

110
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:24,679
might be able to start using it

111
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,240
future that's it there any questions

112
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,259
I'll be happy to take them any comments

113
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,229
0 ha I'll be happy to take those two

114

brand new record Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bush Raj Randy</font>

115
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:40,430
yes um just want to underscore a lesson

116
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:45,410
here yep don't hardcored code address

117
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:49,449
crap in routers hosts etc look at that

118
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:53,449
for v6 please ula all this nonsense

119
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:58,699
don't do it that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a good</font>

120
00:04:53,449 --> 00:05:01,940
advice anyone else without<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question</font>

121
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:06,710
are you just walking up the hall<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

122
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:08,870
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll wait i'm rob c strim and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

one of the collaborators on draft wilson

124
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:15,320
sure mom we kicked this back<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

125
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:17,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably as much as you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys did and in</font>

126
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,680
view of the fact that i very recently

127
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,870
run an edge dsl network where you had to

128
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,840
strenuously avoid octet last octet 0

129
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:29,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">over last octet 255 to deal with</font>

130
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,400
obsolete<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft crud that's it decade</font>

131
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,849
or moral that's still out there in the

132
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,280
field I believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

133
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:40,070
serious chance of big operational

134
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,780
troubles for our call centers and stuff

135
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,400
like that if this sort of thing goes out

136
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,760
becomes public as opposed to private

137
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,760
address space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually I actually</font>

138
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,699
would agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you however in fact</font>

139
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,960
this draft is agnostic on whether it

140
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:55,340
should be public or private it's just

141
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,388
saying let's make the code changes I

142
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,219
think that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really good</font>

143
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,889
argument for<font color="#E5E5E5"> only using these addresses</font>

144
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,810
in a new new build or at a private

145
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:04,340
network will you control all the ends in

146
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,650
systems and you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry</font>

147
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,690
about legacy junk out there we also

148
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,340
talked back and forth about just how how

149
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,280
