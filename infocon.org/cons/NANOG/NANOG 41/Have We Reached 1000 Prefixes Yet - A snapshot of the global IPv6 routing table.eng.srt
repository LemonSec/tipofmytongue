00:00:01,429 --> 00:00:10,980
howdy that's what we say and on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">ranch where I live um this isn't my work</font>

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,849
so but I'm presenting it because I

4
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,130
always think that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,690
interesting and I think this audience

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,310
and a lot of other audiences don't get

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,990
to see it because unless you go to a

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,570
right meeting you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,009
and those of you are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the next</font>

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,840
right meeting which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is next week</font>

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,369
there'll be a much better presentation

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,019
of this by the person<font color="#CCCCCC"> who actually did</font>

13
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,019
the work there so you can tune me up

14
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,489
anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit</font>

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,820
about though you know the trends in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

16
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:44,099
v6 routing table the six bones gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> yay</font>

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,780
um some and some other really

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,620
interesting routing table things that

19
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,079
that Garrett has found doing this work

20
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:55,288
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the typical up when to the</font>

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,879
right graph for v6 and you know I hate

22
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give the punchline now but we haven't</font>

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,519
reached a thousand prefixes yet and you

24
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,349
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the little dip or the six bone</font>

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:10,020
went away and there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more slides</font>

26
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:13,408
on that this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR prefix</font>

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,259
assignments and the v6 ones as they show

28
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,200
up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table and as you can see on</font>

29
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:21,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">6606 the six bone pretty much one away</font>

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:26,670
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> as plan things happened as</font>

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:29,430
planned this is just the last six<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

32
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:35,070
it's been pretty steady growth but still

33
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:41,040
pretty pretty slow and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this is the</font>

34
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:43,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bone going away that yeah the the</font>

35
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,530
six bone went away there's still one

36
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,809
prefix showing up in the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a</font>

37
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,780
lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevalent the last time I</font>

38
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,240
presented this it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> only from</font>

39
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">one a s that Garrett has views and you</font>

40
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,420
can still see this advertisement and

41
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,509
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really sure if that's a ghost</font>

42
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,100
thing or if a s<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4555 is still</font>

43
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,020
originating the route but it doesn't

44
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,649
really look like they are because he

45
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,769
can't see it from his a s for those of

46
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">you who do filter in doodoo v6 stop</font>

47
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,620
listening to three ffe because it's

48
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">really not supposed to</font>

49
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:22,230
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used until a registry decides that it</font>

50
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:24,870
is it's gone away let's see for the last

51
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,268
24 months the little blip<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big huge</font>

52
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,459
blip is some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more specifics that got</font>

53
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:32,459
injected by accident that seems to

54
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:34,170
happen every once in a while there was

55
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">also this ghost issue that I'll talk</font>

56
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,268
about later that still seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be going</font>

57
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,458
on and I've been presenting this for

58
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:43,260
Garrett probably for five or six years

59
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">now and the ghosting problem still</font>

60
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:50,730
hasn't gone away it's pretty scary and

61
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:53,660
then this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is per region as you can see</font>

62
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:57,328
the little blip was within<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron space</font>

63
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,859
and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the distribution of in</font>

64
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:00,359
the routing this is actually what's in

65
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:04,940
the routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> table so the number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

66
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:09,450
routes but per region / I our space

67
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:12,150
let's see and then by country and the

68
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,909
ripe region since this is a presentation

69
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,890
for specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the ripe region and</font>

70
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:19,290
the you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information is a little</font>

71
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,970
bit more distributed there than as

72
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,400
you'll see it is in the northern North

73
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,250
America this is the breakdown<font color="#CCCCCC"> per region</font>

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the most the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most routes in the</font>

75
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:32,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">routing table from a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> country is at the</font>

76
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:36,180
top and black and then there's some

77
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,340
great britain in the middle and across

78
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,440
and that's broken down by a month and

79
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:46,340
year and then within our region there

80
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">really isn't a whole lot of distribution</font>

81
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,239
as he says it's less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting but</font>

82
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,129
he made<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slide for me anyway so</font>

83
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,739
everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else down in the noise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

84
00:03:53,129 --> 00:04:00,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">US is up at the top with the big blip</font>

85
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:03,660
from the more specifics let's see so

86
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,489
some interesting numbers there's 798

87
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">unique a s is visible in the routing</font>

88
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:10,290
table and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way this is</font>

89
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,870
broken<font color="#CCCCCC"> down that was on 10 4 2007 the</font>

90
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:17,219
last measurement was 720 which was in

91
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:19,470
May<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 2007 there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five hundred and</font>

92
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">fifty two that are origin only and they</font>

93
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:25,380
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give transit and then there are</font>

94
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:27,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">211 a esas that give transit and then</font>

95
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,250
there are some that are transit only

96
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll talk a little bit about more about</font>

97
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,860
one of those later there appear to be no

98
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,630
a SS originating at least except for

99
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,560
that weird ghost problem the six bone

100
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:43,050
prefixes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then there's a bunch that</font>

101
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,850
just originated one rir prefix which is

102
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:49,620
really maybe aggregation will work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

103
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:52,320
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> 14 a esas that have more than</font>

104
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,930
six prefixes and then there are some

105
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,780
pre-fit guess is that still advertise

106
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,180
this last 32 and the / 35 because the

107
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,330
original minimum allocation was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a / 35</font>

108
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,460
and then everybody got bumped up if they

109
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:08,400
wanted to to a 32 and some people still

110
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:14,099
advertise both and this is all observed

111
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:16,409
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> garett</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say s 55-39 so yeah this is</font>

112
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:19,950
the two prefixes the two announcements

113
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:23,100
for the 32 and the 35 there's exchange

114
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:27,419
prefixes being advertised / for

115
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:29,810
individual / 48 there are also quite a

116
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:34,580
few p I blocks being advertised and

117
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,580
assigned by the registries there / 48

118
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,660
this is a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting thing I</font>

119
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,320
actually didn't know that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

120
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,479
using 32 byte bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs yet but it looks</font>

121
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,330
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are several v6 networks that</font>

122
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:52,469
are advertising a 32-bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs and they</font>

123
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:54,390
show up as 3.7 and 2.3<font color="#CCCCCC"> and 6.3 and then</font>

124
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,020
if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the right software the</font>

125
00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:01,260
trends the you show up as<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 3 4 5</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6</font>

126
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,820
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the transition plan for</font>

127
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:08,130
important you know the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

128
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:10,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">sized ASNs this is the graph okay let me</font>

129
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the x axis is the</font>

130
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,650
prefix length so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's large 16 / 20 / 24</font>

131
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,919
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> y axis is the number of prefixes</font>

132
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:24,030
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table and the the blue bar was a</font>

133
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:27,150
measurement on 10 a 10 206 the green

134
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:29,369
bars and measurement on 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 07 and then</font>

135
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,469
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> skinny skinny bar is the</font>

136
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:35,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">variation so like if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the /</font>

137
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:39,150
24 s there were<font color="#E5E5E5"> three on the on the 10</font>

138
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">20 6 but the in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> routing table it was</font>

139
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,779
up to 40

140
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:45,209
at one point during the year so that's

141
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:46,949
what this graph is about so it he's

142
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:48,629
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a better better way</font>

143
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:53,489
to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> the variation so if you have any</font>

144
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:57,959
ideas let us know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

145

146
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:04,259
there were 921 prefixes and this is the

147
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:07,319
breakdown / rir so most of the

148
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:09,599
advertisements<font color="#CCCCCC"> are /</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 32</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s there are a</font>

150
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:17,779
there are a few super<font color="#E5E5E5"> super short</font>

151
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:20,609
prefixes and certainly a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

152
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:22,649
ripe and AP Nick and Aaron then lack

154
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:32,909
is have to figure that one out so there

155
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:36,558
were this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breakdown of allocations</font>

156
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:38,909
by our IRS and if you look at the the

157
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:40,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">individual rirs and you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

158
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:42,869
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many total members they have it</font>

159
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:44,819
seems like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know ripe has so much</font>

160
00:07:42,869 --> 00:07:47,159
more but as a percentage of members

161
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,869
they're all kind of about the same well

162
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:52,498
except he doesn't have good numbers for

163
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:55,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">AfriNIC and from the imagine early</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

167
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:06,058
gone up ten percent let's see and this

168
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:07,888
is an only forty-eight percent of the

169
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:09,089
allocations are visible<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the routing</font>

discouraging this graph on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> x-axis is</font>

172
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:22,109
the year that the allocations were

00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:24,299
allocated so the the tote the solid box

00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:27,599
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that year is the allocations for</font>

175
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:29,878
that year and then the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> colored boxes</font>

176
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,589
for each year or which of those showed

177
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,129
up in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> routing table on each one of</font>

178
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:38,789
these measurement dates so in 2003 there

179
00:08:35,129 --> 00:08:41,999
were it's like 225 allocations and if

180
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:44,068
you look at each subsequent year<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nadia</font>

181
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:47,249
just a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> over half show up in any</font>

182
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:49,649
given year which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty consistent it</font>

183
00:08:47,249 --> 00:08:53,610
looks like it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot worse than well</font>

184
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:54,240
2007 isn't done 2006 not a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

185
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,970
showed up

186
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,970
there are some asians in the data where

187
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:02,459
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> if to li li ours merge in the ripe</font>

188
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,610
region they reset the allocation date

189
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:07,770
but for the most part this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

190
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,240
distribution of when they're allocated

191
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:15,209
in what years they show up in the

192
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:16,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">routing table</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so these are the</font>

193
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:18,479
different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of allocations in a</font>

194
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,970
region and which ones how many of them

195
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,470
show up in the writing table I think

196
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's interesting that only half of</font>

197
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,690
the critical infrastructure shows up in

198
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,709
the routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> table that's critical</font>

199
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:32,750
wouldn't it show up in the routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> table</font>

200
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:35,760
but um this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the breakdown of that so</font>

201
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,140
but in our exchange point blocks not

202
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,790
very many of them are showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in the</font>

203
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:44,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">air in region one of them in AP Nick so</font>

204
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,170
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the breakdown of those looks like</font>

205
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:51,480
there's quite a few p I assignments in

206
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:53,520
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron region 92 so there's some</font>

207
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,330
theories about why you'd get an address

208
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:00,660
block and not route it maybe cuz you're

209
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:03,570
you're losing interest in ipv6 I guess

210
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,800
that could happen you're preparing for

211
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,140
the future i'm going to get mine now

212
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,459
before they change the rules maybe

213
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,459
you're just routing them internally

214
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:16,680
there's no correlation<font color="#E5E5E5"> between you know</font>

215
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,719
academia getting them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more being</font>

216
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,839
more likely to advertise and then then

217
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,720
commercial networks and that there's a

218
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,420
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> delay and especially in 2003 and</font>

219
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,270
2004 if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that chart with the</font>

220
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,589
bars a lot of allocations have been

00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,980
sitting out there for three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years and</font>

222

<font color="#E5E5E5">never showed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up in the routing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> table it</font>

says forty percent of them and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

224
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:43,589
some notable allocations and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think one</font>

225
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,050
of the big reasons why this slide is in

226
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:47,579
here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> filtering you</font>

227
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,029
just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be aware</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

228
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:53,189
lot of /<font color="#CCCCCC"> 48 s being allocated or signed</font>

229
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:56,060
and you might want to actually listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

230
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:58,980
them because there might be things there

231
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,529
like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are not over 90 direct</font>

232
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,470
assignments from Aaron that are / 48 and

233
00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:06,660
if you're filtering on a shorter prefix

234
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,110
you might miss them of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

235
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">only 15 of them right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

236
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,440
bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also some very large</font>

237
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,479
allocations to to corporate entities a

238
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:21,240
bunch to the registries and those can

239
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:23,380
all be found on the iono site let's see

240
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so there's some interesting things</font>

241
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:31,540
going on in the routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> table this one</font>

the beginning part the 2003<font color="#E5E5E5"> the / 19 and</font>

243
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,660
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the valid routes but this / 64</font>

244
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:40,060
nobody knows where it's coming from or

245
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:43,209
why it's there I mean obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> it looks</font>

246
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it's coming from 2386 but they</font>

247
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:48,609
haven't been able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> track</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down exactly</font>

248
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,410
why it's there or if it's some sort of

249
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:54,490
routing bug or if it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

250
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:55,839
advertisement so people should it seems

251
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,660
like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting to the point where it</font>

252
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,730
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be nobody filtered pretty much</font>

anything in v6 but it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

254
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:07,990
it's about time people did this one this

255
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I've been presenting this for</font>

256
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,279
you know in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of Europe for</font>

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">gear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it for a long long time and this</font>

258
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:19,360
bug has been going on forever<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

259
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:21,819
in certain instances if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the moon</font>

260
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,720
is right and you know you didn't pay

261
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:28,449
your taxes or whatever the router just

262
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,100
forgets to<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue a withdrawal for a</font>

263
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:31,510
prefix and just forgets like maybe

264
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,670
you're configuring something while that

265
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:36,160
happens and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just forgets so these</font>

266
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:41,430
these routes just stay around forever

267
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:44,920
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> never go away and it's that</font>

268
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:47,349
it's been reproduced it's in a bug fix

269
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,380
and it's been reproduced and fixed for

270
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,899
probably a year and it's still out there

271
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:58,630
so upgrading code is probably a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

272
00:12:52,899 --> 00:13:01,839
thing at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> point this one the normal</font>

273
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:05,079
path is the / 32 advertisement at the

274
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,699
top and no one's really sure where the

275
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:08,079
rest of these are coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from because</font>

276
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:12,519
they don't seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be actually be</font>

277
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,899
advertised by who it says and the one of

278
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:16,240
the theories is is somebody's

279
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:19,540
redistributing from BGP into their<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP</font>

280
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,910
and back into BGP again but more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

281
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">more than more likely would be</font>

282
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:27,550
there's some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a s path truncation</font>

283
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:30,010
going on and nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> really knows but</font>

284
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,900
there's these paths and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem</font>

285
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:35,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be coming from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody anywhere real</font>

286
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:37,449
and they're in the routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> table so it</font>

287
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,199
seems like BGP he's been around for a

288
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:48,850
long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't surprised it so buggy</font>

289
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:50,950
anyway um this this had this really made

290
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:53,410
me laugh because it reminds<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so much</font>

291
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:56,110
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the early NSFNET Nate days where we</font>

292
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:59,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">all had a UPS and all the routing was</font>

293
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,360
done based on some AUP and traceroute

294
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,910
came out and we'd get these we get these

295
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,110
emails that said oh well you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

296
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,589
get there but I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

297
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:11,170
way I got there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always some</font>

298
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,700
AUP but the the path was still decent

299
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,770
enough and short enough and the

300
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,800
performance was reasonable enough but in

301
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:20,079
v6 there's a UPS with these research

302
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,560
networks and then there's these tunnels

303
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,840
everywhere so so the the research

304
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,400
network isn't giving transit to

305
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:31,120
commercial customers because of their

306
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,650
acceptable use policy and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

307
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,210
traffic is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through this tunnel</font>

308
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,100
provider that saying oh I'll give you

309
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:39,370
transit only it's it's taking forever

310
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,040
and the packet loss is loss is huge so

311
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:44,170
it's starting to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the point where</font>

312
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,360
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it's really going to be</font>

313
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,130
affecting performance because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

314
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,500
way to get there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this path and the</font>

315
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:53,950
packet loss is huge on some of these

316
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:58,930
there's some more online in an<font color="#CCCCCC"> article</font>

317
00:14:53,950 --> 00:15:00,550
and so anyway I guess the routing there

318
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:05,020
is no running police though so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

319
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:08,709
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to skip that so this this graph is</font>

320
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:11,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot as a look at route objects in the</font>

321
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,480
routing database versus route seen in

322
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:17,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> routing table and it's not a direct</font>

323
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:19,510
correlation there's just the number of

324
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:21,310
route objects and the number of routes

325
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:24,189
is starting to be about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same but</font>

326
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:26,349
whether they're actually route objects

327
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:31,070
for those routes won't look at in the

328
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:35,570
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide because they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not so</font>

329
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:37,040
there are 421 bgp routes in the ripe

330
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,320
region and there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are four hundred</font>

331
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:44,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">twenty-five route objects and they're</font>

332
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:46,700
not entirely correlated so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> 409</font>

333
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,740
rat objects for unique prefixes and

334
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,510
there are some that actually matched the

335
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,970
prefixes and there are some that don't

336
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:56,270
have a route object that have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> vgp</font>

337
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:58,220
route in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table and the point of this</font>

338
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">is to get people to start putting their</font>

339
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,960
route objects in the routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> table so</font>

340
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:09,680
that people can actually do filtering so

341
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:11,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do it and it looks</font>

342
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,849
like what I want to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet it looks</font>

343
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">like in the ripe region there's a lot</font>

344
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,710
more route objects in the route database

345
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,920
but in the errand and other<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AR</font>

346
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:24,440
regions there aren't nearly as many<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

347
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,569
back to this I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> this this was an</font>

348
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,630
april fool's joke that became really

349
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,640
interesting so there's a path there's a

350
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,370
path for a route and they it looks at

351
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,439
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many miles the route actually is</font>

352
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,410
based on all the AS IS in the path so

353
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,720
there's one it's it's 40,000 kilometers

354
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:44,270
for that packet to get where it's going

355
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,490
you gotta love tunnels you just you just

356
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:49,610
got to love them and there's another<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

357
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:53,000
that's 39 thousand kilometers to get

358
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:54,680
your packet where it's going so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

359
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,580
get this tool and actually check it out

360
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:01,280
yourself it's pretty it's pretty fun

361
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:04,040
let's see and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the I guess this</font>

362
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,800
went really fast these are the different

363
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">tools that you can download there's a</font>

364
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,819
minimum hearing policy project that's

365
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:12,619
been going on forever there aren't a

366
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:14,899
whole last I checked there<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't a</font>

367
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:18,438
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hearing policies and v6 but</font>

368
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,660
I'm sure that'll happen more<font color="#CCCCCC"> overtime so</font>

369
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,130
and the slides are<font color="#E5E5E5"> available online and</font>

370
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">they get updated quite frequently</font>

371
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,850
whenever there's a right meeting because

372
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,829
garrett presents this at all the right

373
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:29,829
meetings does anybody have any questions

374
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:42,449
so quiet after the break no

375
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:42,449
I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>
