00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay as quick as I can this is about</font>

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,629
passive DNS some of you have heard about

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you haven't heard about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISC</font>

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:15,030
security information exchange which is

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,300
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to you so explain</font>

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,948
how DNS can be passive if you have a

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,590
recursive name server on your network

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,720
and you ask it or one of your customers

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,269
most likely asks it something that

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't know it will forward that query</font>

11
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,009
upstream and eventually get an answer

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,390
back which it will keep in its cache in

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,670
case it gets asked that question again

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,790
will also forward the response back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">the original person passive DNS consists</font>

16
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,649
of tapping into the flow of responses

17
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,870
coming from upstream coming from

18
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,940
Authority servers like the dot-com

19
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,218
servers or the google com servers or

20
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,410
whatever toward your<font color="#E5E5E5"> recursive name</font>

21
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:58,109
servers tapping into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and analyzing</font>

22
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:59,578
it in some way since it's a lightning

23
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,660
talk the only important thing here is

24
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,449
there's no personally identifiable

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,990
information the IP address of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client</font>

26
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,729
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not known we only see server to</font>

27
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,789
server traffic and of course we do not

28
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,310
see any reuse any of the times that the

29
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:19,020
cache is hit will not be noticed by

30
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:21,630
passive DNS cuz when it's below us what

31
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,619
can you do these are things I've seen

32
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:28,048
done so for example if you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

33
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,570
given<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address belongs to a commanding</font>

34
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,240
control server for a botnet and you see

35
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,520
it coming through as the a record or

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,380
quad a record for some new domain name

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,079
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might learn the new domain name</font>

38
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the new botnet before it has been</font>

39
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:48,329
seen or used elsewhere similar kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

40
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:51,750
tricks I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in April Lawrence ins</font>

41
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:54,149
work she has found a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bad like</font>

42
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,649
child pornography sites by simply

43
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,619
looking at who their name servers are

44
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,600
because bad sites tend to all cluster

45
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,340
together around a certain set of

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,570
nameservers that they then move around

47
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,399
several times<font color="#E5E5E5"> a day so by looking at new</font>

48
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,889
name servers having the same addresses

49
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,440
as known bad name servers or vice versa

50
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can sort of watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flow</font>

whatever so and it turns out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just be</font>

55
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:29,940
extremely useful to see all in one place

56
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:32,850
data that is otherwise not not

can to leave time for questions we have

74
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,640
asked April to look into a passive DNS

75
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,250
implementation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be based on</font>

SQL Florian's work is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

passive DNS data that we're currently

currently collecting so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

passive DNS efforts in the world than

86
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,420
there are various people that are doing

87
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,340
it and they all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start by getting</font>

88
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,260
together a group of sensors they'll call

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,390
their buddy who runs an ISP or is

90
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,950
responsible for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> university</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

91
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,250
and say could you put this passive DNS

92
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,589
sensor into your recursive name<font color="#CCCCCC"> server</font>

93
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that I may study your data and if</font>

94
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,650
they know enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> people then they can</font>

95
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,840
get enough data that they can either and

96
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,289
make their research project work or they

97
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,929
can start to<font color="#CCCCCC"> build their</font>

98
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:32,150
I was concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because I</font>

99
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,710
wanted it to be possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

100
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,979
of good work without having<font color="#E5E5E5"> your first</font>

101
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:40,849
task be to assemble a sensor network so

102
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:43,940
what we have tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is contact</font>

103
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,490
sensors and say if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> share it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with us</font>

104
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,530
then we will be the last person you hear

105
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,410
from because I will then share it in

106
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:54,109
turn with other trusted people nobody

107

passive DNS sensor on it it's also

110
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,180
important that when you're sharing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:09,550
data you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do not share it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with people who</font>

goldmine for people who want to learn

115
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,860
about you so I mean I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

116
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,630
you're all perfectly comfortable letting

117
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,070
Google know who you are and what you do

118
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,590
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you buy and where you travel</font>

119
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,180
and everything like that but turning

120
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:33,979
that around and doing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing for</font>

121
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:36,260
passive DNS would be a mistake as a

00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:40,090
trusted<font color="#CCCCCC"> nonprofit myself I was hoping we</font>

123
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:43,570
could help so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wrote some software</font>

124
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,500
similar to pcap but it tolerates

125
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:49,669
fragmentation and reassembly a little

126
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:52,100
better we have a sensor that basically

127
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:54,380
just collects a bunch of traffic and SCP

128
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,610
is it up to the mothership every couple

129
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,960
of minutes we have this collector

130
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,750
infrastructure that has a local<font color="#E5E5E5"> land</font>

131
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,609
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just rebroadcast the data on to</font>

132
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,710
that land so that different passive DNS

133
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:14,630
projects all see the data in real time

134
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:17,060
with no embargo and see here what I'm

135
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">hoping you will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is to take the role</font>

of being a sensor operator I'm hoping

146
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,210
interested in seven or eight hundred we

147
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,010
have probably about<font color="#E5E5E5"> five megabits right</font>

148
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,870
now around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clock of collected data</font>

149
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:54,280
being rebroadcast I'd like to get that

150
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:59,800
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gigabit by springtime so we need</font>

151
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:04,030
more data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is really just the</font>

152
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:07,750
first channel of many the<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of</font>

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:09,520
passive DNS is it fits<font color="#CCCCCC"> the description</font>

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,040
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that look better in daylight</font>

155
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,049
than by flashlight if you can see all

156
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">the data at once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can really</font>

157
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,860
characterize it as opposed to only seen

158
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:20,020
clearly that which you point your

159
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:25,390
flashlight at and therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> new to look</font>

160
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:28,090
at so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could send similarly</font>

161
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,250
centralized things like I don't know

162
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,609

163
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,950
failures things like that then someone

164
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,350
sitting at the center of the funnel I

165
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,030
would haven't have the ability to tell

166
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:43,180
the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between a typographical</font>

167
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:45,900
error and an outright attack or a scan

168
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:51,330
or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> dictionary attack</font>

169
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,330
and that's it so questions

170
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:04,010
we have three or four minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:07,310
questions yeah no questions I have a

172
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:10,099
question um I thought people don't mind

00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,450
anybody here quite happily go and just

175
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:17,170
by show of hands go and run an

176
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:20,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">instrumented because it name server and</font>
