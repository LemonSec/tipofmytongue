so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk today about a way</font>

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,160
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use routers for not things rather for</font>

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,469
things that are not specifically linked

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,190
oriented who wants a router raise your

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">hands at the hub</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 9</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the linksys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clean</font>

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dixie so if you want a router we</font>

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> load balancer as I</font>

8
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:28,560
discovered what's the point of was using

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,050
a router for a load balancer in my mind

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,089
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is is quite narrow it's for a</font>

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,399
collection of services that really don't

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a whole lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of value that is all</font>

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have value but they're not going to</font>

14
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,709
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> value in the sort of scale that</font>

15
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:43,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">you might see at Yahoo or at Google or</font>

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,559
it folks who do you know 300 machines

17
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,030
behind them address that kind of stuff

18
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,459
kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea here is that we want</font>

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,210
local a balancing sometimes for instance

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,710
things that have relieved the want wonky

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,010
behavior such as with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our client</font>

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,840
libraries and windows or unix boxes we

23
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,399
also want to use just the simplest

24
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,530
things possible i like the router i

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:09,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">already have it why add another piece of</font>

26
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,850
gear to affect load balancing so it my

27
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,770
concept for this generalized fast server

28
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,729
load balancing is simple utilize

29
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,100
existing structures with features within

30
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:23,850
hardware like ecmp in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,500
affect the same types of connection load

32
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,399
balancing behaviors as you see in more

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,720
stateful more aware more costly devices

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,369
the other important point<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention is</font>

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,020
that if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this in a router we</font>

36
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:35,939
benefit by all the work gone into the

37
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,640
forwarding paths I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of a</font>

38
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:42,179
single 10 gig layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 box that's not 10</font>

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,460
gigs that way three if it can do that

40
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,549
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not use it for distributing traffic</font>

41
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,710
to machines links are good but we can do

42
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,320
this with machines to i discovered so

43
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,669
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ingredients for this</font>

44
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,439
generalized fast server load balancing

45
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,079
needs a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> things to work really</font>

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,508
well on iOS is where I basically

47
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,149
implemented all of these things or<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

48
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,530
this process and it needs three things

49
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:06,570
need to spawn<font color="#CCCCCC"> stime reporters things</font>

50
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,239
that do health checks this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sometimes</font>

51
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">called IP SLA second thing we need is an</font>

52
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,120
enhanced tracking feature tracking

53
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,409
objects were around for a long time

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,060
I am to make sure one interface could

55
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:18,700
follow them another interfaces state for

56
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,940
example taking down one port if any<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

57
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,190
wink I group went down for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance this</font>

58
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,769
now can track other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP SLA</font>

59
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,510
objects in iOS so the configuration can

60
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:30,640
solve those two things both of those are

61
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the underpinnings for the ECM p to work</font>

62
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,679
well once you do all these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

63
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:39,459
affect this generalized fast server load

64
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,440
balancing concept why is this good for

65
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,329
us if we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a router to affect</font>

66
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,620
server load balancing and do it in a

67
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,329
very simplistic manner with the

68
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,920
previously<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned things the track</font>

69
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:50,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">and they round about the response time</font>

70
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,510
reporters we don't have to run ospf for

71
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,769
bgp or whatever well as we were doing to

72
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,599
our end hosts which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've heard a lot</font>

73
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,220
about from a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people that's not a</font>

74
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,409
bad concept but it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

75
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,349
extra work it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems as if in many</font>

76
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:04,750
locations or many circumstances you

77
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,220
won't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roni protocol to</font>

78
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device you wish to load balance the</font>

79
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,659
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so it's kind of an onstar in</font>

80
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,359
some ways and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can remove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

81
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:15,159
with these mechanisms another good good

82
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,290
point about this concept is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

83
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:19,599
all it's all routing there's no state on

84
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,660
this stuff when the packet comes in

85
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,399
headers used create the hash the source

86
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">and destination IP addresses in cisco</font>

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,410
ccnp case minimally affect the death

selection of the next top this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

cry from things that know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

90
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,410
and escorts things that know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

91
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:36,369
nature of the URL<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in our case we're</font>

92
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:38,760
not going to be concerned with those

93
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:41,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">things so strip them away use the router</font>

94
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">how does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it look effectively we have</font>

95
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:45,190
just two pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal route router</font>

96
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:48,250
you always had and for the sake of

97
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,750
example we're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 that in this case</font>

98
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,930
we have three machines we care about and

99
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want to say that we'd like to have</font>

100
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,799
them all handle the same load for a

101
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:59,230
common address let's call it you'll see

102
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,910
in the later on we'll have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NP do</font>

103
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,048
these three machines in this case what

104
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,500
we're doing is called direct server

105
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:07,540
returned or each machines target service

106
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,910
address is living on a loopback not on

107
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,519
the ethernet interface in that / 29 in

108
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:15,970
that access via when the return traffic

109
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,899
is next top to 1000 one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

110
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:21,219
we have this interface VLAN 100 again

111
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:25,090
director of return does the right thing

112
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:26,590
from dot 0 dot 3 episode 2 and 3<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,349
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

114
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,119

these enumerated with similar dressing

as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you here so text config</font>

117
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,139
again VLAN interface you always have

118
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,510
that response time reporters this is

119
00:04:38,139 --> 00:04:43,210
kind of a simple example just two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

120
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:45,729
them we're doing our<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario based on</font>

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,160
try the first and fail to the second but

124
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,380
I don't like the fact that they never

<font color="#E5E5E5">tried the second to begin with this is</font>

126

an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> silly load rather</font>

loosely workload created by resolver

128
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,530
libraries I rather have both machines

129
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,950
take some of the load why not I'm paying

130

<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the power I also prefer that if one</font>

132
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:12,400
anybody about that and wouldn't have to

133
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,410
have customers becoming enraged or angry

134
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,690
that they're waiting for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> timeout to</font>

135
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,460
get to the second server if we have

136
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,010
these response time reporters checking

137
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,409
two and three the actual servers here if

138
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,750
one goes down our following config will

139
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,610
track that we have track one in fact to

140
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,220
tracking response time reporter 1 and

141
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">response some reporter 2 now why is that</font>

142
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,080
useful it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful up to this right</font>

143
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:37,750
right bring this part here is standard

144
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,419
ecmp routes are configured manually

145
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,310

154

I'm sorry 130 like and 10 10 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 goes</font>

157
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,510
to 3 into a light with track one failing

158
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,500
where those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are also be expired we'd</font>

159
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,010
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the load to the remaining</font>

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:21,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine comp out the same is true for</font>

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:24,070
track<font color="#E5E5E5"> two how's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it look under the hood</font>

162
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,739
if you do with show IP SEF internal for

163
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:28,870
that particular next top you'll for any

164
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,450
of them you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the 16 hash buckets</font>

165
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:35,080
ultimately have themselves pointed to

166
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:36,849
two and three in the case of even

167
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,500
numbers of routes this works just fine a

168
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:39,909
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco has always had or</font>

169
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,220
seems to have had for a long time

170
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:45,070
uneven distribution of which hash bucket

171
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,900
points to what next top in current code

172
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:49,330
my observations are that you actually do

173
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,580
see SEF resize things or recarved things

174
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,550
into odd members of buckets in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

175
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:57,460
with three ballad next ops 2 3<font color="#E5E5E5"> &</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 it</font>

176
00:06:54,550 --> 00:07:01,810
truncates the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15th bucket kind of cool</font>

177
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:04,330
finally so some examples of doing this

178
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,910
here's a quick test we did 2 nameservers

179
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,830
up pointing queries towards ns1

180
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">pseudo-random sources</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a stupid</font>

181
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,750
little script running through and we see

182
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:17,670
about ten percent equivalence up above

183
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:21,070
balance so yeah it works<font color="#CCCCCC"> who'd a thought</font>

184
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:23,710
some caveats obviously today ecmp and

185
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,840
cisco 16 paths maximally this can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

186
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,000
resolved by having two switches we've

187
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,310
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> some chaining if you will where</font>

188
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,160
once which has<font color="#CCCCCC"> two next hops living in</font>

189
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:36,070
the second switch each of those machines

190
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,230
each of those next hops then for a

191
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine a machine be if you will can</font>

192
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,310
have multiple more parallel using few

193
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,560
routes so if you were to go totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> hog</font>

195
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,640
the 16th possible machines behind this

196
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,590
concept with two switches<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wouldn't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend it may be a server irons good</font>

198
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,890
then but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it certainly is something you</font>

199
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,380
might already have in the rack so why

200
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:59,080
not connection tracking doesn't really

201
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,060
exist if a machine were to fail<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

204
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,130
you have of connections aren't

205
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,590
guaranteed to be sustained to the

206
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,580
machine that we're currently going to

207
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:12,549
because the hash buckets are going to be

208
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,620
recurve completely a session that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

two if furry fails that's a an issue but

212
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,880
be aware of it you also don't have the

213

ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to let the protocol in this case</font>

214
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,969
ecmp is not really protocol but the

215
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,740
mechanism doesn't know at the load of

216
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,240
the underlying machines for an

more complicated whether interface to

wanted to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> net features I guess 723</font>

bxl whatever can do this translation

231
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,040
you're going to have flow over a head

232
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,500
for connection setup and teardown just

233
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,469
deal with that interestingly in this
