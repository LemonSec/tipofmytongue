00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about that this is mostly</font>

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,420
social political talk but my coworker

00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:19,680
Maz will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually opening the kimono</font>

and talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it at starting at a</font>

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:27,210
meeting in two weeks and it'll make it

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,939
around maybe to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next nanog Rick we</font>

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,880
will transition to ipv6 or we're going

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a real v4 whore with massive</font>

matting get over it the issues are<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,019
and how the marketing fantasy that has

13
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:46,829
been going on in the past has not been

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:50,969
helping it it confuses people it makes

15
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,649
expectations that aren't met etc so this

16
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,270
presentation can seem negative

17
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,190
especially I'm going to go the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,430
string is going to be dispelled myths

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,218
but it's really trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get rid of the</font>

20
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:06,689
roads colored glasses so we as operators

21
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:11,100
can actually get on a deployment path<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

22
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:14,880
Lucy my dear friend summarizes it no

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,850
more BS no more<font color="#E5E5E5"> excuses shut up and</font>

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,600
spend the money you don't spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now</font>

25
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,798
it's going to really cost you more<font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,860
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a stressful movement she's</font>

27
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,939
normally much more polite what should

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:34,140
have happened is as the IP free for free

29
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:39,649
pool slowly depleted and as ipv6

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:42,630
deployment went out because ipv6 worked

31
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:45,710
things would be great and we'd be

32
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:49,170
nearing the crossover point today and

33
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:52,020
ipv4 would not be an expensive resource

34
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,619
and a scarce resource because ipv6 would

35
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:59,100
be doing well what's actually happening

36
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,969
is the ipv4 pool is running out quickly

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,589
because ipv6 is not being deployed if

38
00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:07,469
you see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> today it shows a little</font>

39
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,330
inflection in the v6 deployment many of

40
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,239
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends tell me they didn't think I</font>

41
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,970
was that much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an optimist</font>

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,640
okay and so what is going to happen

43
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:20,820
consequentially excuse me picking on one

44
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,260
of these two<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that v4 is going to call</font>

46
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,310
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the driver for ipv6</font>

47
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,930
it's not going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> three GG cell</font>

just stuns me the darn things don't

58

interoperate the real reason was a

just like they do in before and the

106
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:28,039
routing table will fragment more and

107
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:31,370
more over<font color="#CCCCCC"> time ok transition will ease</font>

108
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:33,650
routing is another myth one this is the

market base we're going to charge for b6

110

of them early adopters are actually

negligible but at least that makes look

187
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:20,889
like the routers can handle the traffic

how to transition without losing anyone

00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:08,560
or anything what we can do is

218
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:13,540
make the transition easier what we have

<font color="#E5E5E5">to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that how we have to actually</font>

identified them for the protocol issues

v6 and the tools to transition and by

00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,300
to prepare to deal with title to v4 and

registries are out front here what we

230
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,969
should not do is pretend there are no

231
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:49,319
problems we should not<font color="#CCCCCC"> give away v6</font>

is v4 run out not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fantasies we</font>

237
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:06,460
what's happening is we're being killed

238
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:09,040

00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:08,490
so every v6 site needs to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to smtp to arbitrary other v4</font>

326
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:17,220
sites therefore every one of them needs

327
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:21,060
an agreement right with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual stack</font>

328
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:26,070
relay until the whole world is dual

332
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:38,459
you're used to that for the enterprise

333
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:46,410
that means I is the enterprise must run

334
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:48,180
a dual stack relay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay no hack how come</font>

335
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:50,370
things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> better in Japan how'd it get</font>

336
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:53,699
that way how come it's easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more</font>

337
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:56,250
widely deployed because folk with vision

338
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:59,970
mainly more I son say convinced the

339
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:02,310
government early that v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> was needed and</font>

340
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,890
wise Japan's very good at investing

341
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,599
early the government actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> gave</font>

342
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:10,589
excuse me this wouldn't work with yen

343
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:14,730
symbol so I stole dollars um supported

344
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:17,909
ipv6 research with money they supported

345
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,099
ipv6 development actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> product</font>

346
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,199
development by the industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> and vendors</font>

347
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:26,188
and the government even<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives tax</font>

348
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:30,270
incentives now to end enterprises which

349
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:32,220
become v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> which deploy ipv6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the</font>

350
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:38,820
government instead of regulating beating

351
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:42,750
etc etc used a carrot amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what</font>

352
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:45,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">can we do we want one internet</font>

353
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:47,430
do not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fragment it so during</font>

354
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,140
transition everybody has to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

355
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:51,570
talk to everyone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> at will as we do</font>

356
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:53,910
today and we'd love to keep the m10

357
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,830
principle as much as possible and if we

358
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,080
have to compromise it we would like to

359
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:01,740
compromise it in a temporary fashion

360
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,730
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have some hope will go away dual</font>

361
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:07,800
stack the core needs to be dual stack

362
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:10,380
during all of transition or the Kluge's

363
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,990
will escalate the further dual stack

364
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:16,410
goes towards the edge the easier it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

365
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:18,990
be this means all the configuration

366
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:21,660
management measurement etc etc that we

367
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:24,840
the ISPs among us need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do really</font>

368
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,700
needs to be simplified there are five

369
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,100
phases of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition we're in the</font>

370
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,260
first denial from both sides we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

371
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:35,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">ignore</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brain dead miss design botched I</font>

372
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:37,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">cv6 and on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other side is ipv6 is</font>

373
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:41,940
perfect and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> greedy fools just have</font>

374
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:43,800
to deploy it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay neither are right this</font>

375
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,160
is the internet we are shared community

376
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:50,370
etc the next phase will be dual stack

377
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:53,100
with ipv4 dominant then they'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

378
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:55,320
in balance and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a dual</font>

379
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,899
stack with v6 dominant and then we'll

380
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually be to the ipv6 room internet</font>

381
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:04,440
and getting ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the VIP v10</font>

382
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:07,889
transition<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Nats the end-to-end</font>

383
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:10,560
principle we love<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but because v6 is</font>

384
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:15,590
on the wire incompatible we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't got no</font>

385
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:20,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">choice there will be nice get over it</font>

386
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:23,129
that PT is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need at the edge the</font>

387
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,350
enterprise consumer etc need to run v6

388
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:30,150
internally but need to get out to both

389
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:34,199
v4 and v6 people so when v6 becomes

390
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:36,840
dominant it's the converse<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ipv4 only</font>

391
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,530
sites will not want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT so they can</font>

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:49,820
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the v6 internet the ITF needs to</font>

don't do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok which gives you clue</font>

about how head in the sand the ITF has

been about the problems of operational

transition that has changed the ITF is

408

now working and reworking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> PT and we</font>

424
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:42,330
ninety-six percent of ISPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> die right</font>

425
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:49,519
it's going to be like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to buy a</font>

full telco switch you will die and

427
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:56,130
enterprises cannot be multihomed on the

428
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,809
day of default free zone because they

429
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,850
don't want the lonely monster

430
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:04,399
enterprises will want to spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

and LA for those of you remember and

it stop adding features to v6 to make it

00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:59,090
operators the oh well we're not going to

464
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:00,710
do it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now because that's coming</font>

465
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:05,240
around the corner we'd have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all</font>

466
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:11,150
over again we need very little change

467
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:14,630
nat PT especially and then let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

deploy it give<font color="#E5E5E5"> us a chance to deploy it</font>

about ula or

policies over the next few months and

475
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:36,210
then let's move forward this is a very

hard thing for all the ISPs all the

563
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:13,019
actually deploying and that's that's

564
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:15,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">really important and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you sort of get</font>

565
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:18,599
different perspectives from different

566
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:21,208
organizations like on the IETF from some

567
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:23,569
of the lists it feels almost like every

568
00:29:21,209 --> 00:29:25,559
hour there's someone who's proposing

569
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:27,359
rearranging the beat somehow in some

570
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:29,879
neighbor discovery protocol or something

571
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:32,879
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's just not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wave</font>

572
00:29:29,879 --> 00:29:36,478
or forward but I did have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

573
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:41,389
comments so one thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

574
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:47,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">you overestimated the or you I think you</font>

575
00:29:41,389 --> 00:29:50,099
expected the compatibility of v4 and v6

576
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,779
to be easier the other on the wire

577
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:53,698
compatibility to be easier than it would

578
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:56,759
really actually have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been so not quite</font>

579
00:29:53,699 --> 00:29:59,329
sure that's so easy to do but in any

580
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:02,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">case that's what around of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Brits and</font>

581
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:05,399
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> shouldn't really go back to the 90's</font>

582
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:07,529
and and redesign<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything so let's</font>

583
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:10,708
work with what we have now the other

584
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:12,949
comment is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ipsec stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

585
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:17,819
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we really are over the pixie dust</font>

586
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:21,059
story not right now and ipsec is good

587
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:22,979
for certain things it's not good for all

588
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:27,479
things and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really the same for v4</font>

589
00:30:22,979 --> 00:30:30,809
and v6 and there are configuration

590
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:32,549
problems ease of use and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

591
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:35,309
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think anyone is claiming at this</font>

592
00:30:32,549 --> 00:30:38,009
point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have one tool that will</font>

593
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:42,539
solve all your security problems so use

594
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:46,169
the right tools for the job<font color="#CCCCCC"> poor</font>

595
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:47,789
percentage what part is what realize

596
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:50,789
that silly but I mean is the kind of

597
00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:52,529
thing you're saying IP IP SEC is going

598
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:54,449
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> only solve half the things I think</font>

599
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:57,299
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be good for eighty ninety</font>

600
00:30:54,449 --> 00:31:00,509
percent or am I really in trouble yeah I

601
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:02,129
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very good for VPN I have yet</font>

602
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:02,610
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find a very good match for other</font>

603
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:11,939
problem

604
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:15,919
