1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:09,690
so hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm leo kouda from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can and</font>

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:14,219
there's a problem with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">addresses that iono will be allocating</font>

4
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:20,550
to our IRS over the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years</font>

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,789
and I like to think of it as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the popcorn</font>

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,039
problem which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> popcorn at the</font>

7
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,199
top of the carton is really good and

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,730
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get down towards the bottom in</font>

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,980
the cart and the popcorn gets a little

10
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:38,489
bit more crunchy and what the problem is

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,110
is that some networks out there are

12
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:46,410
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> unallocated IP address space and</font>

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:49,519
that's not very<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice and the networks</font>

14
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:54,300
that we're aware of well some of them

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:57,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network one massive private use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five is</font>

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,620
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero comp VPNs like the hamachi</font>

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:05,720
service 42 in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of documentation</font>

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:09,929
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the HP procurve as the</font>

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:15,630
default address range when configuring

20
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:18,210
that 104 is apparently used by the mesh

21
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,710
networking community not the grid

22
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,220
networking community which I recently

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:27,149
found out is a different community there

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:31,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">are other networks out there but they're</font>

25
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:36,810
widely used in services and enterprises

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:40,079
and that means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we allocate one</font>

27
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:45,149
of these / 82 an RA are and they

28
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:48,270
allocate it to an ISP who gives it to a

29
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,759
customer to configure on their network

30
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:56,369
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite as unique as everyone was</font>

31
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:58,740
hoping and that's tricky because what

32
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,770
normally happens is ISPs get support

33
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,640
calls and my understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when an</font>

34
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,679
ISP so that's getting a support call

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,750
they start losing any profit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,080
were going to be getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that</font>

37
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,350
customer

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,840
so it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice if the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprises</font>

39
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:22,489
that could renumber into either unique

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:28,640
address space or into ipv6 ula s or RFC

41
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:32,090
1918 space or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that ipv6</font>

42
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:37,299
space there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it I'm sure it</font>

43
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:43,520
works really really well alternatively

44
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:45,530
wing and a prayer so that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,070
presentation I just wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

46
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:52,790
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this will be happening these</font>

47
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:56,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">addresses which are already in use are</font>

48
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:58,459
going to be allocated<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our IRS and</font>

49
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:01,190
they will go out to ISPs and customers

50
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:08,690
and they'll they'll be like crunchy

51
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:11,810
pieces of popcorn that's it we have time

52
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:17,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">for questions quite a lot of time for</font>

53
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:20,450
questions if anybody has any Brian<font color="#CCCCCC"> exim</font>

54
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:23,329
I'm is the problem mostly packets that

55
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:30,190
are seen from those address spaces or is

56
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:32,780
it routes I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's as so much</font>

57
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">routes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think the problem is more</font>

58
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:39,470
going to happen a bit like with 41 / 8

59
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,320
which was allocated to<font color="#CCCCCC"> afrinic and there</font>

60
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:47,000
was a discussion on nanoka novelists

61
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:49,250
about how someone was unable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect</font>

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to their mail server because their isp</font>

63
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:55,220
was using it internally as private

64
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,160
address space and it was also allocated

65
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:01,430
to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP in Africa who was providing</font>

66
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:05,930
mail services on it that's the sort of

67
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:09,260
issue that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see ya I'm</font>

68
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,790
jolly egli um yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

69
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,220
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been observed with a</font>

70
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,548
relatively high amount of frequency with

71
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:19,668
other existing address space allocations

72
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:21,589
when people brought put their networks

73
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:23,450
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet and discovered the space</font>

74
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,919
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were using internally was in</font>

75
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,539
fact used somewhere else

76
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,510
you know that includes things like oh

77
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:35,300
you know for / 8 you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

78
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:39,380
which you know are used by<font color="#E5E5E5"> real networks</font>

79
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,660
I'm sure it's this isn't a new problem i

80
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:47,810
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's going to get a little</font>

81
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:52,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more painful absolutely um I mean</font>

82
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:54,110
we've observed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last Internet boom</font>

83
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,390
cycle a number of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> with product</font>

84
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,730
development things who said to me well

85
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,830
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the probability of 43 /a being</font>

86
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:03,260
used we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this because RFC</font>

87
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,570
1918 is ambiguous and I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

88
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:09,740
probability is about a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred percent</font>

89
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:14,930
so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's something that comes up</font>

90
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:17,120
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time people design stuff and if</font>

91
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,250
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are no more questions I'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

92
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,520
thank Leo and ask Brian Dixon's come up

93
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,520
to the podium
