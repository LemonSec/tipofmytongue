00:00:01,429 --> 00:00:06,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay hello I'm Josh Carlin from the</font>

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,890
University of New Mexico this is work

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,050
that I did with<font color="#E5E5E5"> my advisor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Stephanie</font>

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,059

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,130
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i presented my work pretty good</font>

7
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:23,609
bgp it got<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think pretty good reception</font>

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,560
and some some criticisms in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wear</font>

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">it with a badge of pride that Randy Bush</font>

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,869
gave up to the mic and said don't listen

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,710
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that guy overall though I thought it</font>

12
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">was good and I got a lot of good</font>

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">response and thanks to that I've now</font>

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,760
gone back and made a second generation

15
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,959
of pretty good bgp and i have a new set

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,989
of tools that i'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to present to you</font>

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,090
today so first of all is a recap what

18
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,070
was pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good bgp before well the</font>

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,260
basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is autonomous security for</font>

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,660
autonomous systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and that means</font>

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can deploy a security system for</font>

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,440
your autonomous system without worrying

23
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:58,288
about and relying upon other autonomous

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,989
systems to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same so this means no</font>

25
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,120
public key infrastructure it means not

26
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,030
revealing sensitive information to the

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,250
public and registers and primarily it

28
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,930
means immediate protection significant

29
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,850
immediate protection for early adopters

30
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,299
otherwise why deploy who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

31
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,798
deploy and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way we approach this was</font>

32
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,210
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all we looked at a small</font>

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,869
apartment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> said let's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

34
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,399
hydrex prefix and sub prefix hijacks and

35
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:25,110
what we broke it down into three

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,060
problems first let's detect them and

37
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,250
once we've detected then we'll let

38
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,780
operators know that hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> look here's a</font>

39
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,210
potential hijack you should know about

40
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,220
it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only so useful because</font>

41
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,960
well the hijacks already propagated you

42
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,729
would rather the high hijack actually

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,289
was suppressed so here's what we did we

44
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,000
came up with a detector this is a

45
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">history based detector that says these</font>

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,990
are the origin is is that we've seen for

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,939
each prefix over time if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see a new</font>

48
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,619
origin is for a prefix well guess what

49
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">that could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hijack right we mark it</font>

50
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,299
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> suspicious we notify operators of the</font>

51
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,829
problem with the internet alert registry

52
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,570
this is a website<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's now been live</font>

53
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:02,398
for over a year that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> dunn's of</font>

54
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,350
dozens of operators so<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently</font>

55
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:11,068
subscribed from tier 1 networks on down

56
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:12,599
and it lets the origin<font color="#CCCCCC"> a.s of the das</font>

57
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,250
being hijacked and the one performing

58
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,359
the Hydra

59
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">know about the problem these are the</font>

60
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,430
relevant is is that can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

61
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:22,910
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it so okay now we've</font>

62
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:25,100
notified operators but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> better as I</font>

63
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,540
said if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually suppress the</font>

64
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,450
propagation of the ramp<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what we</font>

65
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,190
do is we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty good</font>

66
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,769
VG p the detector on the routers

67
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,890
themselves and then once they detect a

68
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:39,470
suspicious route deep reference it for

69
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,779
24 hours note i did not say discard it

70
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,520
just lower its preference and try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

71
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,690
the more stable trusted routes if you

72
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:52,489
can giving operators the time to fix the

73
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:54,200
route before it can propagate so a lot

74
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,340
of the criticism I received was that you

75
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,440
know what there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways around this</font>

76
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,510
yeah the idea was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say why don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

77
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,760
handle misconfigurations first we have

78
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,010
done that but what about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a malicious</font>

79
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,780
adversary someone that could instead say

80
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,549
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just prepend the legitimate</font>

81
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,620
origin I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask and then send that off</font>

82
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,930
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's what I'm going to call a</font>

83
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,910
spoof ditch a path that includes a link

84
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,030
that doesn't actually exist in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

85
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:20,030
topology next what about policy

86
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,590
violations what if an AS propagates a

87
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,030
rail learn from a provider appear to

88
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,340
someone other than its customers say to

89
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,810
another provider appear right we should

90
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,860
be able to detect that and stop it if

91
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:32,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible so that's what we did first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

92
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">all I just want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show you like how</font>

93
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:38,000
effective each form of quote-unquote

94
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,470
attack might be so sub prefix hijacks on

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,930
an unprotected network with unfiltered

96
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,670
network are very problematic as you can

97
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,410
imagine prefix hijacks are a little bit

98
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,850
worse and then now we're looking at the

99
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,680
lower end of the spectrum the spoof pre

100
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:53,480
pens and the policy violations so now

101
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">where is pretty good bgp today and what</font>

102
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:58,220
tools do i have to offer well our

103
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,829
detector now except hijacks smooth edges

104
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,540
and policy violations the internet alert

105
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:05,900
registry which once would send<font color="#E5E5E5"> you an</font>

106
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,548
<font color="#CCCCCC">email for each positive suspicious</font>

107
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,100
threat will can actually be configured

108
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:12,530
to only give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> positive notification</font>

109
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,609
and finally we're actually looking at

110
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,029
building this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have been</font>

111
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:18,410
developing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this in quagga zebra for not</font>

112
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:20,358
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> long now it's not all that big a</font>

113
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,830
hack to the router quite frankly and

114
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:23,830
i'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

115
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did we have to do to the</font>

116
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,220
pretty good<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp detection algorithm to</font>

117
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:35,380
find spoofed edges and policy violations

118
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,270
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy this</font>

119
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,219
goes right<font color="#E5E5E5"> along with pretty good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

120
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,630
style you just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for the last two</font>

121
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,340
months what are all the edges that I've

122
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,800
seen in paths right keep Eric to them

123
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,109
and then if you get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new route with a</font>

124
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,220
new path that has an edge you haven't

125
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,410
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> before in the last two months you</font>

126
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,169
flag it<font color="#CCCCCC"> as suspicious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in response</font>

127
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you again do you preference it for 24</font>

128
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:59,740
hours so as an example here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

129
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:02,290
in the past we've seen path ABCD so we

130
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,570
now we know and can trust a BBC CD as

131
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:07,990
valid edges and then we receive a new

132
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,340
path abd well a be that checks out we've

133
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,620
seen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> before but BD is new that</font>

134
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">could potentially be a smooth prepend</font>

135
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,720
right the nice thing about this just

136
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,400
simple edge detection algorithm is that

137
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can actually detect policy violations</font>

138
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,310
as well so intuitively just think about

139
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,260
it as the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> around from your</font>

140
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,390
provider or your peer should only be

141
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,159
sent to your customer so that edge from

142
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,860
u to your provider appear in this case

143
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,979
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call that B to C should</font>

144
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,150
only ever be seen by your customers your

145
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:39,760
provider appears should never see the

146
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,280

148
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,320
three examples a.s.a will always be

149
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,270
receiving a new edge which is bc and

150
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,620
will detect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as a spoofed edge or a</font>

151
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:56,770
policy violation<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so that's the</font>

152
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,289
new detector now the tools the internet

153
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,549
alert registry<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when going strong and</font>

154
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:03,010
for all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time has been sending out</font>

155
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,330
emails to operators and I made one

156
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:07,180
slight change to it which is I just

157
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">added an RSS feed of alerts which is you</font>

158
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,020
know nothing big and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend</font>

159
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that operators actually try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

160
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,830
subscribe to the RSS feed and read them

161
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,020
all it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> waste of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time in fact I think</font>

162
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:20,050
instead you should run a program called

163
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,390
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iar trekker which reads your BGP</font>

164
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:25,060
configurations and then reads and scans

165
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:27,370
the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of current alerts and will only</font>

166
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">not notify you of true positives right</font>

167
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,370
so you've configured this thing on your

168
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:33,650
end it's running on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> host and</font>

169
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,270
we'll find the true positives in the

170
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,440
list of alerts and send you an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email you</font>

171
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,510
don't have to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all positives</font>

172
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,130
whatsoever without revealing any network

173
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:45,199
information because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the</font>

174
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:47,300
scan anonymously<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so why should</font>

175
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,889
you care does it actually work so the

176
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,630
questions you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might ask our is it</font>

177
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:52,699
effective are there a lot of false

178
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:57,050
positives and if so how will these false

179
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:58,220
positives affect my network well it is

180
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,510
immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective for each</font>

policy violations and spoofed edges a

more interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> question might be what</font>

187
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,789
if we just partially deployed this on

188
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,650
the internet what if so say only a few a

<font color="#E5E5E5">esas were to deploy this what global</font>

192
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,389
simulation you have on the x-axis the

193
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,030
number of autonomous systems that have

197
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,460
of simulated attacks and we see how

198
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,919
effective they are so without any pretty

199
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,659
good BGP deployment and no filtering

200
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:40,430
whatsoever you see that sub prefix

201
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,520
hijacks are completely effective prefix

202
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:46,669

a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ssf deployed these are 100</font>

205
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,300
largest mind you you'll see that

206
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,460
actually the the effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these attacks</font>

207
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">is mostly minimalized in fact pretty</font>

208
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:03,250
much negligible and that's a hundred out

209
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:05,479
of 25,000 a SS independently running us

210
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:08,870
all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> next question are there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

211
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:11,180
of false positives yeah there are the

212
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">iar discovers what like 150 to 200</font>

213
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:16,550
anomalies per day the large ISPs would

214
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,810
receive one maybe two emails a day which

215
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,370
is nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knock centers and</font>

216
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,770
then those on the periphery might see

217
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,240
receive one a year again if you use true

218
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,560
positive only notification that you

219
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,260
don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the number is you want</font>

220
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,030
the ball so then the question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

221
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a lot of false positives but how</font>

222
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">will they affect my network well first</font>

223
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,700
keep in mind that<font color="#CCCCCC"> reachable reach</font>

224
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,830
ability isn't lost your deep referencing

225
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,990
routes not discarding them so if there

226
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,419
is a flap or an edge goes down and

227
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,070
suddenly you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a new edge or a new</font>

228
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,670
origin asked for a prefix you'll route

229
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,340
to it if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have any other</font>

230
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:50,400
but the idea is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust and use the the</font>

231
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,860
stable<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rams and the next thing is that</font>

232
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,910
most of these false positives are

233
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,320
positives in general actually don't last

234
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,140
long they don't stay in your router long

235
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,990
most of them will disappear within the

236
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,569
first hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a good majority over</font>

237
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:09,420
the next 24 hours most don't last to the

238
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:10,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">full 24 so to conclude I'm trying to</font>

239
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,270
impress upon you that it is possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

240
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,970
protect networks without global

241
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:16,890
cooperation pretty good BGP is a simple

now and we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a prototype</font>

247
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,300
router implementation it should be

available<font color="#CCCCCC"> soon the University of New</font>

Mexico's IT s department has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

250
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,510
enough to cooperate with me and help me

251
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,190
test this and additional help from you

252
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,689
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really appreciated because I</font>

don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any resources I'm a student</font>

254
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:46,250
this is my dissertation work and thank

255
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,250
you

256
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:58,040
to a panic a very quick question you

257
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,020
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> said a second ago most of the</font>

258
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,069
things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see last for less than an</font>

259
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:05,630
hour yeah well that one yeah how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

260
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:08,029
them last for less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixty five</font>

261
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,380
seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the way no that's a religion</font>

262
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:11,420
and western I don't know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer</font>

263
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,580
because part of the issue about<font color="#E5E5E5"> false</font>

264
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,979
positives is actually be gp's path

265
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,720
exploration to withdraw sure where you

266
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually explore paths you wouldn't</font>

267
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:24,410
normally see simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're doing</font>

268
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:27,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bgp dance and if you actually had a</font>

269
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:30,079
timer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I'm going to ignore</font>

270
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,700
these things for a period of time until

271
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,580
I'm satisfied it's not part of path

272
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,990
expiration how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those would you</font>

273
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,820
get rid of and what would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

274
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,490
certainty factor of what's getting it

275
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:43,580
left as distinct from what you're doing

276
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:46,100
now you see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm saying that there</font>

277
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,110
are transient paths that appear simply

278
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,029
because bgp is doing the normal thing

279
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,460
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> purely transient you can ignore it</font>

280
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:55,070
but if they stick<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your route up for a</font>

281
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,320
longer period of time it's actually

282
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,300
someone doing an advertisement not bgp

283
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,980
dancing and that's the ones you're

284
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:06,020
actually interested in yeah and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

285
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,339
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the next question if you're</font>

286
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,610
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do any kind of update</font>

287
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:13,940
suppression rather than alerting you

288
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:16,070
simply don't propagate how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

289
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,839
would you not propagate and why in other

places about update load you said what

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:30,189
I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of point out is that</font>

295
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:33,199
if bgp had an affinity for stable paths

296

and it saw other paths and said<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

going to wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a while before i</font>

300
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:47,449
could you remove from propagating onward

301
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,730
I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea about thirty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

304
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,880
interesting thing here is what I'm

305
00:11:54,589 --> 00:12:00,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think it leads in a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

places Scott library enter now you

ignore longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I danced around that issue</font>

311
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,990
because it's the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> part that's</font>

00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:20,150
slightly different from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest sub</font>

continues to route to the super prefix

are the greater net for 24 hours so this

320
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one small area corner case where</font>

00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,970
filtering it and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a decision</font>

328

put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in the router their christian</font>

use for degrading the preference of

route do you have more rational for this

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,280
time frame or<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it is it a number that</font>

335
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:16,640
it's just easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle or I mean you</font>

336
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:19,880
you have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that after</font>

one hour most and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> humanity's</font>

actually go away what's actually the

percentage of an animal<font color="#CCCCCC"> aditi's that go</font>

that have been gone after 24 hours is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

341
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,140
that it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the type so as you</font>

342
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,240
can see in this graph the sub prefixes

343
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:41,150
tend to actually be legitimate more

344
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">often than new priya hijacks our prefix</font>

345
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:46,160
hijacks so maybe about twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

346
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,319
thirty percent actually go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on after the</font>

24 hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> i forgot the first part of your</font>

question well basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two it's</font>

349
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,980
related to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was just wondering</font>

350
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">what reginald you had for why the 24</font>

351
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,520
hours that's simply said that operators

352
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,130
can respond I mean we're all in a

353
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:06,250
different clock so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to give</font>

354
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:06,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">people enough to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks</font>
