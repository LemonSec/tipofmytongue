<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the inspiration for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the work</font>

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,799
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did and the work that a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,869
other people have done which I'll get to

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,730
at the end if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen this</font>

11
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:38,010
picture this is a comic called XKCD and

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:40,199
this came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think earlier this year</font>

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,839
or maybe the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of last year and it was</font>

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">a really clever way of organizing the</font>

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:55,620
ipv4 address space and it's labeled and

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:57,000
everything so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that his map uses Hilbert</font>

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,530
curve and if you've never seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Hilbert</font>

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,410
curve this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example of one this is</font>

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">a fourth-order Hilbert curve and the</font>

20
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,750
idea is that you sort of start here and

21
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,659
work your way around and eventually you

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,310
fill up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole space and if you need</font>

23
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:13,320
sort of more points you can for example

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,689
go to a fifth-order Hilbert curve and

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,850
you get you get it gets denser but it it

26
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:23,639
preserves<font color="#E5E5E5"> properties of grouping and and</font>

27
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:25,289
fractal nature and everything so I've

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,630
got sort of a pseudo animation here that

29
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,009
shows you the layout of a Hilbert curve

30
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,479
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of step through these one</font>

31
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:36,030
at a time the the numbers represent the

32
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:40,710
first octet of an ipv4 address in the

33
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:48,290
map so this is 0 / 8 there's 1 / 8 and

34
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:48,289
so on and so it goes like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

35
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:56,240
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through all</font>

36
00:01:53,330 --> 00:02:04,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them one by one here's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next chunk</font>

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:07,940
and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter 56 /</font>

38
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:10,539
eights in the ipv4 address space and and

39
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:16,070
the color represents the color is

40
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:19,040
relative to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number obviously I'm</font>

41
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,890
going to back up a little bit and make

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,590
one more point clear so here's here's

43
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:29,059
this there's a / 8 sized chunk there's a

44
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:31,820
/ 7 sized chunk there's a / 6 here's a /

45
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,010
5 so what's nice about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this map is that</font>

46
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:38,720
site of prefixes are always squares or

47
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:42,560
rectangles there's a / for / 3 / to / 10

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:46,700
on this little<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture shows the address</font>

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:52,930
space in the map colored by the old pre

50
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,929
cider nomenclatures so plus ABCD and E

51
00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:00,650
this picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first data set that</font>

52
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:05,030
I actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> visualized using using the</font>

53
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:07,400
software this is represents the

54
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:11,510
locations of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Open DNS resolvers in a</font>

55
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,370
survey done by John Kristoff and so he

56
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,230
made his data set available to me and

57
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,830
some others and I was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> curious to</font>

58
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,970
see you know how it how it looked so

59
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,800
whipped up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> software and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what</font>

60
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,680
I came up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I realized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at this</font>

61
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,840
level it's really hard to see so I have

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,090
a sort of but here's a zoom in section

63
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,970
on some some ripe address space and you

64
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,140
can see different patterns and you know

65
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,720
different blocks have different

66
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:39,980
characteristics like you know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

67
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:45,050
most part the dark blue represents about

68
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:46,459
one address open in that / 24 the

69
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,530

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:56,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">into these lighter blues we're talking</font>

72
00:03:49,730 --> 00:04:00,260
thirty forty percent and so on and

73
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,670
here's a another map this is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> route</font>

74
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,540

vgp snapshot taken about a month or so

76
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:11,239
ago and here the color represents the

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,958
size of an announcement in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the writing</font>

79
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,700
stands out is as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

80
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:25,969

81

allocations<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron ap Nick and so on</font>

83
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,690
here's a lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> early class be in it</font>

84
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,000
and it just looks a lot different here's

85
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,889
there's the old<font color="#CCCCCC"> Class C space I'm going</font>

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:44,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to zoom in on one section to highlight</font>

00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:48,790
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is obviously 15 16 12</font>

88
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:51,740
and 17 but you can see for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

89
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,840
the in this visual visualization shows

90
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,280
that different prefixes in the

91
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,260
writing-table overlap so for example the

92
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,030
purple represents something like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> slash</font>

93
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,389
a denouncement and then the blues and

94
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,638
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> greens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are more specific routes and</font>

95
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:12,289
obviously 18t has a lot of very specific

96
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:14,750
routes in the table here's a yet another

97
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:20,030
map that uses who is data to generate

98
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:23,600
the colors and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that's sort</font>

99
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,650
of interesting about this is like I

100
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,860
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it shows up on that screen</font>

101
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:30,880
whoops<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this is kind of a brown area</font>

102
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:35,510
that comes about from combination of

103
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,800
this space being listed in multiple rir

104
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:41,710
who is databases<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think in this case</font>

105
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,710
it's aaron and ripe

106
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:52,679
this picture is from from the census

107
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,139
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recently published and has</font>

milliseconds from is I to their targets

111
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:12,090
just yet another<font color="#E5E5E5"> way of looking at these</font>

112
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:13,440
types of data sets so as I said in doing

113
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,700
this work I you know at first<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought</font>

114
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,780
I was being early clever and unique and

115
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,070
I would be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first one to do this but</font>

116
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,070
of course that's never the case and

117
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,280
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs point to people that are</font>

118
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently doing the same thing or have</font>

119
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,869
already<font color="#CCCCCC"> done the same thing that the</font>

120
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,850
first one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tech report from</font>

121
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,010
Pennsylvania that came out in 2005 and

122
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,830
they have some visualizations using this

123
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:37,979
T visual visualizations of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp data</font>

124
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,889
using that technique and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the monkey org</font>

125
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:42,360
URL is interesting because they've put

126
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:45,450
the data into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the google maps interface</font>

127
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,830
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> zoom in and you can type in</font>

128
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:50,789
your IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and it'll it'll put up a</font>

129

little flag or your IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address is is I</font>

130
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:54,630
mentioned they've used the same

131
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:59,240
technique and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we recently published</font>

132
00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:02,460
their data there's a couple others there

133
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,110
there's a URL where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can you can</font>

134
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:08,070
download the source code for this you

135
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:09,510
can browse some full size images which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

136
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,010
highly recommend because they don't come

137
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">out very well on this screen here and</font>

138
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,969
there's also some animations and if I

139
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,560
have time and there's no questions I

140
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,900
have an animation that I could maybe

141
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,990
show on the screen how much time do we

142
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,260
have are there any<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions or should I</font>
