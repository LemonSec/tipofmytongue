00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,160
other providers and who have a legacy

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,678
infrastructure in place and they have

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,990
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> just providing IP services so they</font>

have come a long way and and that IP

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,740
services is not something they would

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drastically change and make it</font>

8

as an MPLS core to provide some of these

labels services so they would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

10

use the existing infrastructure that

quite transparent for enabling any new

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,390
services now from an MPLS based core

21
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,579
that that exists<font color="#CCCCCC"> today these kind of</font>

22
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,140
services are enabled and the same feel

23
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,530
is is what is required when I have a

24
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,020
plane IP core<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have NE mpls or</font>

25
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,640
anything in my core networks it is just

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing an IP lookup and forwarding and</font>

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,880
and pretty much most of the routers are

28
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,350
meant to do that and bringing in an MPLS

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,210
switching functionality to it was

30
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,500
something from<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a hardware</font>

31
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,390
perspective from an implementation

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,030
perspective brought in a lot of

33
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,299
challenges for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the vendors but</font>

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,860
IP routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's worth</font>

36
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,590
utilizing that capability and bring in

37
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,200
these these additional services and and

38
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,140
another viewers we had multiple

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,479
backbones you know the IP IP core and

40
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,610
and we used just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP core for our</font>

41
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,450
internet access and we built in another

42
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:42,000
core we said oh this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be my</font>

43
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:44,250
idiom based or it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be my you</font>

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,110
know label label based networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

45
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,670
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be better if I can have a</font>

46
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,439
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network which could be just a</font>

47
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,119
plain vanilla IP and integrate all of

48
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,000
these services so what we call as a

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,549
converged common IP backbone that that

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,530
view actually it kind of brings in

51
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,509
little bit less overhead for thee for

52
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,909
the provider because he is looking at

53
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:04,560
one single<font color="#CCCCCC"> network earlier it was all</font>

54
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">spread across for providing multiple</font>

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,009
different services now he's in a

56
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,069
position where he can combine all of

57
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,749
this together now I say

58
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:15,388
simplify network operations but I I

59
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:17,400
believe you you guys doing it on a daily

60
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:20,670
basis so it's not as simple as it sounds

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,680
it has its own challenges but one

62
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,328
variable we are eliminating there is I

63
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">think from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and from a knowledge base or</font>

64
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:27,870
from an expertise perspective I think

65
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,930
we're we have been doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> well with with</font>

66
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,799
IP and bringing in mpls into the play we

67
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,299
we are kind of added an extra layer of

68
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:38,819
knowledge that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the maintenance folks</font>

69
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:41,099
would be requiring now that is somewhat

70
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:43,649
we are minimizing here but still there

71
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:45,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the concepts you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still demand a</font>

72
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,609
good knowledge knowledge knowledge base

73
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:49,048
now when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talk about security</font>

74
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:52,379
infrastructure for service integration

75
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:54,239
so here it's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a belief that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

76
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:57,569
know once once I have an IP core I'm

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,269
prone to lot of attacks and it's very

78
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:01,708
risky to have a plain IP core<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

79
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:03,930
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some kind of an encryption</font>

80
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:06,959
built into it or some kind of a secured

81
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,599
mechanism built into it so so keeping

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,689
that in mind there are there are various

83
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,819
ways one can achieve that because with

84
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:16,680
the MPLS core we always used to say that

85
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,659
we have a domain where we are allocating

86
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,430
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> label so I know what I am</font>

87
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,650
allocating and what I'm expecting so

88
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,689
there is very less chances for somebody

89
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,599
attacking it very easily once it comes

90
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:29,310
to IP and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are more chances so to</font>

91
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,768
eliminate that there are techniques<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

92
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,720
are used today<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we can we can</font>

93
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,579
encapsulate the packets that are going

94
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">out in the core as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well as towards the</font>

95
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:39,900
edge in a manner that it is less prone

96
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,030
to less prone to attacks so there are

97
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:46,889
details in terms of you know how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

98
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:49,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">achieved so just to give a more detailed</font>

99
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:54,419
view of this particular concept that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

100
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:56,819
am referring here so 2547 was what we

101
00:03:54,419 --> 00:04:00,900
all are way off which was always used

102
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:04,259
for layer free VPN with MPLS based layer

103
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:08,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">3 VPNs so here that's that's absolute</font>

104
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:11,488
and we are we are having 4364 which is

105
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:13,769
what is is a common RFC that defines how

106
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,519
l3 VPN services are available today and

107
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:20,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think the same same concept is still</font>

108
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,320
used because there we are using bgp as

109
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,630
multi protocol bgp as one of the key

110
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,010
components<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to drive the</font>

111
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,469
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> two entries ability and prefix</font>

112
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,810
exchange and labeled<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP and things like</font>

113
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,260
that all that concept still<font color="#E5E5E5"> holds good</font>

114
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:36,360
even if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> using an IP core now it the</font>

115
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,250
even though i'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> LLP VPN</font>

116
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,290
services<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm I'm not differentiating</font>

117
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,480
between v4 or v6 so that's that's

118
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,860
something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in mind in all of my</font>

119
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,330
professors presentation I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font>

120
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">healthy VP and I'm I'm just assuming</font>

121
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,840
that it should be so transparent that I

122
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,450
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to forward whether it's</font>

123
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,280
v4 prefix coming in from my EDC routers

124
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,260
or it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a v6 prefix that's</font>

125
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,849
coming in from my HC routers I should be

126
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,570
able to handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

127
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:03,090
transparently and pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much most of</font>

128
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:05,190
the functionalities from from an

129
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,570
implementation perspective as well as

130
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,969
from a deployment perspective I think

131
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">with whatever we learned from MPLS based</font>

132
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,850
core it's still very much holds good

133
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,920
with an IP core there has not been a

134
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,250
major changes but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that key</font>

135
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,830
factors that that is there today is two

136
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,560
approaches so one is MGR you can also

137
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,740
the multi-point GRE tunnels that's one

138
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,330
mechanism of encapsulating an IP packet

139
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,870
within a with the GRE header and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

140
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,030
use my regular 4364 standards features

141
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist and transport my packet over</font>

142
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,299
the network that's one mother there's

143
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,480
another option which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we call</font>

144
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,850
using l2tp v3 so layer two tunneling

145
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,980
protocol has been there all<font color="#CCCCCC"> along</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

146
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,630
it's not something new weekly has been

147
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,460
enhancements that has been added<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

148
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:53,190
what it brings in is brings in a

149
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:56,669
flexibility in forwarding this<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP an IP</font>

150
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:59,190
kind of a concept for l3 VPN services so

151
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,230
so my focus of this discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is</font>

152
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,840
going to be mainly with respect to l2tp

153
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:06,600
v3 tunneling mechanism because that's

154
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,890
something something unique and it's it i

155
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,740
will talk about the advantage is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

156
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:13,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it brings in so MGR is is another</font>

157
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,090
option which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is which is also again</font>

158
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:20,150
widely accepted but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will focus on the</font>

159
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:23,849
l2tp be three part so when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

160
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,679
tunneling so always you know the concept

161
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,440
comes oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to define a tunnel and</font>

162
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,570
that tunnel has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> span across all</font>

163
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,419
the pease that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the router and</font>

164
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:35,280
that's an overhead from a service

165
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,139
provider perspective because now he has

166
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font>

167
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,340
manually configure each of these tunnels

168
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,050
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wherever the traffic needs to be</font>

169
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,508
destined he has to force the traffic to

170
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,580
go over the tunnel now<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I have a site</font>

171
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:49,219
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> having twenty thousand</font>

172
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,810
locations worldwide and imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

173
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:52,520
complexity that the service provider has

174
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,529
to do with if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are talking about doing</font>

175
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,599
a static tunneling configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

176
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:58,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">so what this talks about is using the</font>

177
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:02,330
BGP capabilities where I can define a

178
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:04,610
single tunnel on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1pe which can be</font>

179
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,229
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to all the multiple peas</font>

180
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">that exist in the network because I'm</font>

181
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:10,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">already doing an ibgp peering in my</font>

182
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,490
regular l3 VPN where I do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

183
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:15,620
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ibgp pairing between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pease so already</font>

184
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,479
I am doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I which be appearing now all</font>

185
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">I need to do is an additional capability</font>

186
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,830
of exchanging this tunnel information

187
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:23,569
that I am configuring my PE routers and

188
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:26,029
that can be exchanged across all my

189
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:27,469
pease now that's what this this bloody

190
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,110
is talking about instead manually

191
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:32,089
configuring all the tunnels I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

192
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:34,580
relying very much on bgp to do the next

193
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:36,560
stop reach ability for my tunnels now

194
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,349
the packets that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out</font>

195
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,779
from my PE the ingress PE is going to be

196
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:44,240
encapsulated with l2tp v3 so the next

197
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:46,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">few slides goes by in detail as step</font>

198
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,719
step by step operation as to how this is

199
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:49,250
achieved so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through some</font>

200
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:52,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this here but we will go through in</font>

201
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,139
detail in following slides so there is

202
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:56,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">something called as a session ID and a</font>

203
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:58,639
cookie value so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know</font>

204
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,979
encrypting or protecting the packet that

205
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,389
goes out on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire so session ID and</font>

206
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:05,000
cookie are one of the parameters that

207
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:07,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">exist in an l2tp v3 header so if i'm</font>

208
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,080
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to encapsulate a packet coming in</font>

209
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:11,569
from my<font color="#CCCCCC"> c router to go too much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my core</font>

210
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,250
routers I'm encapsulating l2tp v3 header

211
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:16,039
so that has this cookie in session

212
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,719
session ID values this cookie<font color="#CCCCCC"> value is</font>

213
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,969
something that is exchanging between my

214
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:22,430
peers so I would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> told my</font>

215
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:23,750
neighboring<font color="#CCCCCC"> p router that this is the</font>

216
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,879
cookie value that you're supposed to

217
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,949
expect from all the packets that I send

218
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,139
it to you now when the packet reaches to

219
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:32,449
the remote PE he will do a lookup and he

220
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:33,890
will match<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay these the packet coming</font>

221
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:36,260
with the right cookie value that I have

222
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,760
been told from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> neighbor now based on</font>

223
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,110
this cookie value then I will make a

224
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,208
decision whether I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

225
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,159
packet or I should drop it now there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

226
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:45,660
it's an optional field so obviously if

227
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,949
once I have this field integrated

228
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,050
in the packet then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll it'll occupy</font>

229
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:51,000
the space as a as a packet that is going

230
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,979
out on the wire so the packet size will

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">be looking as bigger but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be</font>

232
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,220
varied in a sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can have a zero</font>

233
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,259
white cookie or a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2-byte cookie or four</font>

234
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,089
byte or an<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 x cookies those things are</font>

235
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,920
configurable parameters you know so one

236
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:04,199
can as an end user we could configure

237
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,149
this and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok let's let's have an</font>

238
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:08,099
8-byte cookie as a standard in my entire

239
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,079
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 4-byte cookie as a standard</font>

240
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,110
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> net one network depending upon how</font>

241
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:15,959
how how susceptible the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

242
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,569
and there is another additional details

243
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:20,790
in terms of Y key what cookie value as a

244
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:22,649
static between pe1 and PE to make it

245
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,779
more dynamic means make it more all roll

246
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:26,279
over every periodically every three

247
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,500
hours once or five hours once or 10

248
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:30,660
hours once make it make it change so

249
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,879
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the neighbors are updated with new</font>

250
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">your cookie values so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

251
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,470
details on that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP is what I I refer</font>

252
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:39,870
here is being used as a standard to

253
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:43,829
exchange this end cap better information

254
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:48,180
from one PE to another PE so this is

255
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is how how how the overall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

256
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:52,739
would look like so you would you would

257
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,209
have at the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the flyer you</font>

258
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,730
could see there is an IP transport

259
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:58,979
network so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a network which would</font>

260
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,470
would like to have l3 VPN services or v6

261
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,089
services enabled on this so we would

262
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,620
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these these three boxes that we are</font>

263
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:06,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">showing here can be considered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as PE</font>

264
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,029
routers the provider edge routers and

265
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,310
they are as a there is an igp running

266
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:13,709
internally so obviously you know how to

267
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:16,170
reach each other and that's doing a

268
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:18,779
regular IP IP lookup r.i.p transport is

269
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,370
what exists now on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is what</font>

270
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:22,290
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are calling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it as a tunnel overlay</font>

271
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,930
multi access network so what that I what

272
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:28,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">that means is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am going to define one</font>

273
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,819
static tunnel on my edge routers on all

274
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:32,130
of them you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see a small boxes there</font>

275
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:34,050
so they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much one tunnel that</font>

276
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have d-sub defined and I am NOT</font>

277
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,589
indicating who will be my source and

278
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:39,569
destination for that animal sources

279
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:42,000
derived from BGP so BGP would know that

280
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:43,889
the loopback idea of the PE is the

281
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,139
source for this tunnel but destination

282
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:47,759
is not defined for this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> every PE</font>

283
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,040
would be exchanging this tunnel

284
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,860
information so each one knows who is the

285
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,849
other tunnel so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no specific</font>

286
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,790
destination IP addresses for<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

287
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,819
tunnels now from from from the way it

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,738
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tunnel network will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

comes from you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remote seas</font>

292
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:09,169
and it comes to the local PE now once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

293
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:11,539
do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lookup and I'm supposed to</font>

294
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:13,759
forward the packet to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the core now that</font>

295
00:11:11,539 --> 00:11:16,369
responsibility of redirecting this

296
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,529
packet to go over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunnel is coming</font>

297
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:20,509
from this multi access network now the

298
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:22,699
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom diagram that we have which is</font>

299
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:24,919
IP transport is mainly responsible for

300
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:27,108
reach ability between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PE s so p1 to</font>

301
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:29,449
p2 how to get to is what this IP

302
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:31,999
transport provides whereas traffic from

303
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:33,799
once EE to another<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cee how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I reach</font>

304
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:38,689
that that information is provided by the

305
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:40,549
tunnel overlay Network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so going</font>

306
00:11:38,689 --> 00:11:42,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit in detail so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have few</font>

307
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:44,149
slides which further talks about a

308
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,618
comparison with the gendrich

309
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:47,539
terminologies and details that we

310
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:49,639
already aware of from an l-3 VPN MPLS

311
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:52,369
based so here what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am referring</font>

312
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,049
about is a packet that came in from a

313
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:56,509
customer router to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider router</font>

314
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:58,160
and I am doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look up and I'm now</font>

315
00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:00,739
supposed to send this packet to my next

316
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,089
hop or a remote see router now to do

317
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:04,249
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what are the additional things</font>

318
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:06,289
that's that's being done so the lookup

319
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:09,169
is done and that would tell me who is my

320
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:11,419
next hop PE now once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know the next up</font>

321
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:13,339
heeey I now had to redirect this packet

322
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:15,379
to go over with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tunnel now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

323
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:17,600
packet that goes out now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be</font>

324
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:19,309
looking something like this so if you

325
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,409
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the top it's called as a</font>

326
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:23,509
tunnel IP it is nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but a 20-wide</font>

327
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:25,459
header and there is a protocol ID which

328
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:27,379
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we call the l2tp v3 protocol ID</font>

329
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:29,089
and then the source IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

330
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">destination IP address so the first</font>

331
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:32,419
source IP address and destination IP

332
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:35,389
address here it refers to the reach

333
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:37,189
ability of the PE s so the PE one is

334
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:39,739
these where is my source IP address and

335
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:41,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">PE to the Lubec idea of PE 2 is where</font>

336
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:42,769
I'm supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach that's the</font>

337
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:44,839
destination IP address of the remote

338
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:46,549
router now the session idea and cookie I

339
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,589
just explained I'll go through that in

340
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:50,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">detail and then there is this label</font>

341
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:52,309
information so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP worth</font>

342
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,309
label this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is again asked for the</font>

343
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:57,978
regular bgp extensions that the labels

344
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:59,809
were exchanged<font color="#CCCCCC"> between p1 and p2 for the</font>

345
00:12:57,979 --> 00:13:02,479
customer prefix that's the label that

346
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:04,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm imposing and at the bottom is where</font>

347
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:06,799
is my customers payload so if you look

348
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:08,140
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> customer's payload bgp</font>

349
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,540
label then there is an l2

350
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">together in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the tunnel IP now as this</font>

351
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,280
packet goes to the core routers pretty

352
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,600
much the lookup is done on this top

353
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,459
header which is what I'm calling as a

354
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,990
tunnel I be so the lookup is done on

355
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,910
source IP address and destination IP

356
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,850
address and I just switch the packets

357
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,620
based on the top tunnel IP header now

358
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:29,310
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> it reaches</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the remote destination</font>

359
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,840
which is my<font color="#CCCCCC"> fee to as an endpoint that</font>

360
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:33,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">when i do the lookup i come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know that</font>

361
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,160
that packet belongs to me and i do a

362
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,839
further look up into<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to look into</font>

363
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">the label and then to the forwarding to</font>

364
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,840
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> es PE routers so this is what</font>

365
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,820
exactly we see when a packet leaves from

366
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:51,220
an ingress PE routers going towards the

367
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:54,010
egress PE routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so a little bit</font>

368
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,450
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of this particular payload</font>

369
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,270
here which I talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the l2tp v3</font>

370
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:00,190
header part so here if you see the the

371
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,800
session ID and cookie values is a part

372
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:05,560
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> l2tp v3 header and so cookie you</font>

373
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,109
I field is around a 64 bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it is</font>

374
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it's a value that is associated for</font>

375
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,530
every data packet that in going to send

376
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,260
out to the remote PE and it is

377
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,970
associated with the session ID now the

378
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,600
cookie values as I said it is a variable

379
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:21,280
values means it's it's an optional some

380
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">its exchange as a part of my bgp updates</font>

381
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:27,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">or why am I multi-protocol</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp and that</font>

382
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:31,330
40 bytes or four bytes or eight bytes is

383
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:33,760
again depends upon how how how

384
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,800
protective I am of my network obviously

385
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,300
once i have an 8-byte your your

386
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,250
appointee use of the use of your

387
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">resources in the network but pretty much</font>

388
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">this this brings in more advantageous</font>

389
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,000
because now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 64 bit random value</font>

390
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:48,280
now to guess the 64 bit random value for

391
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,830
any any attacker it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a big</font>

392
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:53,020
challenge hence most of the most of the

393
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,090
providers do go with eight byte as the

394
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,310
cookie value another parameter which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

395
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">said earlier was the cookie roll over i</font>

396
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,459
think that's that's one of the one of

397
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the key items that that exists today</font>

398
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:05,110
where these cookie values need not have

399
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be statically configured so these are</font>

400
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,670
once i define a tunnel on my PE router a

401
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,589
local cookie value is generated and it

402
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:14,260
is exchanged across all my networks and

403
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">i can need not have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep that value</font>

404
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,700
constant<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can configure parameters</font>

405
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:21,290
which is called as cookie<font color="#CCCCCC"> rollover where</font>

406
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">i could configure it saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok after</font>

407
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,699
I ours do the cookie<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll over right so</font>

408
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,529
then the cookie roll over happens and

409
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:30,290
the every PE is now exchanged its new

410
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,820
cookie values so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something which</font>

411
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,009
is which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is widely accepted because we</font>

412
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,100
don't want to keep a standard fixed

413
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:39,709
cookie values so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a bullet</font>

414
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,509
here a marked honestly I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

415
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:43,250
the leads who has presented a lot of

416
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:46,100
details when this l2tp v3 in previous

417
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,170
presentations he talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how how how</font>

418
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,269
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> years it would take for somebody to</font>

419
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:52,839
guess a 64-bit cookie value if that

420
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:55,550
packet goes on to the art of the network

421
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide would be the</font>

422
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,959
best one to give you give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a detail</font>

423
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,389
as to what what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been talking about</font>

424
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,609
so comparing the pretty much to the

425
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:06,529
regular mpls as a transport that exists

426
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,589
today most of them are using this

427
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:12,470
mechanism where mpls which while DP or

428
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:15,860
RSVP is enabled in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the core and now this</font>

429
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:18,440
diagram talks about three PE routers so

430
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,990
PE a PB and maybe the top one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> PE ce</font>

431
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you have these edge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> siiii routers</font>

432
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:26,089
which are which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where our enterprise</font>

433
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:28,010
customers are home to and now there are

434
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:31,760
colors associated with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope you</font>

435
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:34,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys can see that so CEA and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ceb being</font>

436
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,279
as they are part of the same same

437
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:40,430
enterprise or the same site now what

438
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,860
what this would require here is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

439
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:45,979
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an LSP that has been already</font>

440
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:48,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">established between PE and PE be so this</font>

441
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">is how in an MPLS Network we would have</font>

442
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:53,810
an LSP<font color="#E5E5E5"> HC established between p and p EV</font>

443
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:55,430
and now using that LSP that is basically

444
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,439
used for me to achieve the reach ability

445
00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:00,680
between PE and peb and provide the label

446
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,199
path along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have PE and PE be</font>

447
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,879
in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> MPI bgp sessions so there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

448
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,399
IBG possession that runs between these

449
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:10,010
and which is responsible for carrying my

450
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,980
customer prefixes the prefixes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> CEA</font>

451
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:16,369
has sent to be EA and now that needs to

452
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:18,650
be forwarded to<font color="#E5E5E5"> PE be now multi protocol</font>

453
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:21,319
bgp would be doing this use as a part of

454
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,510
VPN be four or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a VPN v6 address</font>

455
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:26,059
exchanges so those prefixes would be

456
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:30,049
reaching to the remote PE now that that

457
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:32,809
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're learning the routes from cee</font>

458
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:34,430
and forwarding those routes as a part of

459
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:36,649
MP bgp to the remote see

460
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:38,270
all that part still remains<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same so</font>

461
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's what I'm calling it as untouched</font>

462
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,410
in a sense if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> using an IP core today</font>

463
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,090
that functionality would still remain

464
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,550
the same there is there is no difference

465
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:50,689
whether it's an MPLS score as an IP core

466
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:52,550
now what needs to be changed is let me

467
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,770
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit on the MPLS part of it</font>

468
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:58,310
so if a traffic now I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

469
00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:01,280
traffic from cea to seee be so packet

470
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:02,840
comes to peña now I do a look up to to

471
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,450
figure out where I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send this</font>

472
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,790
packet the next hub for that packet I

473
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,370
already know why I bgp so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

474
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:11,990
forward that packet to peb now now when

475
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:14,179
the packet is supposed to go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

476
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:16,790
case of mpls transport<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would be</font>

477
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:19,370
imposing<font color="#E5E5E5"> an igp label that is a label to</font>

478
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:21,500
reach the next hop p next stop router in

479
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,360
the path or along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to</font>

480
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">impose what we call the bgp label or the</font>

481
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,870
word flavor so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the label that</font>

482
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:30,110
the peb would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking up and</font>

483
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:31,639
forwarding the packet to ceb now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need</font>

484
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">to change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that because I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font>

485
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,320
any mpls as a mechanism here I'm still

486
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,810
having an IP in my core so what I would

487
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">be doing for this case is i would be</font>

488
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:43,220
changing that and the packet will be

489
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,990
encapsulated within l2tp v3 header so

490
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,210
the one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I showed in previous slide</font>

491
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:50,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is what is the packet that PE a</font>

492
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:52,160
would be sending it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> peb so the packet</font>

493
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,550
that goes out from peña would look like

494
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,560
it's having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a source IP address as PE a</font>

495
00:18:54,550 --> 00:19:00,200
destination IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses peb that is</font>

496
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,909
going to be in the top tunnel IP in the

497
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,290
previous slide which we saw and then

498
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,450
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a session</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ID and cookie value</font>

499
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:07,220
which is already been exchanged and then

500
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,590
i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bgp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Wharf label which is</font>

501
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,330
exactly same as what in mpls transport

502
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:14,899
case as well and then comes the customer

503
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:16,370
table so so that's what I mean mind by

504
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,500
saying untouched in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first part</font>

505
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,209
because that's the regular MP bgp

506
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,250
mechanism it has nothing to do with

507
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,530
whether i use mpls transporter<font color="#CCCCCC"> an IV</font>

508
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,810
transport only change would be is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

509
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:30,649
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward the packet going out from</font>

515
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:46,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">exchange the customer prefixes between</font>

resolves the customer pro fixes within

523
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,150
the work table and it would impose an

igp label with the VPN label and a

00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:11,549

upon the configuration and the network

537
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:33,299

be<font color="#CCCCCC"> knowing the label look up because</font>

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:47,220
flow which is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> with respect to</font>

the MPLS based core now similarly<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

547
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,630
we're mighty routers are my core up

regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP that is present today then</font>

550
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,950
what would be the difference so the

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,360
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a BGP</font>

552
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,159
perspective I would have done all the

553
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,649
initial work of exchanging the customer

554
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:09,630
prefixes and the labels<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp label that</font>

555
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,940
is associated to it that part still

556
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,890
remains<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same ingress ve can reach</font>

557
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,750
the egress PE through the IP core

558
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:17,820
because i have an igp that is running<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

559
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:20,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">i know the reach ability now only</font>

560
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,889
additional difference that here that the

561
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,480
ingress PE has to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where ingress p</font>

562
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:28,080
has to now resolve these customer

563
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,419
prefixes and point to an l2tp v3 tunnel

564
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,158
now that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the additional difference</font>

565
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:34,110
that you could see which was not

566
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,840
existing in the case of in the MPLS

567
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:40,049
score so ingress PE would now would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

568
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,030
putting an<font color="#E5E5E5"> l2tp v3 pack a header on top</font>

569
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:44,010
of the customer IP packet that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

570
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,200
forwarding it so the ingress be you

571
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:48,270
would impose<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunnel IP or l2tp v3 header</font>

572
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,549
plus the vpm label plus the customer

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunnel so so the packet that is</font>

575
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:57,299
going out now we'll be looking something

576
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:58,290
like the tunnel I<font color="#CCCCCC"> p+ VPN label</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plus</font>

578
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:02,070
as the traffic moves along now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

584
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:16,350
doing a standard IP lookup because my

585
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,750

586
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:20,820
20-wide IP header which has the IP

587
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,860
address off from where the source packet

588
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,290
came in and it has the destination<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

589
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,270
address of the egress PE now it knows

00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,580
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reach the egress PE so that look</font>

591

609
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,760
use my existing IP capable p routers

that existed for forwarding regular

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">just use the same and and it will be a</font>

regular IP lookup for these<font color="#CCCCCC"> P routers</font>

615
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,530
now on the once the packet reaches the

00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,510
egress<font color="#CCCCCC"> v router now this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is where the</font>

617
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:29,490
lookup will be done and that will tell

00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,830
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this particular packet belongs</font>

619
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:34,800
to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the destination IP address</font>

620
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:37,260

00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,149
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this the additional two</font>

622
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,430
important things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has to do is it</font>

623
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,080
has to verify is the session ID and the

624
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:46,140
cookie values these were what I had

625
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,929
exchanged as a part of my bgp session

626
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,790
exchange so as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would go</font>

627
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:53,310
and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the packet that I got</font>

628
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:55,350
is matching the cookie and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> session</font>

629
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:57,929
ID that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had received earlier as a part</font>

630
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:00,300
of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp exchange if that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matches goes</font>

631
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,680
through then which we call i'm calling

632
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,169
it as an admittance admittance check

633
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,480
here so if it matches then only I will

634
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:08,250
go and further look into the packet if

635
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,380
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a discrepancy here if I got a</font>

636
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,059
spoof packet and it has a cookie value

637
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,950
which is not

638
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:16,129
matching with what i was told earlier i

639
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:18,529
will drop those packets now once this

640
00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:20,059
cookie<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a she once these packets are</font>

641
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:22,309
matched all of this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font>

642
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:25,039
further look up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> find out what is</font>

643
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:26,809
this vgp label so based on the label

644
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,460
look up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would know which is the egress</font>

645
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:31,039
interface I am forwarding the traffic to

646
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,809
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is what is the last couple of</font>

647
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">blurts here it talks about so the bgp</font>

648
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:36,918
lake label look up would result in a war

649
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:40,399
and its associated outgoing interfaces

650
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:42,230
now tunnel IP l2tp v3 header and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

651
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:43,998
label since<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done all of this i</font>

652
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,950
would be stripping off all of this and

653
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:47,360
now i am left with an IP packet which is

654
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,809
what it's supposed to be forwarded to

655
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,639
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> egress see a router now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

656
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:54,619
slides further actually this this

657
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:58,248
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide would would explain all</font>

658
00:24:54,619 --> 00:25:01,100
of this in detail so so this this slide

659
00:24:58,249 --> 00:25:04,279
kind of gives a summary as what i was

660
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:06,080
talking all along so in an encapsulation

661
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:08,240
behavior so what I'm saying here is on

662
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,158
the ingress ve where I'm supposed to

663
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,769
encapsulate this packet which is going

664
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,049
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my IP core I would be doing a</font>

665
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:17,090
simple IP packet look up because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

666
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:19,399
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from my customer customer site</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

667
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:21,230
do an IP lookup and I and that

668
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:23,449
destination of that packet tells me

669
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:26,869
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the egress PE I am supposed to</font>

670
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:29,149
go and since I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the egress PE now i</font>

671
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:31,490
am supposed to put a l2tp v3 header to

672
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:33,889
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would be associating a VPN label</font>

673
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,990
and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunnel end cap or the l2tp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> v3n cap</font>

674
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:39,019
to it and then I forward this packet out

675
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:41,509
to my core now on the decaf solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

676
00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:43,669
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got the packet I do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lookup on</font>

677
00:25:41,509 --> 00:25:45,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the tunnel IP that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tells me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

678
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:47,960
packet belongs to the egress<font color="#E5E5E5"> PE itself</font>

679
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:50,269
and then it does the admittance check

680
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,549
for session ID and cookie and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

681
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:54,649
would forward the packet based on the

682
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:56,779
label look up that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

683
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:58,939
allocated so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how our</font>

684
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:00,499
typical flow happens from an end to end

685
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,090
from an encapsulation behavior in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

686
00:26:00,499 --> 00:26:05,389
capsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> site you know in a service</font>

687
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:07,039
for our network now the core routers are

688
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:11,049
transparent to this they are doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

689
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,549
regular IP forwarding in an IEP looker

690
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:15,889
so here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this this</font>

691
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:18,049
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide will kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of goes</font>

692
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:20,059
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more in detail and kind of</font>

693
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:21,860
reiterate the same same same information

694
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:23,360
that I was passing along so if you look

695
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">at there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are two parts to this network</font>

696
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,719
so

697
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:29,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">p1 p2 p3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the real PE routers which</font>

698
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">exist in the service powder network and</font>

699
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,879
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of at the bottom I am talking about</font>

700
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:34,919
the IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so what I am referring</font>

701
00:26:32,879 --> 00:26:36,449
there is it just kind of gives you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

702
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,220
view of how the reach ability that

703
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:39,869
exists for these fees i might have

704
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,879
multiple p routers in the middle or

705
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:43,949
multiple pops to reach my egress PE

706
00:26:41,879 --> 00:26:45,269
routers I know the reachability effort

707
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,830
so that's what the fast bowler talks

708
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:49,649
about the remote end point is routable

709
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:52,649
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP so PE one knows how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

710
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:54,600
to p2 or p3 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like that now</font>

711
00:26:52,649 --> 00:26:56,279
once once i know that i would have

712
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,789
configured what i call as a tunnel or a

713
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:02,039
tunnel template on p1 and p2 and p3 and

714
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:04,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">once I have this tunnel define now</font>

715
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:07,499
that's what I'm exchanging between my I

716
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">btp sessions between all these pease so</font>

717
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:11,100
as a part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I bgp session exchange</font>

718
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,139
I am exchanging the session ID and the

719
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,389
cookie values and at all so I know the

720
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:17,039
reach ability of each of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> pease now</font>

721
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:18,869
that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the second part and</font>

722
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,570
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third one would be is I got</font>

723
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:23,999
prefixes from my customer sites on to my

724
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:27,480
PE one I would be forwarding those

725
00:27:23,999 --> 00:27:29,549
traffic those prefixes why am I bgp

726
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,980
which could be a VPN v4 route exchange

727
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:33,779
or a VPN v6 address-family route

728
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,659
exchange<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would be forwarding those</font>

729
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:38,909
prefixes from PE one to say pe2 or PA

730
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:43,649
three depending upon from which site all

731
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:45,779
of this belongs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so similarly so p III</font>

732
00:27:43,649 --> 00:27:49,529
would be receiving VPN will be receiving

733
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:51,570
VPN v4 and v6 yr bgp so this slide is

734
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:53,309
kind of giving you<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a control plane</font>

735
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:55,320
perspective so what I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there is</font>

736
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:58,649
no forwarding involved here how the

737
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:01,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">end-to-end setup is varied once once the</font>

738
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:03,658
forwarding starts happening now this one

739
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:05,970
is it clearly demonstrate that there is

740
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:07,919
no mpls in the core here and it is

741
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:13,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty straightforward to to get this</font>

742
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:15,179
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> this no setup as well so from a I</font>

743
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:18,179
think this slide just use go ahead and

744
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:19,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">use an example typically how in a</font>

745
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:22,470
service for a network today it is done

746
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,909
so the slide to the left I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

747
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,399
left side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slide you talk about</font>

748
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:29,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">ce1 talking to PE</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one and there are core</font>

749
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:33,928
p routers and then there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a PE</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two and</font>

750
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:34,820
then there is ce2 so c 1 to p 1 is where

751
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:37,130
my

752
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:40,129
customers access links are terminating

753
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:42,169
and I would be I would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> running the</font>

754
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:44,000
regular protocols that that I've

755
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:47,059
supported I<font color="#E5E5E5"> either it could be bgp or</font>

756
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,289
ospf or rape or static or if it is v6

757
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,779
there's another set of protocols that

758
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:55,070
are supported so that's what I'm running

759
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:58,009
from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> p12 ce1 and the prefixes like 150</font>

760
00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:00,529
to 12 at 40 / 24 as one of the prefixes

761
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:03,679
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> siiii</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is advertising will be</font>

762
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:07,159
now installed at<font color="#CCCCCC"> pe1 in one of the vrf</font>

763
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">tables I hope you you guys are aware of</font>

764
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,940
the vrf virtual routing forwarding

765
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:12,830
tables so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the tables that are</font>

766
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,990
built which are which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

767
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:17,330
configured between<font color="#CCCCCC"> pe1 and see one I</font>

768
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:20,059
would have defined a<font color="#CCCCCC"> brf interface and</font>

769
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:22,340
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it as a unique means for all</font>

770
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:24,110
my all the other customers who are home

771
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same pe1 I would be defining</font>

772
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,860
different vrf interfaces and the routes

773
00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:30,168
will be populated to their corresponding

774
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:33,229
tables so in this case let's say it's

775
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:35,330
vrf one that is where all these prefixes

776
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:38,210
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am learning from ce1 would get</font>

777
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,918
installed now from PE<font color="#CCCCCC"> one now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

778
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,590
forward these are advertised these

779
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,879
prefixes to PE to now before i do that

780
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,470
couple of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that should have</font>

781
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:47,449
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> been up and running in this</font>

782
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,529
network so one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would have</font>

783
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,789
defined the tunnels<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would have</font>

784
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:52,309
exchanged that tunnel information

785
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:54,320
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> p and p 2 already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

786
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:57,289
would have had this<font color="#CCCCCC"> address family VPN</font>

787
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,908
v4 as the capability exchange for bgp

788
00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:00,889
between p and<font color="#E5E5E5"> p e to that should have</font>

789
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:03,740
been already done and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

790
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:06,830
to p1 and p2 why am I regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

791
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:09,559
have an IP core so I'm I know how to get

792
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:11,389
to p1 and p2 through is is or ospf as a

793
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:13,190
regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP now these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things were</font>

794
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:15,529
already done by the provider and it is

795
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:18,350
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the prefixes that c1</font>

796
00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:22,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">advertise to PE</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 now gets forwarded to</font>

797
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:24,860
p you too why are the VPN be for address

798
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:26,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">extension so what this VPN v4 pretty</font>

799
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,699
much does is it kind of brings in

800
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:30,679
uniqueness to the prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font>

802
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:35,029
gonna have multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> sees so to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

803
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">unique I am associating as you look from</font>

804
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:39,320
the VPN v4 update here so you could see

805
00:30:36,889 --> 00:30:41,090
it is associating the rd value the route

806
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,120
distinguisher that is associated to

807
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:46,519
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> brf so route distinguisher colon 1</font>

808
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,469
colon 27 is this the route distinguisher

809
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:51,440
their colon 152

810
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:53,780
12 40 / 24 next stop is equal to PE 1

811
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,400
and what is the route targets and what

812
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,039
is the label value now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

813
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">information that PE 1 is advertising to</font>

814
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:03,679
PE to as a part of VPN v4 out exchange

815
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:05,720
now pe2 would install that particular

816
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,210
route into the vrf table which is

817
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,980
associated to seee to now somehow we

818
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:13,610
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get this particular prefix</font>

819
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:17,720
reach all the way from p1 to p2 via the

820
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:20,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">mpi bgp now the information that p2 got</font>

821
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,770
and installed in the work table since

822
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,780
I'm already running a routing protocol

823
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:26,510
between pe2 and see you too whatever it

824
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:28,370
may be bgp or static or rip that

825
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:32,030
particular prefixes are now advertise to

826
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:34,280
see you too so this way ce2 knows how to

827
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:36,440
get to see one from a control plane

828
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,940
perspective or from a manner where I

829
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,419
know how to get to see you too now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

830
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:43,610
matter of forwarding the traffic so this

831
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:45,350
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular slide kind of walks</font>

832
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:48,168
walks through<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it kind of gives</font>

833
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:50,030
us a view as how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will be able to</font>

834
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:54,890
forward this if I have a packet that I

835
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:56,899
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reach ce1 so 152 12 dot 4 or 6</font>

836
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:59,960
as an example is a packet that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font>

837
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:03,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">sending from ze tube and that packet</font>

838
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,600
comes to PE 2 so<font color="#CCCCCC"> P you two already has</font>

839
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:07,820
this particular prefix information in

840
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,539
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> routing table so it does a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look-up</font>

841
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:13,189
on this particular packet and now the

842
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:16,190
lookup is done in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the brf table and that</font>

843
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:20,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">would give the information to PE to that</font>

844
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:22,580
to reach 150 212 dot for dot 6 your next

845
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:24,500
hop is PE<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is already i</font>

846
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,449
installed as a part of my in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the control</font>

847
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,770
plane operation as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i explained the next</font>

848
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:29,750
stop information which we are sending

849
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:32,059
here as PE one that's what pe2 also

850
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,530
knows so<font color="#E5E5E5"> p you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two would once the lookup</font>

851
00:32:32,059 --> 00:32:37,100
tells him that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the packet is</font>

852
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:38,928
supposed to go to PE one now next step

853
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:41,000
would be is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to encapsulate this</font>

854
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:43,309
packet or what we call as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to</font>

855
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,049
rewrite this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet once it</font>

856
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:46,908
is supposed to be forwarded to my uplink

857
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:48,730
now that is where is that rewrite

858
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:51,260
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking here so where</font>

859
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:54,049
we are referring<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this is the packet</font>

860
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,640
152 12 dot for dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 this is the packet</font>

861
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:57,168
and I'm encapsulating this packet so

862
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,809
what are the things I'm encapsulating so

863
00:32:57,169 --> 00:33:02,419
the label this is the 29 is the label

864
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:04,129
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had obtained from my previous</font>

865
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:05,720
previous control pain operations slides

866
00:33:04,129 --> 00:33:09,439
that I had explained so there I have a

867
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,239
29 as the label that p1 had provided so

868
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,799
that is the label<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am imposing along</font>

869
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:15,139
with that I am imposing to other things

870
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:18,289
one is the l2tp<font color="#E5E5E5"> v3 header and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

871
00:33:15,139 --> 00:33:20,090
regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 header now this is the</font>

872
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:23,119
packet that would be traversing in my

873
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:25,730
core and once it comes to PE to now the

874
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:28,369
lookup is done only on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this top header</font>

875
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:31,340
which is my ipv4 header now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

876
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:33,559
regular ipv4 20 bite so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font>

877
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:36,320
tell is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you need to the source</font>

878
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:39,080
IP address of that is PE to destination

879
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,330
IP address of this is p 1 so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> P</font>

880
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,879
router just does a look up and through

881
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:46,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">IGP he already knows how to get to PE</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1</font>

882
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:48,859
because that's the next hop is<font color="#CCCCCC"> p1 so</font>

883
00:33:46,909 --> 00:33:50,480
this entire packet based on the IP

884
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:53,090
lookup that it did on this it will

885
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,429
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> them as it is so only change</font>

886
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:57,529
here you there is no pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much there</font>

887
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:58,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">is no change from PP to perspective all</font>

888
00:33:57,529 --> 00:34:01,850
he did was a look upon this and

889
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:04,009
forwarded the packet to p1 now at p1 he

890
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:07,668
does a look up it's a source IP address

891
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:09,589
is PE to destination IP address is<font color="#CCCCCC"> p1 I</font>

892
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:11,929
need to forward it to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hub which</font>

893
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:14,210
is PE<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 now the packet that comes here</font>

894
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:17,418
is this the whole thing comes which is

895
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:20,329
your IP that's the tunnel IP and then

896
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:22,908
you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the VPN label now the look</font>

897
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:25,190
up here would be done on this IP packet

898
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:27,290
the first look up and that look up tells

899
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:29,030
that the packet belongs to PE 1 itself

900
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,649
because the source IP address is

901
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:33,020
matching to PE 2 and session ID

902
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:35,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">addresses that the destination is IP</font>

903
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:38,119
address is matching PE 1 so this look up

904
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:40,309
now tells that it back it belongs to be

905
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:42,169
you on itself so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next step as as I</font>

906
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:44,299
explained<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next step is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

907
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:46,250
and check what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the session ID and the</font>

908
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:48,139
cookie information for this so that is

909
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,030
what this this this diagram<font color="#E5E5E5"> is referring</font>

910
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:52,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">to so if the session ID and cookie</font>

911
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:55,040
cookie values is what it had obtained

912
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:56,980
from PE<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 so it doesn't match on it and</font>

913
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,470
if there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a match the packet is</font>

914
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:01,670
further is subjected to look up if it

915
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:04,578
doesn't match it's going to drop that

916
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:06,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">packet so the lookup is done next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font>

917
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:09,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> VPN label so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the label that</font>

918
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:11,540
PE<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 had allocated and which was</font>

919
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,880
forwarded to PE 2 so p1 now does a

920
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:16,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">look-up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the label and that would in</font>

921
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,270
turn indicate that

922
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,299
the outgoing interface for this

923
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:23,610
particular packet belongs to this link

924
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:25,410
so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would remove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the label that I</font>

925
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:28,380
had allocated previously and now I

926
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:30,899
forward the regular IP packet so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

927
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:33,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the pretty much flow from from ace2</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

928
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">see e1 and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the same operation</font>

929
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,070
that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved if I have</font>

thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sites which are terminating</font>

00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,530
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be involved for every packet that</font>

934
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,720
leaves from a particular PE going

935
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:53,270
towards the particular particular of SCE

936
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:58,560
routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this this was this was a</font>

937
00:35:53,270 --> 00:36:02,700
quick view in terms of how in l3 VPN for

938
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:06,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">v4 is pretty much done using IP as a</font>

939
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:09,060
core now the same concept would still

940
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,520
hold good if I have same services I want

941
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:14,520
to enable for v6 in the sense instead of

942
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">having an ipv4 addresses or ipv4</font>

943
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,890
services that are enabled between PE 2

944
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:22,470
and c2 I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have ipv6 here so</font>

945
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:24,839
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an ipv6 cloud this is another</font>

946
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:27,390
ipv6 cloud for the same customer so that

947
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,730
means this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ce2 which was having a link</font>

948
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:32,009
to this today would like to enable ipv6

949
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:34,110
services all along<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was providing me</font>

950
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:36,450
for services and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to have v6</font>

951
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:37,920
services as well now if that needs to be

952
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:40,169
done what are the changes that are

953
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,790
involved in my service<font color="#CCCCCC"> prada network or</font>

954
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:44,130
what are the changes that are involved

955
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,440
from PE<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> c 2 is what the further</font>

956
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:48,120
for the slides talk about but one thing

957
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,070
to keep in mind is from a service

958
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">provider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective we would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

959
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:55,020
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's transparent we don't want</font>

960
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:57,629
to have an additional overhead of doing

961
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:59,460
any changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my core routers for to</font>

962
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:01,800
handle these ipv6 packets that would be

963
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:04,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">coming or I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to now switch</font>

964
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,480
from my IP core that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I exist that</font>

965
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,819
existed I don't want to switch to some

966
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,950
other some other technology so i would

967
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,960
like to still use the IP core that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

968
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,850
have and then I should be able to

969
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,220
transparently forward the ipv6 traffic

970
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:19,049
or the prefixes that I receive from each

971
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:21,120
of these sites across this network

972
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,800
that's the first requirement so that

973
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,540
means it should be the core should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

974
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,030
transparent for this and the second

975
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,990
thing would be is all the services that

976
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:31,210
i was giving on top of

977
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:32,740
this particular link for v4 so it could

978
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:35,710
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a multicast service or it could be</font>

979
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:37,868
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> qsr features that I had</font>

980
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:40,300
provided all of that should still hold

981
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:42,490
good means I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to make any</font>

982
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,260
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my network with respect to</font>

983
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:46,839
all the services that I was providing to

984
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:48,760
my customer who<font color="#E5E5E5"> was home to this link so</font>

985
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:51,850
that pretty much tells us that the PE<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2</font>

986
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,410
or these PE ones have to be v6 capable

987
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:55,180
means they should be capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of handling</font>

988
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:57,310
v6 that's coming in that's one

989
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,779
requirement and at the same time the

990
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:01,480
core router should never be dealing with

991
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:03,340
ipv6 and I don't want to change any of

992
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,780
my technologies or any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

993
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:07,540
configuration that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists in my core</font>

994
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,010
routers so with that in mind so we'll go

995
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:12,369
through the few<font color="#CCCCCC"> other slides which which</font>

996
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:14,440
talks about how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 is capable how</font>

997
00:38:12,369 --> 00:38:17,920
we can transport<font color="#E5E5E5"> the v6 prefixes from 19</font>

998
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:21,280
point to another end point so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

999
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,619
what we talked about six vpe so it's one

1000
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,110
of a kind of the terminologies that

1001
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:28,000
folks use but there are different ways

1002
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:30,850
two ways to look at it they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1003
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,160
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a simple way but we know we</font>

1004
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:35,170
know PE means once we say PE we always

1005
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,720
enters a provider edge router but we are

1006
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:40,480
calling it as a 6v PE it could have been

1007
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,549
v6p<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so we always call v6 which</font>

1008
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,980
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been a v6 PE but namitha</font>

1009
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:47,950
later<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said is six vpe so all this all</font>

1010
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:50,380
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> referring here is its l3 VPN</font>

1011
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:53,859
services for v6 so how we have been

1012
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:55,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">providing all along v4 services l3v P&V</font>

1013
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:58,240
for services now the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

1014
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for v6 so that's what</font>

1015
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,930
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is called as 6 VT so the provider</font>

1016
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:04,510
edge router which is capable of

1017
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:07,600
providing v6 services these are six vp e

1018
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:10,840
router there are multiple approaches for

1019
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,520
transporting v6 or before core but this

1020
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:14,470
is not talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> with respect to l-3 VPN</font>

1021
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,840
so these bullets are referring how<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

1022
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:20,879
transport v6 over the v4 code<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we</font>

1023
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:23,680
had a lot of discussions in the morning

1024
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,780
sessions where we talk about tunneling

1025
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,210
mechanisms and things like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1026
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,400
slide kind of gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick capture of</font>

1027
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:33,130
it where it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about how I can</font>

1028
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,350
transport be six or<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> l2 VPN</font>

1029
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:38,680
services i can easily transport a v6

1030
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:41,200
network or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a l2tp v3l to VPN</font>

1031
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,930
services enabled<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can transport v6 on</font>

1032
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,790
it or the v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> / v four tunnels I think we</font>

1033
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,740
discuss that in that session but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> key</font>

1034
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,509
thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last two bullets is what I am</font>

1035
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,000
referring as as a part of this

1036
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:55,450
discussion is how I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> achieve l3 VPN</font>

1037
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,570
services with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the using using the</font>

1038
00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:01,660
same IP core and so it comes into two

1039
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:04,060
categories one we call it as six vp e

1040
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:07,210
which is l3v p.m. basic services and the

1041
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:10,660
other one is a 6pe so slight variation

1042
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:13,660
to the six<font color="#CCCCCC"> vp e here is the six PE kind</font>

1043
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:16,990
of provides the similar kind of services

1044
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:18,279
but only difference is the customer

1045
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:20,740
prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the customers who are</font>

1046
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,200
terminated to the PE routers are not a

1047
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:27,189
part of any<font color="#CCCCCC"> brf table means it can call</font>

1048
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:30,399
it as<font color="#CCCCCC"> and v6 internet access services is</font>

1049
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:32,980
what the cpe boils down to so v6 global

1050
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,080
prefixes are now is in the PE routers

1051
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,990
and that's what is being forwarded so

1052
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:39,850
six vp is where customer enterprise

1053
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:41,859
customers are terminated<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto a provider</font>

1054
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:45,360
edge router they are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of a vrf</font>

1055
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:50,260
table and v6 prefixes have present in it

1056
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:53,680
so from a from a feature from a feature

1057
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:55,540
overview here so l3 VPN services for v6

1058
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,910
VPN customers this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i indicated</font>

1059
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:02,110
and there is an RFC which which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1060
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:04,690
talks about this so 4659 is<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

1061
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:06,610
giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> in detail about what extensions</font>

1062
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:09,820
that we have done to our regular l3v

1063
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:13,630
p.m. so l3 VPN extensions done in terms

1064
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:15,970
of mainly with respect to bgp because we

1065
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:18,700
have added<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new address family today</font>

1066
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:22,779
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we call VPN b6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

1067
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:24,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">family so for v4 we had VPN be four</font>

1068
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:27,820
address family<font color="#CCCCCC"> while</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as part of this</font>

1069
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:30,509
exchange now for v6 we have added<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new</font>

1070
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:33,460
extension<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is called the VPN v6 the</font>

1071
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:34,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">core can be mpls r.i.p as</font>

1072
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:37,690
as we have discussed and this session is

1073
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,490
mainly focusing on IP core part of it No

1074
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:42,940
Deal stacking in the core<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font>

1075
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:44,890
is the most important part because we

1076
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:48,280
never want any any changes in the

1077
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:49,930
provider network we although<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

1078
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,270
infrastructure investment has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

1079
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:54,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make sure that I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to keep</font>

1080
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:56,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">adding more stuff to the already</font>

1081
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,849
existing p router so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like to be</font>

1082
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:01,030
as transparent as possible so there is

1083
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:03,480
no v6 in the core and feature

1084
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:07,839
functionality in parity with be four so

1085
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:09,820
the not only from a from a configuration

1086
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:12,130
perspect you are for enabling these

1087
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:15,400
services pretty much from a network

1088
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:16,780
management perspective or any of the

1089
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,670
additional features that i am going to

1090
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:21,130
enable on top of this should be

1091
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:23,890
transparent so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I really don't want to</font>

1092
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:25,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a new set of you know protocols</font>

1093
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:28,270
that I've been defined just to provide

1094
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,980
v6 VPNs so feature functionality have to

1095
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:31,839
be in parity with with what we already

1096
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,760
provide so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the common</font>

1097
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:35,980
demands that any service provider would

1098
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,390
give because customers are already used

1099
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:39,070
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the services that they have a</font>

1100
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:42,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">God for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> v4 so they would like to see the</font>

1101
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:44,740
same thing available for v6 as well so

1102
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:47,919
v6 l3 VPN should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> offered or the same</font>

1103
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:49,299
be 4l three VPN infrastructure so this

1104
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">is where the dual stacking comes into</font>

1105
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:54,640
picture so what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically means is</font>

1106
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:56,529
from a from a provider edge router to

1107
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">the customer edge router I would have</font>

1108
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:00,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">had an access which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I have</font>

1109
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,560
enabled v4 and I'm providing me for

1110
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:05,410
services to it now tomorrow if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1111
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,869
provide v6 don't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to come with</font>

1112
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:09,250
another access to me so I I would like

1113
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:11,170
to use the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> access that I have been</font>

1114
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,970
provided and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to have all</font>

1115
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:16,660
the services which I have on<font color="#CCCCCC"> be4</font>

1116
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:18,399
similarly on b6 so talks in terms of I

1117
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:19,720
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have ebgp as a routing</font>

1118
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,180
protocol that i have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using all</font>

1119
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,339
along for my PE to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would like to</font>

1120
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:27,310
still continue to use the same either a

1121
00:43:24,339 --> 00:43:29,080
new session for v6 is fine or the best

1122
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:30,940
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i still want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the same v4</font>

1123
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:32,380
session which<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was using for v4</font>

1124
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,560
addresses i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to still continue</font>

1125
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:37,690
to use for v6 so things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1126
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the demand is and and that's what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1127
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:43,000
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the vendors are making</font>

1128
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:44,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that the v6 service is enabling v6</font>

1129
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,930
l3 VPN services is

1130
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,470
as much transparent as possible from

1131
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:51,640
from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an end-user perspective and</font>

1132
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:54,370
there are there are there are some

1133
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,660
challenges in terms of it but most of

1134
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:57,310
the provide most of the vendors do

1135
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:02,440
provide the six<font color="#E5E5E5"> vp functionality very</font>

1136
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:05,170
well today<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

1137
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:08,740
of gives<font color="#CCCCCC"> a a complete</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picture as what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1138
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:10,420
was talking about so if you if you look

1139
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:14,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">at it this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the service predator core</font>

1140
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:17,920
who would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to offer v6 VPN services</font>

1141
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:20,140
or who is already offering v4 services

1142
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,460
today now there are P routers and there

1143
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,140
are these are the PE routers that are

1144
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,970
existing and this could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the IP core</font>

1145
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:27,759
so similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what what we discussed</font>

1146
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:30,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">earlier now these are the customers so</font>

1147
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,160
this is one customer v6 only these are

1148
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:36,310
the v6 only customers which is this is a

1149
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,509
VPN yellow and there is a VPN blue so

1150
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:39,400
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we can call it as two</font>

1151
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:41,140
customers so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular customer</font>

1152
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,700
which is in VPN glue would like to have

1153
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:47,259
v4 and v6 VPNs on the same link and

1154
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,730
similarly there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a customer here which</font>

1155
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:53,230
is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ello customer who would like to</font>

1156
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:54,940
have only be six services now there is I

1157
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:57,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP sessions that are running across</font>

1158
00:44:54,940 --> 00:45:00,160
these PE routers which is the regular

1159
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:02,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-protocol</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp sessions that one and</font>

1160
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,910
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the things that that have been</font>

1161
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:06,700
have been modified with respect to v GP

1162
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:09,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think some of the slides further talk</font>

1163
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:11,350
about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the role of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp here which</font>

1164
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:13,750
is giving us a flexibility in making

1165
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:15,370
this transparent means there is no

1166
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:17,290
changes anywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am just making</font>

1167
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:23,319
changes in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp configuration or the</font>

1168
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:25,420
bgp bgp options so six<font color="#E5E5E5"> vpe so kind of</font>

1169
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,920
talks about here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's an</font>

1170
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:29,620
implementation of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there is</font>

1171
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">a VPN v6 address so VPN v6</font>

1172
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:34,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">address-family is what is the new thing</font>

1173
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:36,190
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is provided by bgp so the prefixes</font>

1174
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:38,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am learning from the customer so</font>

1175
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:40,990
for example from this v6 only customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1176
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,340
am learning a v6 prefixes now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> v fix</font>

1177
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:44,979
prefixes when it is supposed to be

1178
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:48,760
forwarded<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this particular PE router</font>

1179
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:51,190
it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> modified or prep ended with</font>

1180
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:54,610
some specific values which makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as</font>

1181
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:56,410
an VPN<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six prefixes now those values</font>

1182
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:58,200
are pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

1183
00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:00,480
in the case of v4 where

1184
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,250
are having<font color="#E5E5E5"> including a 64-bit route</font>

1185
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,440
distinguisher so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same route</font>

1186
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:08,490
distinguisher that we used in the case

1187
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:11,130
of v4 also and 128-bit ipv6 address so

1188
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:13,439
so we will see this little bit in detail

1189
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:16,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the next four slides next stop is</font>

1190
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,660
carried as a v4<font color="#CCCCCC"> map v6 address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1191
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:20,190
if you had attended in<font color="#E5E5E5"> sessions there so</font>

1192
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:24,598
we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

1193
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:27,510
v6 addresses so in this case the key

1194
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:30,390
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to key thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to notice p 1 and p</font>

1195
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">ii tues these PS are not changing their</font>

1196
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:34,078
loopback addresses so the loopback

1197
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:36,359
address is here are the common parameter

1198
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:39,810
that we use for clearing between p1 and

1199
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:42,119
p2 as we do in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case of v4 VPNs so i</font>

1200
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:43,619
would like to still use my v4 IP

1201
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:45,720
addresses that i have defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> on those</font>

1202
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:47,609
loopy addresses and would still continue

1203
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,919
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the multi protocol bgp session</font>

1204
00:46:47,609 --> 00:46:52,799
but i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to carry now v6</font>

1205
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,930
prefixes so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i carry the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> v fix /</font>

1206
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,109
success as it is the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> hop</font>

1207
00:46:54,930 --> 00:47:01,020
information that this PE gets will be

1208
00:46:58,109 --> 00:47:02,819
pointing to your v4 address so this PE

1209
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:06,210
would not be in a position to make a

1210
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:08,670
call saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a v6 prefix but the</font>

1211
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:09,960
next hop is pointing a v4 address so it

1212
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:11,310
will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to resolve this</font>

1213
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,230
particular prefix or install this

1214
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:16,140
particular prefix so there has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

1215
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:18,359
some mechanism where the v6 prefixes

1216
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,980
that have learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my customer when</font>

1217
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:21,750
I am forwarding them to this remote PE

1218
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,420
has some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a translation or a</font>

1219
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:27,180
conversion now that's what this VPN v6

1220
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,560
does for us so VPN v6 is making it is

1221
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,879
unique by putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the route</font>

1222
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,250
distinguisher pending the route

1223
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,680
distinguisher and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next hop</font>

1224
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:37,680
information for that prefix is basically

1225
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:40,020
it's a v4 perfect still it's a v4 map v6

1226
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,419
perfect so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a have a details on</font>

1227
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:44,190
how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would look so basically i'm</font>

1228
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:46,349
using the loopback address of this

1229
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:48,780
particular PE and prep ending<font color="#CCCCCC"> in with</font>

1230
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:51,119
this making it as a unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> v format v6</font>

1231
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:54,540
prefix the changes additional changes

1232
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:57,480
that we have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in VPN v6 as a part of</font>

1233
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:59,220
multi protocol bgp extension is we are

1234
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,589
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with we have a new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

1235
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:03,569
family identifier so which is which is

1236
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:06,750
with two so one is what we use for v4

1237
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:08,670
and sub address family is VPN 128 so

1238
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:10,589
this about<font color="#CCCCCC"> has family</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still remains the</font>

1239
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,820
same what I use for v4 VPNs I'm still

1240
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:13,759
you

1241
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:16,550
the same for v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> VPNs only change to</font>

1242
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,160
recognize a prefix as this is a VPN v6

1243
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:20,750
prefix and not a VPN v4 prefix is by

1244
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,490
making a changes in the address family

1245
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:26,270
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefixes that I am learning now</font>

1246
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:27,830
will be having an<font color="#E5E5E5"> EFI with two now along</font>

1247
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:29,600
with this so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a this is the</font>

1248
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:31,790
concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is encoding</font>

1249
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,020
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp next stuff so if you refer</font>

1250
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:35,540
through that RFC they<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked in detail</font>

1251
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">about encoding the bgp next stop so what</font>

1252
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:40,400
basically that means is I I need to take

1253
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,530
the v6 prefixes that I learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1254
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,230
remote Pease and now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to convert</font>

1255
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:46,850
them to make it as v4 map to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font>

1256
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:51,040
addresses so that is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

1257
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:53,330
encoding that needs to happen so I I did

1258
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:56,779
discuss a little bit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so the the</font>

1259
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:58,759
key main differences to make this this

1260
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:00,860
as transparent as possible to the end

1261
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:03,500
user is changes in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-protocol</font>

1262
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:05,480
ibge now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the key changes which</font>

1263
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,970
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> making us making the whole whole</font>

1264
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,950
experience of adding v6 into this

1265
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:12,200
network very transparent so from a

1266
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:14,390
service provider perspective all all the

1267
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:18,290
only change that he should be mainly

1268
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:20,120
aware of from the core from the provider

1269
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:23,000
edge router perspective is only making

1270
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:25,880
changes in his bgp configuration so now

1271
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,310
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp configuration which he had been</font>

00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:40,190

enables that between<font color="#E5E5E5"> all is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pease these</font>

1278
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:44,990
PS are now capable of exchanging v6

1279
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:46,760
prefixes that that is the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

1280
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:48,500
thing that could have happened now at

1281
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,690
the same time the edge drought edge

1282
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,980

1284
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:58,910
to handle v4 and v6 so what what this

1285
00:49:55,910 --> 00:50:01,790
gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> us here by making this particular</font>

1286
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:05,000
ibgp session to carry VPN v6 now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

1287
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:08,090
exchange the label ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> labeled ipv6</font>

1288
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,460
VPNs we pin prefixes oh siiii would have

1289
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:13,070
advertised a prefix to<font color="#E5E5E5"> PE 1 and PE 1</font>

1290
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:15,200
advertises that prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> to PE to now</font>

1291
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:17,600
those prefixes our VPN basics prefixes

1292
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,189
so obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need a label which is</font>

1293
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,410
what I can map it to that particular

1294
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:22,020
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can only be possible because</font>

1295
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,520
now

1296
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:27,630
multi protocol bgp has extended to

1297
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,190
handle it so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

vrf table are the routing tables

1347
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:41,990
obviously there will be a regular

00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,940
mechanism of forwarding these prefixes

1349
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:47,689
are advertising these prefixes why am I

<font color="#E5E5E5">mpi bgp now this is what this particular</font>

1351

router receives<font color="#CCCCCC"> us ipv6 advertiser's</font>

1353
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:55,100
from the CIA router now the PE router

1354
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:57,440
install these routes in the work table

1355
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:59,060
and assigns a VPN label attached to that

1356
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:03,190
particular prefix so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just wanted</font>

1363
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:18,860
family ipv6 so I was having a vrf which

had an<font color="#E5E5E5"> already value which has the RT</font>

so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route distribution on route</font>

1370
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:36,020

1371
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:38,450
an additional address-family ipv6 and

1372
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:40,040
I'm putting the artists for it that is

1373
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:41,899
the change that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing for the work I</font>

1374
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,610
don't need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change anything in the rd</font>

1375
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:46,160
for that poor if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can reuse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same rd</font>

1376
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:48,260
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am do using the same interface all</font>

1377
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,450
i am doing between<font color="#E5E5E5"> this PE and the c/e</font>

1378
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:53,420
that exists here i am defining IP

1379
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:54,919
addresses for v6 and i'm running<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1380
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,180
routing protocol between PE and see

1381
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,730
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two things that I am</font>

1382
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:01,460
seeing doing to get the prefixes install

1383
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:04,550
into this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> vrf table now from</font>

1384
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:06,080
a from a separation perspective the

1385
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:09,140
routing tables would be separated right

1386
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:11,720
so we would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a v6 vrf table and a v4</font>

1387
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:14,150
vrf table for the same customer link so

1388
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:16,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">you wouldn't be finding one single cable</font>

1389
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:19,010
for worth one and put both these

1390
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:20,900
prefixes together because from you need

1391
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:22,370
to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as as as independent as</font>

1392
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,920
possible because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want to put</font>

1393
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:27,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">both these prefixes into the one table</font>

1394
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,270
right so so the PE router install these

1395
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:31,040
routes into the wharf table and assigns

1396
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:34,009
a VPN label attached to the perfect so

1397
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:36,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is the regular MP bgp there is</font>

1398
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:39,320
nothing nothing uniqueness that that is

1399
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:42,350
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> done here so since i have multi</font>

1400
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:45,200
protocol bgp and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have VPN v6</font>

1401
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:46,759
address-family capabilities exchange so

1402
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,259
any prefixes that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn from my</font>

1403
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,350
customer router I

1404
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:54,320
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to allocate a label for it so that</font>

1405
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:57,230
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the VPN v6 because of the VPN v6 i'm</font>

1406
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:59,780
making this particular prefix with<font color="#E5E5E5"> label</font>

1407
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:01,900
so what that means is he allocates this

1408
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:05,210
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> PE router allocates a label</font>

1409
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:07,130
now this particular label is what I'm

1410
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:09,620
exchanging as a part of multi protocol

1411
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:11,420
bgp to the remote PE now this is this

1412
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:13,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular bullet here is what that is</font>

1413
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:15,410
referring to<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I already explained</font>

1414
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:17,180
the PE router has a VPN v6

1415
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:18,770
address-family enabled and peers with

1416
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,690
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> remote PE router so this this part</font>

1417
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:22,670
we already had done it before so the

1418
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:24,260
prefixes that I got here now it's I need

1419
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:26,480
to advertise so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of this</font>

1420
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:28,190
advertisement what what is the key

1421
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,220
factor that I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep in mind so</font>

1422
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:33,530
the VPN v6 that bgp encoding which I was

1423
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:36,080
referring earlier is what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so</font>

1424
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:39,380
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the v4 map you know v6 addresses</font>

1425
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:41,930
so so the v4 map v6 addresses is as

1426
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,940
defined as a standard so this is the

1427
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:46,520
format that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would see any of the</font>

1428
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:48,530
reformat v6 addresses looks like so the

1429
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:50,180
prefixes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am advertising from this</font>

1430
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:53,510
particular PE router to this particular

1431
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:55,460
PE router is going to go with this as

1432
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:59,600
the next stop so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means colon colon</font>

1433
00:55:55,460 --> 00:56:01,610
ffff colon this ipv4 is nothing but the

1434
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:05,450
loopback ID of this particular PE router

1435
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:08,120
so now this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular prefixes</font>

1436
00:56:05,450 --> 00:56:10,399
once it reaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> the remote PE now he</font>

1437
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:13,310
would install this particular PE based

1438
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,740
on the rd and the RT values that he had

1439
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:18,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">already defined for this particular vrf</font>

1440
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:20,569
so he would install this into the into

1441
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:24,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP table as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as into the vrf</font>

1442
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:26,330
tables now further once he has this

1443
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:28,370
particular routes the forwarding these

1444
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:30,650
routes to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> corresponding see router</font>

1445
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:33,170
is a game based on the routing protocol

1446
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:36,050
that I run between PE and see so if I am

1447
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:37,430
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> a BGP again from my ibgp</font>

1448
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:39,500
prefixes that I got I would have

1449
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:43,220
followed it to the to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers</font>

1450
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:45,230
routers or if I am running say eigrp<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1451
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:46,640
would have to redistribute those routes

1452
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:49,940
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have learnt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from there and</font>

1453
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:51,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">forwarded or I'm already running a</font>

1454
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,730
routing protocol between these two so

1455
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,250
the route should automatically reach the

1456
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:58,430
remote ze route now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this kind of</font>

1457
00:56:55,250 --> 00:57:01,100
a flow is what typically happens for v6

1458
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:02,118
prefixes now in the same network to do

1459
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:04,098
the v4<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1460
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:05,599
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much transparent so you even</font>

1461
00:57:04,099 --> 00:57:07,700
showed up v6 prefixes you would have got

1462
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:09,049
a v4 and it would have become a VPN

1463
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,749
before and it would have reached the

1464
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:15,619
remote end point so from the same axis<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1465
00:57:11,749 --> 00:57:18,578
am able to enable both the services<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1466
00:57:15,619 --> 00:57:22,249
so from a forwarding forwarding

1467
00:57:18,579 --> 00:57:23,869
perspective so this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how it it</font>

1468
00:57:22,249 --> 00:57:25,279
would look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like so before before from</font>

1469
00:57:23,869 --> 00:57:27,589
the forwarding let me let me give a

1470
00:57:25,279 --> 00:57:29,150
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit background on how these you</font>

1471
00:57:27,589 --> 00:57:31,849
know prefixes having learned so here is

1472
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:33,109
two sites so you know VPN be VPN these

1473
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:37,249
are the same customers but different

1474
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:40,400
sites so c1 is advertising prefix pe1

1475
00:57:37,249 --> 00:57:44,240
and now from from<font color="#CCCCCC"> pe1 we would be going</font>

1476
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:47,990
to p1 or p2 or PE to this is my core now

1477
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:51,258
the prefixes in this case the prefixes

1478
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:54,049
where advertised so<font color="#E5E5E5"> see VPN be is having</font>

1479
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:56,240
I think you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of the ipv4 it</font>

1480
00:57:54,049 --> 00:57:59,690
could be that you know ipv6 prefix here

1481
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:02,598
so ipv6 prefixes from ce1 he is

1482
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:05,029
advertised to a PE<font color="#E5E5E5"> one now this prefixes</font>

1483
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:08,809
would have gone to PE to as a part of

1484
00:58:05,029 --> 00:58:11,180
the regular VP and b6 exchange that I

1485
00:58:08,809 --> 00:58:13,400
explained earlier so this prefix now is

1486
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:14,808
advertised to back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> CD to as a part of</font>

1487
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:18,079
running protocols whatever i'm running

1488
00:58:14,809 --> 00:58:19,849
between these this so now ce2 knows how

1489
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:23,210
to get to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> e1 as a part of this route</font>

1490
00:58:19,849 --> 00:58:25,099
exchange now from ce2 I will be sending

1491
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:29,029
a packet for this particular destination

1492
00:58:25,099 --> 00:58:30,650
which is 2001 colon colon<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 right so now</font>

1493
00:58:29,029 --> 00:58:32,869
this particular packet when it reaches

1494
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:35,539
PE to a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font>

1495
00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:38,420
happen here is it will be it will be

1496
00:58:35,539 --> 00:58:40,430
imposing a label 29 as an example so

1497
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:43,519
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the label that I had exchanged</font>

1498
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:45,618
as a part of my VPN v6 address-family

1499
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:48,140
exchange so from PE 1 to P you too I

1500
00:58:45,619 --> 00:58:50,839
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done this route exchange so I</font>

1501
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:53,269
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be I will be imposing that</font>

1502
00:58:50,839 --> 00:58:54,950
particular label 29 on this which is

1503
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:56,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">that what i call the encapsulation here</font>

1504
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:59,029
now from here the packet that is

1505
00:58:56,930 --> 00:59:02,149
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out now two things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1506
00:58:59,029 --> 00:59:05,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs to happen so one is one one one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1507
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:07,460
them is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to impose or I need to</font>

1508
00:59:05,299 --> 00:59:09,980
encapsulate this particular packet with

1509
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:12,319
an ipv4 header and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> l2tp v3 here so</font>

1510
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:14,450
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the part that was already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

1511
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:14,910
before means PE one knows how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to</font>

1512
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:16,890
p2

1513
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:19,078
when what encapsulation it is supposed

1514
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:21,150
to impose so that part have already been

1515
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:23,220
done for v4 now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to use the</font>

1516
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:25,170
same concept here and but only the

1517
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:28,049
payload is different so the payload is a

1518
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:30,869
v6 payload so I have a v6 payload here

1519
00:59:28,049 --> 00:59:32,700
VPN label for that particular but the

1520
00:59:30,869 --> 00:59:34,559
source IP and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> destination IP which</font>

1521
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:36,990
is part of this IP header is just

1522
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:39,329
belonging to p1 so the source IP address

1523
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:41,848
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ve one PE to destination IP address</font>

1524
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:45,599
is PE<font color="#E5E5E5"> one now once this packet comes to</font>

1525
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:47,760
p2 only look up is done on this ipv4

1526
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:50,220
header now the remaining all of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1527
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,740
transparent so the packet that comes to

1528
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:54,808
p2 it would do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lookup and then it</font>

1529
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:57,419
forwards that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular packet to PE</font>

1530
00:59:54,809 --> 01:00:00,299
one because it's a regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP or and</font>

1531
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:02,520
regular IP lookup now from p1<font color="#E5E5E5"> the packet</font>

1532
01:00:00,299 --> 01:00:05,009
would be forwarded to PE one and which

1533
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,660
is where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would see a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1534
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:08,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">things needs to happen here is where he</font>

1535
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:11,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">would do a lookup on IP header and that</font>

1536
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,960
look up will will will give an

1537
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:16,140
indication that that packet belongs to

1538
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,329
PE<font color="#E5E5E5"> one it then does a look up into the</font>

1539
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:21,058
l2tp<font color="#E5E5E5"> v3 header does the session ID and</font>

1540
01:00:18,329 --> 01:00:23,309
cookie match and then a label look up so

1541
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:25,319
once the labor<font color="#E5E5E5"> lookup is done then it</font>

1542
01:00:23,309 --> 01:00:27,450
will figure out that this particular

1543
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:31,859
packet is now supposed to be going out

1544
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:34,770
onto VPN<font color="#E5E5E5"> B or C 1 now the lookup is done</font>

1545
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:37,710
for this particular prefix 2001 11 so

1546
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:41,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">this particular ipv6 prefix is done into</font>

1547
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:43,349
the v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> brf table so this importing of</font>

1548
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:45,299
this prefix and the prefix available in

1549
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:47,339
PE<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was already done as</font>

1550
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:49,589
a part of the regular control plane set

1551
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:52,200
up now the packet from ve one would be

1552
01:00:49,589 --> 01:00:55,770
forwarded to see one regular ipv6

1553
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:57,240
forwarding so a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> things here this</font>

1554
01:00:55,770 --> 01:01:00,000
source address destination address and

1555
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is pretty much for VPN v6 we</font>

1556
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,319
have pretty much for the ipv6 prefix for

this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers payload VPN</font>

1559
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:12,089
and cookie information is what what was

1560
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:14,670
exchanged as a part of my tunnel or<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1563
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:23,339
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> exchanged as a part of going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1564
01:01:20,339 --> 01:01:25,230
p1 to p2 so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is how it</font>

1565
01:01:23,339 --> 01:01:27,000
would look when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a packet</font>

1566
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:30,779
at this place because encapsulation is

1567
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:37,680
happening at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point of time right so</font>

1568
01:01:30,779 --> 01:01:41,400
any any<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1569
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:44,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">just the one of the slides I just wanted</font>

1570
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:48,990
to bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and which talks about global</font>

1571
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:50,970
v6 services so here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I'm calling</font>

1572
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:54,180
it as a 6pe if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the key</font>

1573
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:56,339
differences here is this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1574
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:58,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">regular MPI bgp sessions that is running</font>

1575
01:01:56,339 --> 01:02:00,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">it still the same IP core only</font>

1576
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:03,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">difference here is this this particular</font>

1577
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:07,109
PE router is having<font color="#E5E5E5"> be4 as well as v6</font>

1578
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:10,288
and this is not a part of any VPN so

1579
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:12,480
it's a you know globally defined ipv6

1580
01:02:10,289 --> 01:02:14,430
addresses which is a part which is and

1581
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,490
each one of these v6 links always

1582
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:19,379
excites have unique v6 addresses because

1583
01:02:17,490 --> 01:02:21,149
you cannot have overlapping v6 addresses

1584
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:24,990
now the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> being they are not as a</font>

1585
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:26,640
part of any<font color="#CCCCCC"> brf</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tables so so ipv6 global</font>

1586
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:28,288
connective over ipv4 course so it's

1587
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:29,879
still the still the same there is no

1588
01:02:28,289 --> 01:02:33,180
much difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could still use the</font>

1589
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:34,980
same tunnel end caps and l2tp<font color="#E5E5E5"> v3 formats</font>

1590
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:39,029
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm using as transparent as</font>

1591
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:41,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then ipv6 reach ability as</font>

1592
01:02:39,029 --> 01:02:44,430
exchange by a psy ibgp that still holds

1593
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:47,129
good ipv6 transported from 6p<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 6p so</font>

1594
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:49,140
from here to here the v6 prefixes would

1595
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:51,660
be now regularly and so there is even

1596
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:55,020
now here also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> p routers are not</font>

1597
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:57,240
aware of any v6 because I bgp session is

1598
01:02:55,020 --> 01:03:04,559
the one that had carried these ipv6

1599
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:09,180
across from p1 to p2<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so just to</font>

1600
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:12,000
give you a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit some as I said</font>

1601
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:15,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is just a sample sample flow</font>

1602
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,150
because pretty much I assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic</font>

1603
01:03:15,089 --> 01:03:20,130
l3 VPN concepts are known and here all

1604
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:22,770
I'm focusing more with respect to how

1605
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:24,720
all of this are integrated whether it's

1606
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:26,849
a IP core and mpls core and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

1607
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:30,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">enable v4 and v6 services as</font>

1608
01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:32,609
transparently as possible so looking at

1609
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:35,009
this particular topology you could see

1610
01:03:32,609 --> 01:03:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a PE</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 and PE 2 are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

1611
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:39,970
provider routers and they have these

1612
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:41,770
are the customer edge router so um just

1613
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:43,868
calling it as a router tester<font color="#E5E5E5"> sazon as</font>

1614
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:48,310
as a as an example but<font color="#E5E5E5"> these can be</font>

1615
01:03:43,869 --> 01:03:50,230
assumed to be my edge routers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font>

1616
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:54,100
running these are the access points that

1617
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:55,869
I have so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some past links or it</font>

1618
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:58,060
can be a giggi link or it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of</font>

1619
01:03:55,869 --> 01:04:01,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">the interface types available from v1 to</font>

1620
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:04,720
this router tester and from p1 to p2 i'm

1621
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:07,240
having an uplink using uh it's a pass

1622
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">uplink that runs from p1 and p2 and if</font>

1623
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,899
you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> loopback addresses these</font>

1624
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:15,490
are the v4 loopback address here 5 55 60

1625
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:17,920

1627
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:23,140
go with ospf as well to achieve<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1633
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:42,760
information exchange and VPN v6 so what

1634
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:45,970
what this is the this is the key key

1635
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:48,400
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because if a provider</font>

1636
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:50,618
doesn't have a VPN v6 at his family then

1637
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,300
he will not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the v6</font>

1638
01:04:50,619 --> 01:04:54,640

01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:57,310
vpe or our basic services for its

1640
01:04:54,640 --> 01:05:00,160
customers so so pretty much p 1 and p

1641
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:01,930
you to have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have at least these to</font>

1642
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:07,000
make sure that they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

1643
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:10,118
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward v4 or v6 or an IP core along</font>

1644
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">with this from PE to to my router</font>

1645
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:14,440
testers are my edge routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would be</font>

1646
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:18,100
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> having the regular routing</font>

1647
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:19,750
protocols so it could be ebgp or ospf

1648
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:22,630
for any our static routing so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font>

1649
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:24,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">just giving an example of ebgp that runs</font>

1650
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:27,730
between my<font color="#CCCCCC"> C routers and PE routers and</font>

1651
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:29,140
the same between here so the prefixes

1652
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:31,630
that are advertised here i am giving one

1653
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:33,190
example as 120 110 so it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be any</font>

1654
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:37,180
other prefixes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am advertising</font>

1655
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:39,430
which which goes from p1 and p2 now so

1656
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:41,850
the few configurations that one has to

1657
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:44,049
make to make this work<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is</font>

1658
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:46,900
configuring the multi protocol bgp with

1659
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:48,040
this configuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> isas for this and a</font>

1660
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,910
tunnel<font color="#E5E5E5"> template or a tunnel</font>

1661
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:52,940
configurations that<font color="#CCCCCC"> H to be done on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1662
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:55,308
router so once this is done then we are

1663
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:57,799
we are eligible to accept prefixes that

1664
01:05:55,309 --> 01:05:59,480
come from the sea routers and then we

1665
01:05:57,799 --> 01:06:01,490
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to forward those prefixes</font>

1666
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:03,650
to the remote CA routers and when the

1667
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:05,689
traffic needs to be coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this</font>

1668
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:07,609
particular see router all the way if it

1669
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:10,190
has to reach to the sea router then the

1670
01:06:07,609 --> 01:06:11,538
encapsulation with l2tp v3 and things

1671
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:15,799
like that will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty pretty</font>

1672
01:06:11,539 --> 01:06:19,490
straightforward so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is again as I</font>

1673
01:06:15,799 --> 01:06:24,500
said this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a config guide you know</font>

1683
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:53,049
and three dots<font color="#E5E5E5"> X is those releases are</font>

1684
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:56,770
the ones that are capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of providing</font>

1685
01:06:53,049 --> 01:06:59,240
this VPN v4 or VPN v6 capabilities so

1686
01:06:56,770 --> 01:07:02,569
pretty much this this configuration what

1687
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:04,939
it is referring is is derived from VPN

1688
01:07:02,569 --> 01:07:09,859
before and VPN<font color="#E5E5E5"> B's derive from iOS XR</font>

1689
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:11,960
config guide so p1 config so looking

1690
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:14,900
back to this so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PE one</font>

1691
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:16,400
router is what would be what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

1692
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:19,460
something like this time I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1693
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:21,829
picking<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the aod</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no waiting 08 one</font>

1694
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:25,339
of the service father's routers here so

1695
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:26,869
a BGP route variety<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we spoke a</font>

1696
01:07:25,339 --> 01:07:29,299
lot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning as well so the BGP</font>

1697
01:07:26,869 --> 01:07:31,039
router ID is a key it's very essential

1698
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:32,390
in the case of X are you it's not

1699
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:34,190
explicitly there then it will not be

1700
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:37,400
able to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that out</font>

1701
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:40,130
ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick so it's ipv4 loopback</font>

1702
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:42,619
address that i have defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is what i</font>

1703
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:44,359
am going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the router ID for</font>

1704
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:47,720
irrespective whichever address families

1705
01:07:44,359 --> 01:07:51,920
that i am<font color="#CCCCCC"> using here so we discussed</font>

1706
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:54,470
about v4 map v6 addresses so it will

1707
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:56,690
generate that address based on this

1708
01:07:54,470 --> 01:08:01,098
loopback ID so it will be colon colon

1709
01:07:56,690 --> 01:08:02,390
ffff colon 5 45 or 50 55 so this router

1710
01:08:01,099 --> 01:08:03,559
ID kind of determine

1711
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:07,279
for all the parameters that we have

1712
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:09,410
defined here now neighbor 333 so this is

1713
01:08:07,279 --> 01:08:11,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">the neighbor that i am talking with and</font>

1714
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:14,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm giving an update source loopback0</font>

1715
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:19,310
this is this is the regular regular ibgp

1716
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:22,219
concepts address-family ipv4 tunnel VPN

1720
01:08:27,139 --> 01:08:30,770
done between these two will be capable

1721
01:08:29,029 --> 01:08:33,199
of doing few things so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1722
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:36,529
with this ipv4 tunnel this address

1724
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:41,719
v3 information between p1 and p2 so once

1725
01:08:39,948 --> 01:08:45,229
i have defined the term template i will

01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:57,198
vice versa VPN be for unicast this one

1731
01:08:54,859 --> 01:09:00,080
makes every customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> prophets unique</font>

1732
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:02,689
across the network and I'm exchanging

01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:05,028
this between<font color="#E5E5E5"> p 1 and p youtube and i'm</font>

1735
01:09:05,029 --> 01:09:10,790
values and things like that VPN v6 so I

1736
01:09:07,908 --> 01:09:13,638
ipv6 unicast this becomes essential if

1737
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:16,639
I'm doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> six PE services so I am</font>

01:09:22,219 --> 01:09:28,189
essential because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making the</font>

1747
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:44,540
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would like to have multicast along</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same customer</font>

1752
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:55,638
link what is the additional thing I need

1753
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:57,949
to do so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to modify the</font>

01:09:55,639 --> 01:10:00,050

1756
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:06,320

01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:07,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm having i am able to transport all of</font>

these services on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

1759
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:11,480
infrastructure pretty much same

1760
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,280
infrastructure for any of the services

1761
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:16,230
in future also which gets enabled

1762
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:18,480
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am relying on bgp extensions</font>

1763
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:20,280
and as you know a lot of weeks believe

1764
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:22,829
in BGP for carrying all of this so

1765
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:24,960
pretty much relying on bgp for my

1766
01:10:22,829 --> 01:10:26,849
capability for for the exchange of these

1767
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,199
services it helps from the service

1768
01:10:26,849 --> 01:10:30,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">product that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not investing anything</font>

1769
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:32,669
in my core network i'm just using the

1770
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:34,980
same infrastructure that i have so

1771
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:38,340
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much this this kind of gives a</font>

1772
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:42,360
view of how the bgp would look like from

1773
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:44,639
a PE 2 c-e so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is again from x-art I</font>

1774
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:47,489
didn't say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will fix this so this</font>

1775
01:10:44,639 --> 01:10:49,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">is again from an XR iOS XR so if you</font>

1776
01:10:47,489 --> 01:10:51,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at this is PE 1 and this is the</font>

1777
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:53,820
interface that is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the route</font>

1778
01:10:51,809 --> 01:10:56,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">tester or the customer or the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cee router</font>

1779
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:57,840
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my services are enabled</font>

1780
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,909
so this is what i would have provision

1781
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:02,699
to my customer my enterprise customer

1782
01:10:59,909 --> 01:11:04,769
this customer belongs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> vrf vp and 55</font>

1783
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:07,049
this is the name of the VPN<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it can</font>

1784
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:09,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything this is ipv4 address i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1785
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:11,190
given for that customer and this is the

1786
01:11:09,059 --> 01:11:12,869
ipv6 address which has been associated

1787
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:16,019
to that particular customer or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the link</font>

1788
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:17,940
i am giving i'm telling that ipv6 is

1789
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:20,760
enabled<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this so this is a this is an</font>

1790
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:22,980
optional command by just defining ipv6

1791
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,500
address i think ipv6 do get enabled on

1792
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:27,089
the other interface encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1793
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">hdl-c and keep our empty cycle so i</font>

1794
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:30,869
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is generally so along with</font>

1795
01:11:28,829 --> 01:11:33,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">this the other thing which is associated</font>

1796
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:38,759
to this cutter customer worth VPN 55 is

1797
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:41,880
this part is used with respect to VPN

1798
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:45,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">v4r v4 services ipv4 services so</font>

1805
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:03,300
stack works basically mean that is a

1806
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:05,670
worth which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for v4 now the</font>

a v6 so from from a service product

1809

perspective the only additional service

1810

what this I think it's snapshot from a

1821
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:42,220
config what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this tells here is I am</font>

1822
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:45,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> V RSVP and V Phi and I'm</font>

1823
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:47,650
running ebgp between my PE and see now

1824
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:49,330
the way I look at it so I have the

1825
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:51,700
already defined under<font color="#CCCCCC"> wharf and this</font>

1826
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:54,370
neighbor 15 112 is where I'm talking

1827
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:57,220
with my customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is 15</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 11 is my</font>

1828
01:12:54,370 --> 01:13:00,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">local router 15 1 12 is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my c e router</font>

1829
01:12:57,220 --> 01:13:02,680
and his asz<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7000</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address-family ipv4 so</font>

1830
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:05,860
these are the route policies to accept

1831
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:07,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">or deny routes and neighbor 51 51 1</font>

1832
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:10,750
colon to this is the neighbor address

1833
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:12,310
remote areas is 7001 it could be the

1834
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:14,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">same it could be different you could</font>

1835
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:16,780
have you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> two links or it could be</font>

1836
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:21,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same and address family ipv6 unicast</font>

1837
01:13:16,780 --> 01:13:24,099
so pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much now by doing this the p 2</font>

1838
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:26,589
c-e links will be a capable of

1839
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:29,890
exchanging v4 prefixes or v6 prefixes

1840
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:32,830
and now we will be able to import them

1841
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:35,260
as an address family VPN v6 because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1842
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:37,690
already have the VPN v6 capability

1843
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:39,070
exchange done previously so any prefixes

1844
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:41,950
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> learnt from this particular</font>

1845
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:43,599
customer will now become a VPN basics

1846
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:46,830
and gets forwarded to the remote PE

1847
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:49,090
router so the changes that are involved

1848
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:51,040
ivory at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at it from a high</font>

1849
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:54,190
level is provisioning involves only

1850
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:55,420
these few steps as well as whatever is

1851
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:59,950
the routing protocol that I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> chosen</font>

1852
01:13:55,420 --> 01:14:03,670
here i have chosen ibgp for v6 if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had</font>

1853
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:05,650
used eh grp or if i had used ospfv3 then

1854
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:11,020
my configuration would be under ospfv3

1855
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:14,070
for that particular vrf ok so this you

1856
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:17,860
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it this kind of summarizes</font>

1857
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:22,990
all the possible scenarios that one can

1858
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:25,210
achieve v4 v6 or l2vpn services now on

1859
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:27,010
top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I could have I could have</font>

1860
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:29,080
included many other things but it's it's

1861
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:31,270
a huge list because we could we could

1862
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:33,040
have l2vpn on the same existing

1863
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:36,040
infrastructure so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP</font>

1864
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:39,280
infrastructure with providing v4 and v6

1865
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:40,710
l3 VPN services today now new services

1866
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:42,719
can be offered<font color="#E5E5E5"> transparently</font>

1867
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:45,300
now that could be later too so I am

1868
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:47,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">already running l2tp v3 I can use the</font>

1869
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:50,160
same l2tp protocol that exists and

1870
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:52,680
achieve layer 2 VPNs so which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is already</font>

1871
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:54,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">being serviced and provided today now on</font>

1872
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:56,460
top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I could go with native</font>

1873
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:58,710
multicast or I can go with multicast VPN

1874
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:01,260
now if i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer multicast VPN</font>

1875
01:14:58,710 --> 01:15:03,719
services bgp MDT safi so this is the sub

1876
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:05,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">Madras family under bgp again so there</font>

1877
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:07,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a multi multi protocol bgp has</font>

1878
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:10,020
extended to support multicast VPN also

1879
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:12,660
so how would they do it is basically we

1880
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:15,690
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an MDT safi that is defined so in</font>

1881
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:18,710
my router configuration here it would

1882
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:22,559
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> become address-family MDT unicast</font>

1883
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:25,620
address family mdg multicast right so

1884
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:27,930
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be enabled enabled</font>

1885
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:29,940
as well so quality of service is another

1886
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:31,230
parameter so from an edge<font color="#CCCCCC"> gencorp i</font>

1887
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:33,660
think it's it's very much transferring

1888
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:36,809
so I I didn't mention one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the one of</font>

1889
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:39,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thoughts there is the tunnel IP the</font>

1890
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:41,460
IP which is which is carried as a part

1891
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:43,830
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> l2tp 3i header it's a 20 by type II</font>

1892
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:46,560
and you saw a toss right there so that

1893
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:48,540
class<font color="#CCCCCC"> bite again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be used for any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> qos</font>

1894
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:51,420
related stuff that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do in the</font>

1895
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:54,450
court so similarly how we have when we

1896
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:56,910
have an igp label in mpls where we have

1897
01:15:54,450 --> 01:16:00,809
the EXP values which are used in the

1898
01:15:56,910 --> 01:16:03,599
core to do to all the quality of

1899
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:06,360
services the same functionality can be

1900
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:09,060
obtained by using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tas values that</font>

1901
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:10,920
exists in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> l2tp v3 header so that's</font>

1902
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:13,890
what i meant here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's transparent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1903
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:17,520
can do edge as well as core quality of

1904
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:19,200
service and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these features can be</font>

1905
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,969
integrated on the service<font color="#CCCCCC"> verda</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

1906
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:23,700
and which is very much transparent to

1907
01:16:20,969 --> 01:16:26,239
the customers right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so see i see an</font>

1908
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:29,849
interest i am<font color="#E5E5E5"> just keeping a bullet here</font>

1909
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:32,759
so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a two minutes talk on</font>

1910
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:34,530
this so see you see an interest<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope</font>

1911
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:36,330
some of you are aware of this so

1912
01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:39,870
basically this provides a functionality

1913
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:43,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">of interoperate with the other providers</font>

1914
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:45,420
so I could have my customer who is home

1915
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:47,670
to giving examples here so a customer

1916
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:50,489
who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> owned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by AT&T who is offering l3</font>

1917
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:51,659
VPN services but i have my site another

1918
01:16:50,489 --> 01:16:53,129
site is

1919
01:16:51,659 --> 01:16:55,669
home to another provider it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font>

1920
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:59,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">sprint so now how can i achieve</font>

1921
01:16:55,669 --> 01:17:00,689
connectivity between AT&T of the site

1922
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:03,179
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is connected to AT&T and a site</font>

1923
01:17:00,689 --> 01:17:04,969
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is connected to sprint so there</font>

1924
01:17:03,179 --> 01:17:06,989
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be some mechanism of interpret</font>

1925
01:17:04,969 --> 01:17:08,729
interoperability or service /<font color="#CCCCCC"> router</font>

1926
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:11,518
exchange between provided one and

1927
01:17:08,729 --> 01:17:13,110
provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where the sir we</font>

1928
01:17:11,519 --> 01:17:16,349
carrier services carrier comes into play

1929
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:18,659
or inter<font color="#E5E5E5"> AS comes into play so interest</font>

1930
01:17:16,349 --> 01:17:21,570
is pretty much is used in the scenario

1931
01:17:18,659 --> 01:17:24,239
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I explained where I have multiple</font>

1932
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:25,860
options I could have entry as option

1933
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:27,570
Tenet's it's one of the options of

1934
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:29,909
connecting these works<font color="#CCCCCC"> back-to-back or</font>

1935
01:17:27,570 --> 01:17:32,308
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many other options like can be</font>

1936
01:17:29,909 --> 01:17:35,249
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10c which kind of provides different</font>

1937
01:17:32,309 --> 01:17:36,989
mechanism of forwarding prefixes of

1938
01:17:35,249 --> 01:17:39,478
customers are providing connectivity of

1939
01:17:36,989 --> 01:17:41,718
customers who is home to cite one on one

1940
01:17:39,479 --> 01:17:45,630
provider when I site another provider

1941
01:17:41,719 --> 01:17:48,630
CSC is basically a service provider one

1942
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:50,699
is using another service provider as a

1943
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:52,619
transit and reaching the third service

1944
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:55,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">border so i could have provider one</font>

1945
01:17:52,619 --> 01:17:57,509
provider to and then i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main</font>

1946
01:17:55,079 --> 01:18:00,150
provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> out or the transit provider so</font>

1947
01:17:57,510 --> 01:18:03,570
carrier servicing carriers so supporting

1948
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:05,429
carrier so so these two concepts are

1949
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:08,849
features of functionality which is so

1950
01:18:05,429 --> 01:18:10,949
critical is is pretty much transparent

1951
01:18:08,849 --> 01:18:12,449
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's IP core mpls course so</font>

1952
01:18:10,949 --> 01:18:14,909
today we have that flexibility already

1953
01:18:12,449 --> 01:18:17,129
in place which can provide see<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sen</font>

1954
01:18:14,909 --> 01:18:20,699
andreas functionality which is in parity

1955
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:22,769
with mpls space Corps transit carriers

1956
01:18:20,699 --> 01:18:24,178
can be IP core base<font color="#E5E5E5"> by baby carriers</font>

1957
01:18:22,769 --> 01:18:26,909
could be in PL ascorbate so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I meant</font>

1958
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:29,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the case of CSC is you have you have</font>

1959
01:18:26,909 --> 01:18:31,679
provider one provider to provider one

1960
01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:33,989
can be MPLS based provider to can be

1961
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,249
ip-based so it's still both of them can

1962
01:18:33,989 --> 01:18:40,468
work transparently that's what this

1963
01:18:35,249 --> 01:18:42,389
talks about so in summary so as if there

1964
01:18:40,469 --> 01:18:44,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an infrastructure which is which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1965
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:47,039
full of IP core and there is no there is

1966
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:49,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">no investment or there is no plans to go</font>

1967
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:52,050
with the MPLS based core we have

1968
01:18:49,619 --> 01:18:53,909
mechanisms in place today where all the

1969
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:55,919
business enterprise services can be

1970
01:18:53,909 --> 01:18:59,879
transparently enabled even why have an

1971
01:18:55,919 --> 01:19:01,139
IP core enabling l3v<font color="#E5E5E5"> P&V for v6 or the</font>

1972
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:02,219
legacy infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's</font>

1973
01:19:01,139 --> 01:19:04,469
what brings in

1974
01:19:02,219 --> 01:19:05,789
as an advantage here because there is no

1975
01:19:04,469 --> 01:19:07,920
investment in the core to make any

1976
01:19:05,789 --> 01:19:09,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">changes or I have an IP core which i</font>

1977
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:11,369
have been using all along<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to add</font>

1978
01:19:09,989 --> 01:19:13,018
these additional services because my

1979
01:19:11,369 --> 01:19:14,969
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are demanding it's it's still</font>

1980
01:19:13,019 --> 01:19:17,280
a feasible thing new services can be

1981
01:19:14,969 --> 01:19:18,630
safely integrated easily the integration

1982
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:22,079
is pretty straightforward because we are

1983
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:23,369
laying on bgp for most of it I don't

1984
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:24,630
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part but I did put it</font>

1985
01:19:23,369 --> 01:19:27,719
network troubleshooting and maintenance

1986
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:29,340
is simplified I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I don't</font>

1987
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:30,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so any day we are in a position to</font>

1988
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:33,960
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything he simplified these days</font>

1989
01:19:30,929 --> 01:19:36,530
so only one thing which I learned to all

1990
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:40,199
the period of time is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> with an MPLS</font>

1991
01:19:36,530 --> 01:19:43,110
background there is a cell-based mpls if

1992
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:44,039
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about which is based on ATM ATM</font>

1993
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:45,719
network if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have an idiom</font>

1994
01:19:44,039 --> 01:19:47,880
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to run mpls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1995
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:49,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so we call it a cell-based mpls so</font>

1996
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:52,289
the complexities that involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1997
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:53,909
cell based mpls and mpls in general from

1998
01:19:52,289 --> 01:19:56,309
an expertise perspective<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that is</font>

1999
01:19:53,909 --> 01:19:57,719
what this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to solve because I p</font>

2000
01:19:56,309 --> 01:19:59,460
is something that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all comfortable</font>

2001
01:19:57,719 --> 01:20:01,679
with and pretty much the features have

2002
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:03,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">parity with mpls so you wouldn't see any</font>

2003
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:07,940
difference in terms of whether i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

2004
01:20:03,539 --> 01:20:10,018
MPLS Korra an IP core as a vendor

2005
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:13,409
implementation of the gears are very

2006
01:20:10,019 --> 01:20:16,170
smart ID so from a local perspective

2007
01:20:13,409 --> 01:20:18,839
from configuring my hardware or

2008
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:19,979
designing my hardware they have been

2009
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:22,229
made things which are very much

2010
01:20:19,979 --> 01:20:25,320
simplified because routers are good

2011
01:20:22,229 --> 01:20:28,849
doing and outlook up I palooka so so

2012
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:32,249
that's that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> i hope i hope this</font>

2013
01:20:28,849 --> 01:20:34,619
session gave you some overview about how

2014
01:20:32,249 --> 01:20:36,389
we can use IP core if you have any

2015
01:20:34,619 --> 01:20:41,579
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> please let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me know and i'm</font>

2016
01:20:36,389 --> 01:20:44,070

2017
01:20:41,579 --> 01:20:46,739
questions so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my email</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ID on it</font>

2018
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:49,590
and i'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be around please feel free to</font>

2019
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:50,789
discuss I've been one of the key

2020
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:52,289
providers who are doing this already

2021
01:20:50,789 --> 01:20:54,018
sprint is one of the key providers who

2022
01:20:52,289 --> 01:20:56,670
are offering this kind of services today

2023
01:20:54,019 --> 01:20:59,280
it's it's been pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much going well so</font>

2024
01:20:56,670 --> 01:21:01,580
i can share<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of details with their</font>

2025
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:04,670
deployments and now which

2026
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:04,670
thank you
