1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:05,790
yeah hi I'm a Stiga knows I'm going to

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:09,900
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> some multicast tools have</font>

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:13,799
been working on their call as a sampling

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,900
and ASM thing as might guess as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:19,350
thing as a tool to test as a sem

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,900
connectivity so it's something similar

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,170
to normal ping to check that you can

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,310
receive multicast this is done<font color="#E5E5E5"> using UDP</font>

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,590
so there's no not special support needed

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,829
in any operating systems or in the

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,649
network it's just well 11 server

12
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:43,739
listening to a UDP port Janice client

13
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:45,899
sending packets to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> portent so so the</font>

14
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,328
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> this works is quite simple you have</font>

15
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:52,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">some client call as a same thing where</font>

16
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,850
you specify a source address system like

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,899
the address of some server you want to

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:01,500
ping the client joins<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eskimo G the G is</font>

19
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard-coded and then the client sends a</font>

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,540
unicast request and it gets to hopefully

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,810
two packets back on unicast response in

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,780
the multicast response and it does this

23
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:17,549
every second and that the result of this

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:20,850
is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this so this case we</font>

25
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,820
can see that we send five we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have sent</font>

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:29,009
five queries and they got some unicast

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:32,039
and multicast responses and yeah should

28
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,409
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a pointer i guess but you can</font>

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,380
see here that we didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a response</font>

30
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,790
to the first unit costs request that's

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,640
because the mob boss tree wasn't

32
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">established but we got one to the second</font>

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,070
after one second so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that tells us that</font>

34
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,860
multicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> three was in place within one</font>

35
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,990
second you can also see that the number

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,810
of hops for unicast and multicast are

37
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,240
above 13 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully that means they</font>

38
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,439
have congruent routing the unicast and

39
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:04,829
multicast can't be short course but also

40
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:07,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">the the delay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Rogers a round-trip time</font>

41
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,079
the time from a central request until

42
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,690
they got the unicast reply and the

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,790
multi-cut reply are about the same

44
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,820
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is slightly more variation in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

45
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:21,530
multicast times we can see if you look

46
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,530
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard deviation at the bottom</font>

47
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">so by doing this we can somehow compare</font>

48
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,160
the characteristics of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> unicast</font>

49
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:33,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">multicast and that can be useful I think</font>

50
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,370
and we can see well some more

51
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">information about the multi-culti we</font>

52
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't just see that we can receive</font>

53
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,240
multicast we get some<font color="#CCCCCC"> additional info</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

54
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,280
think this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful just above for end</font>

55
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,140
users that just want to know can i

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,180
receive multicast but also for people

57
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,950
that want to figure out whether things

58
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:57,630
work as expected this is small as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

59
00:02:52,950 --> 00:03:02,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">said and then there is also to local ASM</font>

60
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:05,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">ping which is very similar for ASM</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bing</font>

61
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:12,180
you specified a group and the server

62
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:14,340
tipping so yeah I should say that the

63
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,340
server for ASM is the same as a server

64
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,380
for SSM there's no difference really you

65
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:24,570
just send responses to different group

66
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:26,340
letters and this is much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun on me</font>

67
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,829
as a sem case because you have things

68
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">like msdp and yes which from shortest at</font>

69
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,630
shared reader shortest path tree and so

70
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:38,010
on so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see some fun things</font>

71
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:40,470
like you get like 200 milliseconds delay

72
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,109
for the first multicultural spawns we

73
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,220
get and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's only seven hubs</font>

74
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:49,320
instead of 23 which is the unicast stuff

75
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:51,930
that's probably because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data packet</font>

76
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:56,700
being sent for ms.vp and some caching at

77
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:58,890
the logo run the viewpoint because we

78
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,709
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see some yeah interesting things</font>

79
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:04,440
like that also we see that eventually

80
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:07,410
when they hopefully are on the shortest

81
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:10,290
path tree we have 21 hubs while it's 23

82
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:14,010
for unit<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost so that puffs are not</font>

83
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,168
congruent and it's not so easy to see

84
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,000
here in this example but sometimes you

85
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:19,589
can also tell when the switch is from

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,200
the shelter e to the shortest path tree

87
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:24,599
or if that happens at all just by

88
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,719
looking at the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 00 hopes the</font>

89
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,120
package has

90
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:33,400
packets have<font color="#E5E5E5"> traveled so yeah I've been</font>

91
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,190
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these tools and I'm musing on</font>

92
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,419
myself to debug things in my network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

93
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:42,670
also no smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> people using this stuff</font>

94
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:46,140
you can get these tools if you want to

95
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:50,380
play with<font color="#CCCCCC"> them at a URL at the top there</font>

96
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:53,050
it's available<font color="#E5E5E5"> for most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well most unix</font>

97
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:58,020
based platforms and windows vista and XP

98
00:04:53,050 --> 00:05:01,230
as well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> supports both</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4 and ipv6</font>

99
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:04,270
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> having written that these tools</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

100
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,640
also wrote a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little too so called MZ</font>

101
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,430
first which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at least to me is</font>

102
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,130
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of useful of Maya people asking me</font>

103
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,350
can receive our multicast stream and I

104
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,960
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to start up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ELC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

105
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,570
whatever well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't always want to do</font>

106
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,120
that so with MC first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can just specify</font>

107
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,340
a group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the important i can just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

108
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,560
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can receive a stream to just</font>

109
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,830
exits when it gets the first data packet

110
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,360
which is often just what you need but

111
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can also specify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how long it should</font>

112
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,750
run or how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets it should we see</font>

113
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:41,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">before it exits finally i should also</font>

114
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:45,340
say that someone has also written a web

115
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,990
interface to these tools so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can if</font>

116
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,789
you have this on a web server than you

117
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,680
or other people could go to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

118
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,950
server and check that if the web server

119
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:58,510
is able to receive multicast from them

120
00:05:53,950 --> 00:06:00,520
or perhaps from someone else and there

121
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,560
aren't a few sort of well known servers

122
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">out on the internet so we could check</font>

123
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you could receive from these</font>

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,680
different servers but you can also<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

125
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:12,460
a course the deploy your own server to

126
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,260
test multicast internally and one thing

127
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm working on at the moment in our</font>

128
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:20,340
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to have a number of nodes</font>

129
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:23,470
spread around the network and like every

130
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,810
half hour or whatever have the different

131
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,520
health ping each other in a mesh to

132
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:31,080
check that each of them can receive from

133
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,599
each other and collect historical data

134
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,520
but yeah please<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to that URL or talk</font>

135
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,300
to New York mail<font color="#CCCCCC"> me if you want more</font>

136
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,990
information

137
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,990
that's it
