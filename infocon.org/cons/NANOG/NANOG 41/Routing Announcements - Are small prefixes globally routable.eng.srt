1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,580
good morning i hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all are slightly</font>

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,059
more awake than I am we'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:11,550
this together I promise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm Todd</font>

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,230
Underwood and as usual<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm presenting</font>

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,560
the wonderful work done by people other

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,300
than me who really deserve the credit

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:21,180
but they are foolish enough to not<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,850
to come to Albuquerque so here um the

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,400
task that we were looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at Renesys</font>

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,900
spends a lot of time we run a route

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,279
collection infrastructure similar to

12
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,659
route views and we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> some commercial</font>

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,059
products on top of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they spend a</font>

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,770
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time talking to operators and we</font>

15
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,209
hear a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rumors one of the rumors I</font>

16
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,309
started hearing about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a year and a half</font>

17
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,379
or two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was lots of big</font>

18
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,879
carriers will route stuff more than you

19
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,940
know smaller than 24 so we're out 25

20
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,190
some people are even route 26 is well on

21
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,660
their network right like<font color="#E5E5E5"> no some little</font>

22
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,360
more propagated and their peers will

23
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,648
take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't seem right so I</font>

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,510
just sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ignored it for a while</font>

25
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,879
because the rumors run fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> and furious</font>

26
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,070
and most of them are frankly crap but

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,960
this one sort of kept going and so we

28
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,960
decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look into it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,030
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me tell you a quick analysis we did</font>

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,130
recently so first of all how do i define

31
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,479
globally routable this is actually

32
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,399
interesting and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

33
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,560
subject of another presentation whenever

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,570
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to it because I</font>

35
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,520
contend there is no global routing table

36
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,048
that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just what your customers</font>

37
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,100
haven't complained about yet and what

38
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:25,320
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have and that so and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually</font>

39
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,820
that one's really hard to do so when we

40
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,289
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> around to it will do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis</font>

41
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,000
and will show that none of y'all carry a

42
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,820
full table whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is you say in</font>

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,920
your marketing but so for this we needed

44
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,960
something simple so what's a full table

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,079
and what we decided was so we've got

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,449
about 225 at the time that this analysis

47
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,419
was done full tables coming from peers

48
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,479
so we said how about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 how about a 50</font>

49
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,920
unique a esas have this of our peering

50
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,479
set let's call that globally routable

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,640
just because it's a nice you can

52
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,689
threshold it and you can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

53
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,729
know we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about</font>

54
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,829
covering more specifics and you know

55
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,289
path stuff and is this is this you know

56
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this less specific really cover</font>

57
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,579
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> mote we're just just 50 that prefix</font>

58
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,829
just 50 very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see a curve</font>

59
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,929
here can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you can see the</font>

60
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,060
curb there it's kind of pain

61
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:14,480
thanks nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's breast cancer awareness</font>

62
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,430
month so it's pink<font color="#CCCCCC"> sea so pink is nice</font>

63
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,578
and you can see there's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

64
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">the number of prefixes that any one of</font>

65
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:24,769
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers agrees upon is well over</font>

66
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:26,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">300,000 that means the union of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unique</font>

67
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:29,870
prefixes that I see from my peers is

68
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:32,359
well over 300,000 but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as soon as you</font>

69
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,639
start threshold it right about five it

70
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:36,889
just flattens out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really so</font>

71
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,159
50 is very generous it's sort of the

72
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:41,540
midpoint of this asymptotic curve so you

73
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,599
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's look at the large</font>

74
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,970
prefixes that are seen by our pairing

75
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:49,129
sessions there's an interesting anomaly

76
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,069
here so first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of eNOS / 9</font>

77
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:53,750
through / 11 everybody sees the same

78
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:56,230
ones there's really not that many either

79
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:58,909
you have them or you don't and people do

80
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:01,939
and then and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it sort of tapers off</font>

81
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:04,129
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from 99.3 here</font>

82
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:07,189
you know all the way down to 96.1

83
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:09,679
there's still broad-based agreement

84
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:14,209
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically carry the same prefixes</font>

85
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,680
uh what's that um 73.1 percent in the /

86
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:19,159
aids that's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wacky right there</font>

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,500
are a total of 26 of them routed but

88
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:25,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">only 19 of those are carried by more</font>

89
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,939
than 50 of my peers so which ones aren't

90
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:32,409
globally routed well 6 / 8 and 63

91
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:35,720
through 68 / 8 and 13 / 8 and 24 / 8 are

92
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:38,149
the ones that some people carry but

93
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,228
almost none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you thankfully do because</font>

94
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,689
those are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not being announced</font>

95
00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:44,689
by the people who own them they're being

96
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:47,509
announced by 2706 specific internet in

97
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:49,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">Singapore and there's only three Renesys</font>

98
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:51,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">piers all of them small networks we will</font>

99
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">not change them here in public because</font>

100
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,500
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to shame my peers I</font>

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">rather sort of work with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them privately</font>

102
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,259
to correct these things my suspicion is

103
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:03,439
when I saw this it related back to some

104
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:05,599
work that Geoff Huston had done on sort

105
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">of transient / 8 announcements in</font>

106
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,909
transient<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcement so / 24 s inside</font>

107
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,709
of /<font color="#E5E5E5"> eights for spamming purposes I have</font>

108
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:15,500
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea if that's what these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are but it</font>

109
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:17,298
certainly looks suspicious to me so if

110
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,880
you see those coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from your customers</font>

111
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:21,719
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

112
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,490
asia pac region feel free to filter them

113
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,600
feel free to filter your customers for

114
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,250
what they're supposed to be announcing

115
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,230
just full stop if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like it</font>

116
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:32,490
that's that's sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so then so</font>

117
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,320
then so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was the big stuff so that</font>

118
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,640
made us feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> good okay we've got a model</font>

119
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,070
here we can sort of understand what's

120
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:42,030
going on great now let's start looking

121
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:44,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">at smaller stuff so 20 21 22 through 24</font>

122
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,320
it starts tapering off a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

123
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,600
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not surprising because many of</font>

124
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,030
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> rd aggregates and different people</font>

125
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,590
will carry just just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of traffic</font>

126
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,809
engineering different people will end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

127
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,909
getting announced different d aggregates

128
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,350
of covering announcements so it's not

129
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,810
surprising that you would see less

130
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:05,640
agreement here and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would expect</font>

131
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:07,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see a very sharp drop-off at 24 but</font>

132
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">i was a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit surprised at that</font>

133
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:14,580
number that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero it's not too it's</font>

134
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:17,669
203 there are 203 / 25 s that are

135
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">carried by more than 50 of my peers so I</font>

136
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,660
went into this pretty sure my colleague

137
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:24,330
Earl Jimmy Jeff ski was doing this work

138
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,100
and and I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the saying earlier</font>

139
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,539
you're not going to find much I mean I I

140
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,090
heard this but it's not going to be much

141
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,490
and admittedly<font color="#E5E5E5"> 203 prefixes is really</font>

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,190
I find fascinating is that they've

170
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:42,000
routing of these prefixes seems to be

171
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:45,210
almost entirely about Korea which was

182
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,869
and of course you know when you look at

183
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,159
some other big networks they really talk

184
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:15,900
about /<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24 s and and that's it so one</font>

185
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,690
question might be hasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it always been</font>

186
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,280
this way and why should we care<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

187
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:23,219
if it's always been true that there's

188
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,140
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> some little bit of smaller prefixes</font>

189
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,450
that are carried<font color="#E5E5E5"> around then then that's</font>

190
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay right it's sort of what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

191
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a substantial change in the</font>

192
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,710
last year in<font color="#E5E5E5"> October</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of 2006 we saw 29</font>

193
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,300
what we did was we<font color="#CCCCCC"> took our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peer set at</font>

194
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,070
that time which<font color="#E5E5E5"> was slightly smaller and</font>

195
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,140
we scaled the number of peers required

196
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,969
to threshold down to 30 and change from

197
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,969
50 just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same percentage</font>

198
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:48,840
and when doing that we get 29 prefixes

199
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:52,050
of this character routed globally last

200
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,810
year so that's an Eightfold increase in

201
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:58,200
the last year that that could just be

202
00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:00,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay but here's one of the concerns and</font>

203
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,610
this is the the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we</font>

204
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:06,090
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> see more prefixes routed of</font>

205
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,320
this character than previously were most

206
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,940
our friend a single provider in South

207
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,800
Korea so we could presumably figure out

208
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,540
why they're announcing them and why

209
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,280
people feel interested in carrying them

210
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,050
it could just be that the aggregates

211
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,820
carry so much traffic that people really

212
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,440
want the<font color="#CCCCCC"> D aggregates because it helps</font>

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,750
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the concerns that you'll see</font>

219
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:35,389
underlying a number of the presentations

220
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,039
here at<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanak this time is routing table</font>

growth the growth of the total number of

222
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,870

223
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:44,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those routes so the churn in those</font>

224
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,879
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the assumptions about routing</font>

225
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,550
table growth include some notion that we

226
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:52,009
won't route things smaller than 24 s so

227
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,779
if this barrier has been broken and is

228
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:55,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">being broken for economic reasons</font>

00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,990

<font color="#CCCCCC">becomes true that your networks are</font>

going to carry in the near future large

numbers of prefixes in the 25-26 god

234

assumptions about the routing table

growth for ipv4 are not valid and this

237
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:17,569
is cause for some concern so it's

238
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,240
important to end with doom and gloom so

239
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:22,910
that people feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid because fear is</font>

240
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,040
a great motivator and it will take<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

243
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:30,199
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is these are primal instincts</font>

244
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:31,670
when you are afraid you should eat

that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have are there any</font>

247
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,609
I that's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know yeah is that a</font>

question yes I'm Dan Blair with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco</font>

250
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:51,620
how long did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prefixes have to be in</font>

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:53,300
the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be counted so for us since</font>

252
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:58,100
we process updates I think the way we

253
00:09:53,300 --> 00:10:01,399
did this was carried at all so so with

254
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:04,220
one second be counted in this analysis

255
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:06,980
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Brett recall that I'm</font>

256
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,629
thrash holding 50 peers so so if it were

257
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,459
true that 50 of my peers got together

258
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:12,680
and agreed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry you know one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

these prefixes for one second you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

260
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,849
in a 24-hour period then certainly they

261
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,470
would count that so we did look these

262
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,970
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that these are actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mostly</font>

263
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,610
consistently carried and some of these

could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that South Korea has a</font>

yes I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'll find out Brad</font>
