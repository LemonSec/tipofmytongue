00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:07,080
okay hi my name is Tom shell with the

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,670
AT&T<font color="#CCCCCC"> labs and this is presentation is</font>

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,010
basically about maximum<font color="#CCCCCC"> prefix tripping</font>

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,309
and what happens when there's leaks on

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,439
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so just this kind of a</font>

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,810
disclaimer slide here to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">know there's you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,220
make up you know or say that you know

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad behavior of leaking is you know</font>

10
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,180
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be corrected by a</font>

11
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,439
feature it's still bad and you should do

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,439
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can to prevent it with</font>

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,000
filters and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but um you</font>

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,070
know leaks are still going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have and</font>

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,930
not everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets a filter sometimes</font>

16
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,879
things get missed sometimes things get

17
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,670
missed on customers also two different

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,440
scenarios happen so<font color="#E5E5E5"> option may be in a</font>

19
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,930
heavily paired environment that perhaps

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,849
the best solution would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be to perhaps</font>

21
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,050
allow a feature that could be a still

22
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,260
allow traffic at the forward without

23
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,550
things shutting<font color="#E5E5E5"> down so just disclaimer</font>

24
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">you should always filter as much as you</font>

25
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,000
can as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as possible but in the event</font>

26
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,349
that for whatever reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't it would be nice to have an</font>

28
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:05,339
alternative solution so so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact of</font>

29
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">beach p leaks were typically appear may</font>

30
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,689
leak you know either that could be

31
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,470
transit route or another pairs routes

32
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:12,990
basically something that shouldn't be

33
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,880
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there has really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of affects</font>

34
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,860
number one the most immediate is at

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,408
maximum prefix which is a feature that's

36
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,720
implemented quite prevalent in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

37
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,000
production world is applied on every

38
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,650
pair with a specific limit and in any

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,400
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of leak scenario what happens is</font>

40
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,020
that maximum prefix gets hit and the

41
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,430
session<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes down at that point and at</font>

42
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that point it requires some sort of</font>

43
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,320
human internet you know intervention or

44
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,970
could require that on some

45
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,199
implementations that can reset after a

46
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,298
certain amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes but typically</font>

47
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,369
when it happens you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it may involve</font>

48
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,020
humans getting involved in having to

49
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:47,250
call each other and have to reset every

50
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,460
individual connection at multiple

51
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,170
locations so it could be process

52
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,780
intensive and the other at impact of

53
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,820
doing a leak is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know people may</font>

54
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,200
actually accept the leak they may take

55
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,309
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they shouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have and</font>

56
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,500
they may start forwarding it through

57
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">your network and well that may seem like</font>

58
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,549
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> free to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know free transit or</font>

59
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,689
whatever chances are if<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

60
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">are accepting it they're most likely</font>

61
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:09,280
affording a good amount of traffic and

62
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,290
you may not have capacity

63
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,340
for it and then you run into other

64
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:17,260
problems so I took a look at like the

65
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:20,200
last several months and look from april

66
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,660
to September and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much a</font>

67
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,459
leak every month occurred um you know

68
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,709
typically they were short-lived but you

69
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:28,780
know that does happen quite a bit I mean

70
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:31,330
if you go on any of the mailing lists

71
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,580
and you typically see someone sending

72
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,680
out on IX mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's saying that hey</font>

73
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,480
we trip max prefix can you everybody

74
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,780
reset I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty commonplace</font>

75
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,790
and then there's actual feature of

76
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,650
maximum prefix which it's it's a good

77
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,630
attention you do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to restrict that</font>

78
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">in case there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem you certainly</font>

79
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,320
don't want to accept these routes so you

80
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,268
just said in a limit and once that not

81
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,160
limit succeeded it reacts by shutting

82
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:55,690
down the session but it's kind of like

83
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,250
the u.s. power grid where there's some

84
00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:00,250
sort of overload and everything shuts

85
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,290
down so another side effect to as well

86
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,910
as let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you did exceed other</font>

87
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,799
people's maximum prefix let's say you

88
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,630
did heavily going out your own routers

89
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,190
won't even tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason why the</font>

90
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,230
session went<font color="#E5E5E5"> down you'll typically see a</font>

91
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:14,079
message perhaps something like malformed

92
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,459
update I'll form two tributes and you'll

93
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:17,410
repeatedly see this every time the

94
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:19,269
session tries to come up so it doesn't

95
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,470
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you exactly why and if you</font>

96
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:22,390
see this happening to like multiple

97
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:26,109
pairs at once you may not be sure what

98
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:28,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened so I have some ideas on</font>

99
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,829
possibly making this better and it's

100
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an idea of where let's</font>

101
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:35,290
say you exceed maximum prefix um when

102
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:38,200
you exceed that not numeric limit

103
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,640
perhaps suppress anything learned after

104
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,108
that point that way you continue

105
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,510
forwarding the prefixes that you're

106
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:44,950
already aware of but it kind of requires

107
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,420
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of intelligence because a</font>

108
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,640
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things can have their happen</font>

109
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,309
after that prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> has exceeded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as well</font>

110
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,420
as it you also<font color="#E5E5E5"> are assuming that a leak</font>

111
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,730
is something that's a sudden that

112
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens within a small defined time such</font>

113
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:59,170
as 30 seconds or 60 seconds which

114
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,109
typically it is but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> never know so</font>

115
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea would be that you want to keep</font>

116
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the session up you want to keep</font>

117
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,709
forwarding traffic to what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

118
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,920
about and you just kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

119
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:11,410
ignore what was the league so the idea

120
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is perhaps you know you set</font>

121
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:16,329
a value some learn how you do today with

122
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,320
maximum prefix and you define<font color="#E5E5E5"> a some</font>

123
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,940
time intervals

124
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,589
particularly maybe one<font color="#CCCCCC"> minute before the</font>

125
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">event could occur in one minute after</font>

126
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:25,659
and whenever you do have a bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer that</font>

127
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,979
does exceed anything learned after that

128
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,580
point is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of marked as</font>

129
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:34,120
suppressed and is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> added into the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

130
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,409
decision process and if you can you know

131
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,880
you specify the time limit that says

132
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay someone just exceeded maximum</font>

133
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,420
prefix take all the prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I learned</font>

134
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,190
in the last minute throw them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out mark</font>

135
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,590
them as suppressed but continue to

136
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:49,600
process things like withdraws and things

137
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:52,119
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I had hair when it</font>

138
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,210
the prayer actually does go below

139
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,880
whatever the limit was at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point you</font>

140
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:00,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">know wait for some sort of period maybe</font>

141
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,830
one minute and request a route refresh

142
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,090
and if the pairing count is still below

143
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,099
you know if the prefix count is still

144
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,320
below what the maximum prefix is then<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

145
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">clear the pair is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and then rerun</font>

146
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,020
the beach<font color="#CCCCCC"> pete decision process and</font>

147
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,550
here's just a kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> image of</font>

148
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,150
what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would look like so you probably</font>

149
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,470
read that later but now but doesn't of

150
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,299
course there could be potential problems

151
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,730
with something like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example may</font>

152
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,100
more memory required on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router to</font>

153
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:31,390
hold this to do a compare the adjacency

154
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:34,000
in tables also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out</font>

155
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:36,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">a way to timestamps the HP updates which</font>

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,990
in most implementations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought they</font>

157
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,400
already do but so that's another thing

158
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,380
you have to worry about and what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

159
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,729
do about a pair<font color="#CCCCCC"> that keeps leaking up</font>

160
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,560
and down up and down do you want to

161
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,940
continually run this process for hours

162
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,620
and hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean who knows what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

163
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,180
impact is on the CPU so you may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

164
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,860
actually have another knob in there to

165
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,320
say if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened more than X</font>

166
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,390
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do want</font>

167
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,130
to shut it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down at that point or some</font>

168
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,960
other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of action and then of course</font>

169
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,850
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens if the leak is slow and</font>

170
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,370
gradual and not a sudden burst you know

171
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,960
there's not what you can do in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that case</font>

172
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,610
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some other additional things</font>

173
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are related to maximum prefix</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

174
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,200
are kind of gripes um you know different

175
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:13,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">unders have different implementation</font>

176
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">cisco they do their operation post</font>

177
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,620
policy juniper does it pre policy it'd

178
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:21,280
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice if both vendors could support</font>

179
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,660
both and<font color="#CCCCCC"> eric bell years ago used to say</font>

180
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,489
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can have a maximum prefix</font>

181
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,690
outbound you know even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though yes you</font>

182
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,960
should always be<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of what your</font>

183
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,330
filters are in control your own net

184
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,758
but perhaps like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> last-ditch effort is</font>

185
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,530
have a maximum prefix how about just in

186
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,419
case hopefully it's a one line command

187
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,888
it won't be too hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and then</font>

188
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:38,750
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also an issue and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco they</font>

189
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,180
have a unique regex bug which sometime

190
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,160
this summer somebody had a certain a s

191
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,020
path somewhat complex a s path

192
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">access-list that should have worked and</font>

193
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:50,568
it didn't and it was related to a bug so

194
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,860
be nice to get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed and then some</font>

195
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:53,900
other knobs that would be nice related

196
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,759
to beat recession management and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

197
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,349
would be things like it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great</font>

198
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">for to communicate and there's already</font>

199
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:01,430
been some drafts over the last few years

200
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,139
but I'm not sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what happened to</font>

201
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,880
them but the way I actually send a

202
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:06,759
message to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp peer that would show up</font>

203
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,530
in their syslog or some sort of a

204
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,840
logging event monitor on the router so

205
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,039
if you had a planned maintenance you

206
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">know you get in the router is going to</font>

207
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,919
go down you can send a<font color="#CCCCCC"> message every</font>

208
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,150
pair that would say something like okay

209
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,130
well reloading we're doing code upgrades

210
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,870
then be down for two hours here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,909
up the NOC find out what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on and</font>

216
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:30,979
be nice if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

that do things like administrative shut

down up here I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> use your imagination</font>

219
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:37,880
for why you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do that and</font>

220
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,289
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could say something to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pair</font>

221
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,990
like hey you're approaching maximum

222
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:43,610
prefix obviously you know you might want

223
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,620
to fix this and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually when the</font>

224
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">session is shut down for maximum prefix</font>

225
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,159
it would be nice if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually told</font>

226
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,360
you why rather than just sever the

227
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:52,490
session and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see some vague</font>

228
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,560
update messages and then you can say

229
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,710
things comical like pay your bills if

230
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,909
they have a page so that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

231
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,909
about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so any questions</font>

232
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,400
so have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to any of our</font>

233
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,530
favorite router vendors about this and

234
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,698
no not you<font color="#CCCCCC"> no sir i mean i would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

235
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,008
see something maybe like a draft or

236
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,300
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> get started and you know</font>

237
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,629
hopefully customers will say yeah this

238
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,800
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know real issue with</font>

239
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:29,569
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it happens</font>

240
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,039
frequently and you know it<font color="#CCCCCC"> shouldn't</font>

241
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:32,599
happen but it still does and maybe when

242
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,729
you just try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to at least have this knob</font>

243
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:44,060
in there but obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have to</font>

244
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:46,430
support it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Jeff Houston this is a</font>

245
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:47,930
relatively old conversation and

246
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,420
certainly not the first time it's been

247
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,670
brought up there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> various</font>

248
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:56,420
proposals kicking around<font color="#E5E5E5"> including high</font>

249
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:58,069
and low mark thresholds the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fundamental</font>

250
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,800
observation that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always being with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> max</font>

251
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,839
prefix is that when you exceed it is

252
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,540
tearing down the session the right thing

253
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:08,600
to do or is hobbling along a better

254
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,300
thing to do normally the way these

255
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,220
conversations have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been continued is</font>

256
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,529
that when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> trigger at that limit</font>

257
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,140
rather than tearing down the session you

258
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:20,450
simply don't accept prefixes that would

259
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,459
add<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the account you can accept</font>

260
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,959
updates on existing ones you have and

261
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:26,510
withdrawals but you wouldn't accept any

262
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:29,779
more prefixes until you get below<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

263
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,819
low-water threshold that conversation is

264
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:34,670
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> conducted with vendors over some</font>

265
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,050
years in various contexts and i think if

266
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,910
you look very hard you might find some

267
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:41,000
implementations<font color="#E5E5E5"> all it squirreled around</font>

268
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:44,060
somewhere it though is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still a matter of</font>

269
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,610
theology rather than engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

270
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:50,119
when you get a prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> league it's better</font>

271
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:52,010
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> zot the ore piya out of existence or</font>

272
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,350
simply continue with the prefixes that

273
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,450
got you to the limit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've seen</font>

274
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,600
proponents either way and no clear

275
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,920
answer it's a good point and I mean if

276
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,440
there are implementations out there and

277
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,790
be curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see them but um yeah I</font>

278
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,959
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's really the question if</font>

279
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,910
you're doing a pair with your having

280
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,140
multiple multiple gigs do you really

281
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,630
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rear out that because of a</font>

282
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,040
momentary misapplication of the filter

283
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:16,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">which may be corrected within several</font>

284
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,670
minutes but I guess it's if people

285
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:20,790
really want they should be asked

286
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,530
um the people who were<font color="#E5E5E5"> in favor of</font>

287
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,819
carrying down the session was the only

288
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,829
way you get the attention of the
