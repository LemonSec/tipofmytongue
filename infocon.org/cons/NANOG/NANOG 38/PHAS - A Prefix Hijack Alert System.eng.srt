00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
okay okay thanks so I'm I'm Dan<font color="#CCCCCC"> masse</font>

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,570
this is a joint work with UCLA and

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,090
University of Arizona and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,289
talk about a prefix hijack alert system

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:18,090
or our abbreviation<font color="#CCCCCC"> fats for the system</font>

6
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:19,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so a basic outline of what we're</font>

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,080
going to cover I'm going to talk a

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,939
little bit about the the problem of some

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,650
observations on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution space and</font>

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">then I'm going to present our main</font>

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,729
system which is up on the on the web now

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's what we call the route views</font>

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,540
based<font color="#CCCCCC"> faz service i'll give you an</font>

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,850
overview of how it works and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">more interesting thing is i can actually</font>

16
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">show you how you can use it now so in</font>

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,980
addition to reading your email you could

18
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,570
actually click on the website and and

19
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,288
give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a try while we're going through</font>

20
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,870
the talk and after we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the this</font>

21
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,550
sat on the website one nice feature of

22
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">faz is that there's a great deal of</font>

23
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,419
customization and we'll talk about how

24
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">you might be able to incorporate local</font>

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,000
site requirements to make a better

26
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,620
hijack alert system<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the basic</font>

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,329
problem in some sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm preaching to</font>

28
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,420
the choir here but bear with me for a

29
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:08,850
second so I set the context we've got

30
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,920
concern over bgp prefix origin hijacking

31
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:12,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">in this case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a faulty or</font>

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,790
malicious a s somewhere it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

33
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,580
announce address space it doesn't own

34
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,830
some sites will adopt this path they'll

35
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,350
route packets to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong is whom a</font>

36
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,070
spoof the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address drop the packets so</font>

37
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:30,839
forth so for example a s52 may decide to

38
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,850
originate a path to 129 8216 one of the

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,049
challenges here is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not</font>

40
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,479
clear to most people in the audience

41
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:39,210
that's a hijack<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a hijack that's</font>

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,250
my prefix the other AS IS my colleagues

43
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,100
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they should not be announcing</font>

44
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,630
this space but but we all know this this

45
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,369
kind of problem happens and that's what

46
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,920
we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to attack what we'd like to</font>

47
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,810
address so if this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hijack does</font>

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,079
occur some routers are going to select

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,520
the bad route via<font color="#E5E5E5"> as50 to other routers</font>

50
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,350
are still going to see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual</font>

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,339
importantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> colorado state in this case</font>

53
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,469
the owner of the prefix is unlikely to

54
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,878
see the bad route being being closer to

55
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,750
our own route we would hope our provider

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,519
picks us so we may not know a s52 is

57
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,970
hijacking our

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">fixed right now and and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a that's</font>

59
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,500
a real problem also although this is the

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,210
current set of set of affairs please

61
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,950
don't add a rule in into your

62
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,170
configuration saying don't accept a

63
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,239
route for this prefix from a s52 because

64
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,589
we do collaborate with them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

65
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,530
envision scenarios where it might be

66
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,120
valid to announce this route so so

67
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">overall we have a problem the legitimate</font>

73
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,929
origination there's two very related

74
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,760
hijacking problems that are that are

75
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,890
highly relevant and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll sleep easily</font>

76
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,200
detectable with the same system the

77
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,059
first is sub allocation hijacking so

78
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,280
here instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcing the prefix</font>

79
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,350
from the wrong a s I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to announce</font>

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,270
the more specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets will always</font>

81
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:08,030
follow the more specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> path longest</font>

82
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:10,040
match rule so if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want a hijack part of</font>

83
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:14,360
Colorado State's address space I could

84
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,160
announce the one 2982 138 / 24 people

85
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,650
who see the 24 will believe that will

86
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,609
prefer that over the 16 and you get part

00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:25,480
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> MySpace a much harder problem is the</font>

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,480
in this talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to restrict</font>

90
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,060
protecting the rest of the path to the

91
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,799
very end of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> path so the general</font>

92
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,870
attack is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can lie about any part of</font>

93
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,720
the a s paths packets will follow the

94
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:42,170
the incorrect path one thing I know for

95
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,060
sure is what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second to last AAS in</font>

96
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,700
the path for example a color out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

97
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:51,170
state I know who the upstream ISPs are

98
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:53,780
so if if that prefix goes from my as2 my

99
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,579
upstream ISPs great if it goes to

100
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,800
somebody else<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually detect that</font>

101
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,170
and report that as an error if you give

102
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,540
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data the main problem of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

103
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,750
is that the prefix owner doesn't see the

104
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,850
bad events and the remote users can't

105
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,739
remote a SS can't easily determine

106
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,650
what's bad without<font color="#E5E5E5"> input from the owner</font>

107
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:16,790
or from<font color="#CCCCCC"> assigned registry or something</font>

108
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,980
like that so so our basic assumption to

109
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,239
how to do prefix hijacking is just to

110
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,550
look at three<font color="#E5E5E5"> main functional</font>

111
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,109
requirements first if we're going to do

112
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,440
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the</font>

113
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,090
bad information

114
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,440
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system now we</font>

115
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,539
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do that we have data</font>

116
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,340
collectors<font color="#CCCCCC"> at ripe route views people</font>

117
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,110
have private monitoring so if a

118
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,969
hijacking event does occur there there

119
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,940
really are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> resources to see any</font>

120
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,410
significant event we need the ability to

121
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,719
distinguish between good and bad

122
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:45,430
information that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little harder</font>

123
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,290
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

124
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,540
remotely the person who really<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows</font>

125
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,670
this the best is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> owner of the prefix</font>

126
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,010
I know what my origins are I know when

127
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,900
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> change I know what my policy is so</font>

128
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,060
the person<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the ability to</font>

129
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,530
distinguish good from bad in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion</font>

130
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,110
the best person is really the owner of

131
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:03,940
the selves and then if you see the

132
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,380
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it's a problem last</font>

133
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing you need is incentive to fix it</font>

134
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,040
the person with the most incentive to

135
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,780
fix it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the owner themselves because</font>

136
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,470
they're directly affected they're the

137
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:16,239
ones losing the traffic so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really our</font>

138
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,950
objective it's just to connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad</font>

139
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,750
information with the prefix owner and

140
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">let the prefix owner detect and fix the</font>

141
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:26,560
problem it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fairly simple basic</font>

142
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,539
concept so we take data from route views

143
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,400
we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with an initial wrap table and</font>

144
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,280
then we apply updates as we get them

profuse there's a there is a slight

148
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,900
delay there and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep a</font>

149
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:44,049

prefix visible from refuse any time

151
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,340
there's a change in origin we don't

152
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,919
declare it good or<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad we simply report</font>

153
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,229
it to the interested party the owner

154
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,630
then applies some local rules and says

155
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:58,960
ah yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the change I expected I I</font>

156
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,490
added an ASI changed a policy or wait a

157
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,500

159
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,050
effective detect so the main concept

160
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:10,150
here is just collect the data from

161
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,520
public monitoring spots like rap views

162
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,979
ripe and provide the information back to

<font color="#E5E5E5">the prefix owner who can then definitely</font>

166
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,140
everywhere I say origin you can replace

167
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:28,270
sub allocation you can replace last hop

00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:58,390

changes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the origin and we say an</font>

that ends in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> s1 1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to 1 45 there may be</font>

187
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,150
a huge number of updates changing

188
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,040
attributes in the path changing some

189
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,679
other intermediate parts of the path but

190
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,200
the origin remains 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 1 45 until along</font>

191
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,890
comes the attack saying hey now eighteen

192
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,900
t is using a new path ending in a s52

193
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:35,110
sofas logs and origin change saying as

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:43,390
changed from 1 to 1 45 to 50<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 so this</font>

196
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:45,300
provides our base data and ideally we

197
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,979
would report this back to Colorado State

198
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,930
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems somewhat plausible</font>

199
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,070
because the vast majority of updates

200
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,010
you're going to see are not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

201
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,480
change your origin you hope but even

202
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,219
throwing out the vast majority of

203
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,860
updates the remainder is still a huge

204
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,750
volume so for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can have a</font>

205
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">peer that has multiple origins they're</font>

206
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,810
switching between origins we can see

207
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this on the order of thousands of times</font>

208
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,060
per day we can have the pier monitors

209
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,860
monitoring site losing connectivity so

210
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,690
the origin appears to go away appears to

211
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">come back and a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of oscillations</font>

212
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,580
just make this data by itself useful

213
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,740
once you've identified an attack has

214
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:24,520
occurred but too much to sand as a

215
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:26,050
detection system so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> level of</font>

216
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,880
aggregation we can do is we can say ah

217
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,100
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just look at the view from one</font>

218
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">pier let's take the combined view of all</font>

219
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,900
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers each pier provides</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

220
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,970

221
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,949
the origin<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen we call that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the instant</font>

222
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:41,320
origin set the origins used at this

223
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,790
instant to reach your prefix so for

224
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,820
example here I'm using three routers

225
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:49,780
from route views the AT&T router sees

226
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:51,580
Colorado State's origin is 1 to 1 45 to

227
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,270
sprint routers one in Canada one in the

228
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">u.s. see an origin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a s</font>

229
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:59,120
52 the other sees the origin of a s 1<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

230
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:03,469
1 45 so the scent is the union<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

231
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">three origins then and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scent i claim</font>

232
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,310
is going to change less frequent

233
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,739
frequently if you're a multi-homed site

234
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,660
if this is legitimate traffic for

235
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:15,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance the the bottom the bottom</font>

236
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:18,290
sprint router the 14 to 28 24 181 may

237
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:20,120
alternate between a s 1<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 1 45 and a s</font>

238
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,079
52 and it may flip back and forth

239
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:26,150
causing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> faz event over and over again</font>

240
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,550
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times per day or week the</font>

241
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:31,250
set<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself doesn't change in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that case</font>

242
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:33,349
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scent still contains two origins and</font>

243
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:37,640
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are your two valid origins</font>

244
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:39,200
that's all you need to know so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

245
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,270
step<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fast is sort of to say let's</font>

246
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,010
track this instant origin set and maybe

247
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,410
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a valid thing to report back to</font>

248
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:48,800
the user unfortunately that's still a

249
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:51,050
little too dynamic as well so the

250
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,630
instant origin set in some cases may

251
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,060
still change drought dramatically most

252
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:58,010
prefixes won't see the instant origin

253
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:00,619
set change unless you configure a new

254
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,450
policy at you know legitimately change

255
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,420
origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s which for most people you're</font>

256
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,880
not doing too frequently but some people

257
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,589
are doing this at a tremendous rate

258
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,270
we've seen in our data we seen some

259
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,840
prefixes that oscillate origins

260
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:17,630
literally thousands of times per day so

261
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:19,910
we had one last approach to kind of get

262
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data down to a manageable level on a</font>

263
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,260
level that's hopefully useful for

264
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,510
detecting origins we we borrow from BGP

265
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:29,480
route flap dampening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we say hey we</font>

266
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:32,120
can damp the instant origin set so our

267
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,370
objective is to detect a prefix hijack

268
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,950
our objective is to detect a bad origin

269
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:39,860
coming up so if somebody announces a new

270
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:41,600
origin for your prefix regardless of any

271
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,340
damping parameter<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

272
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,860
about it immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to be</font>

273
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,690
added to the instant origin set and as

274
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,600
soon as I get that information I forward

275
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:53,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it on to the prefix owner what I can</font>

276
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,870
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a little bit is when i take a</font>

277
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:59,390
prefix out of your origin set so every

278
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:02,210
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> your origin set changes i apply a</font>

279
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:05,360
standard route routing like damping

280
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,499
penalty the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time i wait before</font>

281
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">removing in a</font>

282
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:10,609
origin from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> asf depends on your</font>

283
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:13,999
penalty value so if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed quite</font>

284
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:16,399
a bit I'll delay removal by say 20

285
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:18,529
minutes you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed even more by 40</font>

286
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,799
minutes by an hour and so forth standard

287
00:11:18,529 --> 00:11:23,599
dampening kind of rules so dampening is

288
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,519
going to remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> the oscillation you see</font>

289
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:28,219

important notifications the notification

308
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:15,529
saying something brand-new is occurring

309
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:19,129
and most of the most of the oscillations

310
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:21,379
should be damped away what you lose is

311
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:22,819
if you switch origins and you

312
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:24,529
legitimately want to know when your old

313
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:26,539
origin went away or you legitimately

314
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:29,059
want to know when it attacks stops I'm a

316
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:33,319
longer hijacking your prefix but once

317
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,849
you're at that point you can pull the

318
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:37,269
data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get that in a more real</font>

320
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:43,459
alright so the resulting system is up

321
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:46,249
and running and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> snapshot</font>

322
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:47,929
of the main page<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what we're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

323
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:50,689
we're basically giving you a couple

324
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:52,970
services let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> compare so right now</font>

325
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:54,618
we're using route fused data and we're

326
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:58,279
tracking every prefix visible too

327
00:12:54,619 --> 00:13:00,739
obvious we have a set of origins used to

328
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,779
reach the prefix we have logs of the

329
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:04,669
origins changing we have the sub

330
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:06,709
allocations for the prefix we have logs

331
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:09,139
of the sub allocation changes new sub

332
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:10,878
allocation new you know new more

333
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:13,159
specific pops up a more specific goes

334
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,229
away we have the last hops for the

335
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,479
prefix and we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have logs and when the</font>

336
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:19,189
last hops are changing if you want to

337
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:19,779
see the current behavior of your prefix

338
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:21,730
you

339
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:24,160
simply log on to the fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> website click</font>

the click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the query button and we'll</font>

341
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,579
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last 24 hours for your</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was seen over the last 24 hours and</font>

345
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:36,610
if changes occurred you'll see

346
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:39,279
immediately when a new a s was added and

347
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,410
depending on on how frequently your set

348
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:44,399
changes you'll see when<font color="#CCCCCC"> a SS are removed</font>

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:50,680
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually useful but I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

if I'm under attack we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have an</font>

356
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:02,649
in real time and so you can log on

357
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,420
provide an email address for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your prefix</font>

358
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:05,889
in fact this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> public data for</font>

00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,469
anybody's prefix you're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

360
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:10,870
looking at and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> email you</font>

notifications every time the set changes

362
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:15,730
so we'll give you an initial set saying

here's the instant origin set for your

down the event logs in the more detailed

data and and hopefully diagnose and fix

a hijack attack what you get if you if

you signed up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the email</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> notification</font>

379
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:59,139
is a very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> text message format and</font>

380
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,910
this is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got last night</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

382
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:07,059
it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling me here's an</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">origin change and the origin set now</font>

00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:13,929
consists of only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s 3533 nobody was</font>

386
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:18,639
that set this is something that's

387
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,069
readable by a person but we aren't

388
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">really intending this to be primarily</font>

389
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:25,479
for people we're intending this to be

390
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:28,500
primarily prescripts so ideally the

391
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:31,360
script receives the notification<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now</font>

392
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,310
the thing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like about fouls is</font>

393
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,250
now you apply your local policy

394
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:39,010
so some examples of local policies you

395
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:41,740
might apply if it's a relatively fixed

396
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:43,420
set for instance my prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know the</font>

397
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,279
origins i know they're not expected to

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,050
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know the sub allocations i know</font>

402
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,779
configure that into my filter and say

403
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:57,760
look an alarm telling me that I'm

404
00:15:55,779 --> 00:16:00,520
alternating between one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my upstream</font>

406
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,710
me just discard that other alarms some

407
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,569
origin I've never heard about is

408
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:10,570
announcing my prefix immediately forward

409
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:13,180
that on to the NOC so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a nice</font>

410
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,500
simple script these kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of scripts will</font>

411
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,890
provide for you if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to download</font>

412
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,630
them off the site also anybody with any

413
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,400
knowledge of Python Perl and a little

414
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,230
bit of text formatting can can build a

415
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,689
similar script and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're less than a</font>

00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">date clearly a more interesting thing</font>

417
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,720
you might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is you say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

418
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,490
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting but maybe I'm</font>

419
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,260
monitoring a prefix that's not my own

420
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,750
maybe an important destination for my

421
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:37,540
customers and I may not exactly know

422
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:40,089
what the right origins are getting the

423
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:42,370
information saying prefix exchanged from

424
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:44,800
this origin to that might be interesting

425
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:46,720
it might be also be too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much data you</font>

426
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,510
might want to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah instead I'd like to</font>

427
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">compare this with name your favorite</font>

428
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:54,100
registry database so again a simple

429
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,560
policy run on your end allows you to do

430
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,570
that say hey I'm seeing origins that

431
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,959

with a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> build a fast</font>

data from within their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own private</font>

514

notifications need to be sent faz

520
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:34,899
provides this notification form at the

521
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:37,249
tracker writes them out a TCP socket and

522
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:39,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can accept them and do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever you</font>

523
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:41,839
want with them the the one running on

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,179
the website we call it faz notify email

525
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:46,908
so it accepts notifications from the

526
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:49,249
tracker it looks who's subscribe view of

527
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:51,259
the web page and if if a notification

528
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:53,119
comes in for a prefix and somebody's

529
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:56,149
email says I want to see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix a</font>

530
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,799
notification goes out to that email just

531
00:20:56,149 --> 00:21:01,609
as easily you can build one that sends a

532
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:03,379
text message rights to rights to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

custom notify message that that when

536
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:13,339
their data system goes through fast

537
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:15,469
tracker reports an event it's now going

538
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:19,428
to go into their private management

539
00:21:15,469 --> 00:21:21,919
system so overall here's sort of our

540
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:23,599
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> status right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now we've got the</font>

541

website up and running querying the

00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:29,269
prefix has been working since July with

543
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:31,940
some some early adopters and some

544
00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:33,679
private users I'm expecting we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoping</font>

545
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,109
that based on now a little more

546
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,200
publicity and a wider scale publication

547
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:40,968
will get a lot more trials we've had the

548
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,379
email addresses working in alpha test

549
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:46,249
for quite a while we made the link

550
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:47,958
public just a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks ago again no</font>

551
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:50,029
known issues in the early test we're

552
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:54,109
encouraging people for for feedback and

553
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:57,049
use you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that being said anytime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

554
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:58,369
roll it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a larger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system I'm I in</font>

555
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,839
the back of my mind I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this fear</font>

556
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:01,428
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now everybody's logging</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font>

557
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:05,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">the system and the website has crashed</font>

558
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:08,450
that should hopefully not be the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

559
00:22:05,379 --> 00:22:10,339
work in progress what we're doing next

560
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,160
is basically we're developing and

561
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:13,870
releasing more of these email

562
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,640
filters so when you get this nice little

563
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:19,080
text message you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can sync it with the</font>

564
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:21,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">irr you can apply it to your fixed set</font>

565
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,199
one issue that we believe is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

566
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:26,140
come up is better management for

567
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,720
large-scale users so currently the code

568
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:30,780
is great for somebody like me with a /

569
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,160
16 interested in tracking that prefix

570
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:36,490
behind the scenes the code base is

571
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:39,970
tracking all<font color="#CCCCCC"> 190k ish prefixes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen from</font>

572
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:41,800
refuse and certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have 500</font>

573
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefixes to manage you can subscribe</font>

574
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,149
I'll 500 the problem there is really an

575
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:49,060
interface problem and a notification

576
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:51,370
problem subscribing 500 will work but

577
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,200
i'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are operating at</font>

578
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,820
that level want<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nicer interface and so</font>

579
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,640
we'd love to discuss how we can help do

580
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,139
that we also plan to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> releasing the</font>

581
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,570
fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracker code if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to run</font>

582
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,040
this yourself and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're basically</font>

583
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,980
looking for feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the current</font>

584
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,270
system and if people are interested in

585
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,280
using it what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of future features</font>

586
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:12,639
would be would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> important for you guys</font>

587
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:16,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see so that's that's basically the</font>

588
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,010
the talk and then if you try it and it's

589
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,540
useful we would love to hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> from you if</font>

590
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">you try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not useful we'd also</font>

591
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:25,720
love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear you know what's what's the</font>

592
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:27,070
problem what could be fixed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

593
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,050
go on the page now you can also look at

594
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,820
statistics and see some of say the<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst</font>

595
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:33,490
offenders<font color="#E5E5E5"> for origin changes and that</font>

596
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,080
sort of thing so at that point I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

597
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:37,470
I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just open it up to questions if</font>

598
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,470
there are any

599
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:56,450
Mike I think

600
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,840
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all going I working on event</font>

601
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:17,240
notification obviously triggered some

602
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,639
light bulbs on this you're using email

603
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:23,120
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a notification system I wonder if you</font>

604
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:26,180
consider it looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> evil simple XMPP</font>

605
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:28,310
given that at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> former has</font>

606
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,900
actually a fairly elaborate filtering

607
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,240
mechanism built right into the

608
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">architecture which might at least in</font>

609
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,380
some cases be able to do some of the

610
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,700
things that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do ah</font>

611
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,590
yes actually we have and that's that's

612
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,170
one of the notify packages we'd like to

613
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:44,629
produce for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> website right now we</font>

614
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:46,760
started with email just for sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

615
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,140
low barrier to entry but that's that's

616
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:52,400
definitely a great point and something

617
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:55,810
we plan to look into hey Todd Underwood

618
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,860
Renesys so i'm aware of at least two

619
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:00,889
existing in one case very very

620
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:02,780
long-standing system that do similar

621
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:05,240
overlapping almost exactly the same

622
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,070
stuff in particular the ripe my asn

623
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,130
project so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wonder if you could comment</font>

624
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:12,110
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between this work in</font>

625
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:13,610
that work this is sort of a why did we

626
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">need another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of these and what makes</font>

627
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,300
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one better different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's</font>

628
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,550
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good point there there are related</font>

629
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,040
efforts on this you know ripe has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a my</font>

630
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:24,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">asn service and there's a number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

631
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,480
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think what</font>

632
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:30,950
really what we found as a distinguishing

633
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,020
service here is I'm not asking any any

634
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:35,270
provider or any base to actually make

635
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,820
the decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you so rather</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

636
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:39,950
sort of telling telling a site hey

637
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:41,720
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to i would</font>

638
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,090
like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check against you know these</font>

639
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">are my valide esas and introducing</font>

640
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:48,620
problems with well is that data

641
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:50,810
correctly modified was it updated we

642
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to take approach of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

643
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:55,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">get this data actually out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

644
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:56,720
user whether you want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to to</font>

645
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,670
track hijacks whether you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

646
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,810
compare it against a fixed list whether

647
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:01,970
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compare it against the</font>

648
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:04,190
policy database<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there's great</font>

649
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,210
trade-offs between all those and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

650
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,160
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going to find a solution</font>

651
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:10,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">that fits all sizes so what we were</font>

652
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,810
really seeking is an approach that gave

653
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,660
the most power and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most flexibility</font>

654
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:16,879
to the end user and also for some of the

655
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:19,100
ISPs we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we talked with</font>

656
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,380
they don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to rely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on an</font>

657
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,959
external service so if you want to run

658
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,670
tracker locally here's software that you

659
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">can actually run locally you can put it</font>

660
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,850
under your control feed in your private

661
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,740
data that you don't want anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else to</font>

662
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:33,709
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to feed in your private</font>

663
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:36,170
system so there's there's other great

664
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:38,060
related work on this I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> really the</font>

665
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,620
local customization the local control

666
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:43,639
would be what I'd say is the main

667
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:47,389
feature here hi under a robot<font color="#E5E5E5"> ships key</font>

668
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:50,000
ripe NCC oh my project was<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

669
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:51,890
mentioned here and yes it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very similar</font>

670
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you are doing I think you are</font>

671
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:56,720
taking slightly different approach in

672
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:58,670
that you move this flexibility and power

673
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,430
to the client rather than to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server</font>

674
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:03,860
as we do in my ascend we took this

675
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:07,370
approach because we felt that threshold

676
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,889
of installing something even if it's as

677
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:12,199
simple as procmail filters could be a

678
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:15,620
threshold too high to start using the

679
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:18,560
system so we try to capture most useful

680
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:22,729
use cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> instant standard filters that</font>

681
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:26,179
we provide through<font color="#E5E5E5"> a web interface and</font>

682
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:28,310
as you absolutely correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention</font>

683
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:30,560
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade-off and I would be very</font>

684
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:35,000
interested in your experience whether

685
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:38,690
people will up more for a simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> startup</font>

686
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,910
and less customization all these more

687
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:43,490
complex things and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of user</font>

688
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:45,770
groups as well yeah I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's</font>

689
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:46,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually right may ascend is for those</font>

690
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,220
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't aware you know it's it's a</font>

691
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:51,230
great service and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really is but I</font>

692
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,730
think we're achieving a similar thing

693
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:54,620
but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taken a slightly</font>

694
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,210
different underlining design philosophy

695
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:58,310
about where the customization lies and

696
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:07,220
there there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> good points on both</font>

697
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:09,440
sides there hi so I could see why you

698
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,150
might call this in origin is change

699
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,940
alert system but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure why</font>

700
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:16,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">you been you can call it a prefix hijack</font>

701
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:20,180
alert system because what about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case</font>

702
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:22,250
where you've got a malicious a s that

703
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:28,460
before it actually advertises the prefix

704
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:31,190
anywhere it first appends the legitimate

705
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,930
origin is then perhaps the legitimate

706
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:38,510
what you're calling

707
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:41,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">dais and then pre pens itself to the</font>

708
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:43,610
path before before advertising it on in

709
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:46,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact if you've got a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> militia say yes you</font>

710
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:50,689
don't know where that a s have started

711
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:53,630
right you just know then right now so

712
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:55,850
what we're talking about here so we have

713
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:58,460
work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> still needs a that's that's</font>

714
00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:00,649
still in progress for protecting later

715
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,390
in the path if you sign if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this</font>

as your hijack alert system<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:07,430
guarantee<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that if there's a sub</font>

719
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:12,560
hijack you this should see it if

720
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:15,140
somebody reports a false origin this

721
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:17,570
should see it if somebody reports a

722
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,310
false last hop this should see it if you

723
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:21,710
want to lie<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the third a s in the</font>

724
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:23,300
path yes this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to catch it</font>

725
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:26,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">but but I think there's actually quite a</font>

726
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:29,570
bit of value in in catching the you know

727
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,670
in first<font color="#E5E5E5"> catching the the sub prefix the</font>

728
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:34,070
origin and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the easy extension to</font>

729
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,540
the second hop in the path so so I don't

730
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,280
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> catch an origin</font>

731
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,170
from a malicious is because the

732
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,840
malicious is you're sitting at them at

733
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:44,600
the edge could start the a s path

734
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">however it wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to write the militias</font>

735
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,870
is can lie about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last two hops in</font>

736
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,750
the path right completely<font color="#CCCCCC"> make them up</font>

737
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:54,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and so that that this approach will</font>

738
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:56,420
not will not detect and we have further

739
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:59,750
work along those lines but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now that gets</font>

740
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:02,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">a the reason we're presenting this at</font>

741
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:05,240
this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what you as a prefix owner</font>

742
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:07,250
can definitively say is ah these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are my</font>

743
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,260
origins these are not my origins these

744
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,900
are my sub prefixes these are not my sub

745
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:13,730
prefixes these are my next hops that

746
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,490
gets a little fuzzy when say your origin

747
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:19,160
is AT&T and you have you know many many

748
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:23,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">next tops but in my case of Colorado</font>

749
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:26,060
State there's two and detecting the rest

750
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:27,770
of the path is a great problem and this

751
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,659
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a step toward that and at</font>

752
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:32,500
least forcing the the attacker up there

753
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:35,510
in addition many of the events are not

754
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:37,340
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> well there's malicious</font>

755
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:40,100
attacks and those unintentional attacks

756
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:42,560
and unintentionally the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance that i</font>

757
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,290
append the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> two a s is correctly and</font>

758
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:48,320
announced the right the wrong route can

759
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:50,600
but but certainly for the configuration

760
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,340
errors i think we catch those and we

761
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:56,179
raised the bar for the hacker definitely

762
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:58,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want to either</font>

763
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:01,460
just be the more to word thyroid<font color="#E5E5E5"> it said</font>

00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:04,670
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question I think it's like no</font>

low barrier to entry to detect the

766
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:10,700
origin changes and lots of changes the

<font color="#CCCCCC">fact is however bgp does give you the</font>

770
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:21,890
just that you know there's more work to

771
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:26,120
get done regarding to how you detect

772
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:28,250
valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus you manage changes but the</font>

774
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:33,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provide data to the end users</font>

777
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:45,080
and any centralized the decision system

778

to tell the truth<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the false all</font>

779
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,939
right Doug Montgomery nest and did you

780
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:52,610
tell us how many events the system is

781
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:56,000
detecting a day Oh independent of

782
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:58,340
subscribers just so subscribers who is

783
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,400
in the dozens at the moment job but will

784
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,500
open independent of subscribers is the

785
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:06,260
system detecting so i can give you just

786
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:08,510
a snapshot from the the thing up<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so</font>

787
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:11,260
for instance here i'm tracking origin

00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:14,150
alarms this was for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24 hour period and</font>

00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,260
based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> raf use data this is a</font>

00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:19,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">little hard to read but there were a</font>

total of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5364 origin alarms during that</font>

792
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:26,780
24-hour period of those there<font color="#E5E5E5"> were about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">1100 prefixes that generated one alarm</font>

794
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:32,660
saying hey one addition to the set well

795
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:36,080
actually one notification saying you're

796
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:38,060
set changed one time even with the

797
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,889
damping and this may be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> down this may</font>

00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:42,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tune the damping algorithm</font>

799
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:46,220
there were 35 prefixes on that day that

800
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:48,740
experienced between 11 and 20 instant

801
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,710
set changes on that 24-hour period

802
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:54,320
meaning also probably oscillation a to

803
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,490
be a to be a to da to be maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

804
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,200
damping parameters weren't aggressive

805
00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:00,080
enough there

806
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,590
did is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay did did you say you're</font>

807
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,809
currently using<font color="#CCCCCC"> three route</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view sources</font>

808
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:07,699
we're currently we're using so my slide

809
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:09,200
example use<font color="#CCCCCC"> three route few sources but</font>

810
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:13,279
right now we're taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the full wrap</font>

811
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,730
use data so although<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think from from</font>

812
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:18,649
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many sources Ralph</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> news sources</font>

814
00:33:18,649 --> 00:33:23,178
collected data from Oliver healthiest

815
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:25,100
I'm certain at this point what's on the

816
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:28,490
web is using at least the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ralph use</font>

817
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:31,699
Oregon collector which is 4444 five ish

818
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:35,299
peers we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other route views</font>

819
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:36,950
data in there as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you extend</font>

820
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:40,100
up to all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rowdiest peers you're</font>

821
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:42,350
talking small hundred of routers that as

822
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,330
a last question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering if</font>

823
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,668
you've looked at how the number of

824
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,879
alarms might be affected from by the

825
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:52,669
number of potential collection points<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah</font>

826
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,519
so interestingly they it the preliminary

827
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:57,620
data is is suggesting that even with the

828
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,389
route<font color="#E5E5E5"> views Oregon enhancing it with</font>

route views wide collector or other

830
00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:04,610
collectors isn't giving us statistically

831
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,500
significant new data now that maybe I

832
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:09,440
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a long-term enough study</font>

833
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:12,530
there to make any you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know don't take</font>

834
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:16,040
that as preliminary data at best so it's

835
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:18,889
suggesting that maybe we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

836
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,540
collectors there's a different great

837
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:23,270
question on how do the collectors<font color="#E5E5E5"> affect</font>

838
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:25,790
this and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have all the data for</font>

839
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:27,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">that yet we're running short on time so</font>

840
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:28,369
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut it off to people who</font>

841
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:33,109
are currently in line if you're not in

842
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:35,149
mine sorry so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite awake yet so</font>

843
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:36,469
bear with me I may have kind of paused

844
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:40,368
out on something you may have already

845
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:42,138
covered but this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot</font>

846
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:44,210
of people have been spinning cycles

847
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:46,369
thinking about for a while from

848
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:50,149
different perspectives and have you

849
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:51,740
looked at I'm you've got all the data

850
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:54,529
there but yeah it's more of a like an

851
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:57,319
opt-in kind of notification system<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

852
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:59,869
is cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like I that's great as</font>

853
00:34:57,319 --> 00:35:01,730
more geared toward people monitoring the

854
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:05,420
propagation origination of the room

855
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:07,760
prefixes right right looking at from the

856
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,370
other angle did you guys give it a

857
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,100
consideration

858
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:12,990
into like the entire origin set the

859
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,930
entire BGP routing table from a

860

collective s originating said because I

861
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,690
mean there are other people who are more

862
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,970
concerned about not necessarily how

863
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:23,190
their pre features may be originated by

864
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:26,730
someone else but<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are</font>

865
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:28,350
concerned about I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're working in</font>

00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:31,650
a destination based environment right

867
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:35,040
that other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people's asses are being</font>

869
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,340
do you see my point yes definitely and

870
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:40,819
because I mean there may be I mean

871
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:43,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a dis a great tool for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opt-in</font>

but there's a superset of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

873
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,370
functionality here that would be very

874
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:50,069
useful to community large just to be

875
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:56,100
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some type of candidate</font>

want your down stream's trying to serve

00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:06,480
to a bogus announcement right guys look

880
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,279
at those challenges in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

881
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,110
know the original computational overhead

882
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,540
is pretty large but then it narrows down

883
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:15,780
really quick yes and actually what we

884
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:17,130
have so so really for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that question so</font>

885
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:20,340
this is kind of reinforcing your own

890
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:31,380
has never but so what we actually have

891
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:35,100
is the data the question is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

892
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:36,450
effectively get the data out and and do

it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right speed and the right</font>

894
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:41,759
format we're looking at that what we

895
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:45,020
have right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's easy to pull one</font>

prefix if you want to pull the whole set

897

the data is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being collected just the</font>

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,500
have that nail Daniel are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys uh</font>

901
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,580
are you I just send email to the authors

902
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,110
of the paper because I saw the paper

903
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,700
when I first came out and I was like oh

904
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:03,150
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is cool someone else is thinking</font>

905
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:06,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the same thing so are you guys</font>

906
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:08,520
open to suggestions on how very much<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

907
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:10,290
that's where we were open to suggestions

908
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,930
and collaboration and we really want to

909
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:15,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know we're coming at this you know</font>

910
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:17,879
as as hopefully somewhat clue full but

911
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,080
you know academic research and and the

912
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,010
more input we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this</font>

913
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,630
Community the better I think we can

914
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:25,120
the tools what's the avenue of

915
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:27,160
communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah leashes email address</font>

916
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,290
yeah there's an email address on the

917
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,629
website that'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the list that'll hit</font>

918
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:37,900
hit all of us and myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> Leisha bitch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

919
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:40,420
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay uh Jolie egli University</font>

920
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:43,480
of organ just to be clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the</font>

921
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:46,750
data set you're talking about in the

922
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,750
prior question that's a rub use to

923
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:52,450
because that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MRT formatted yeah</font>

924
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:55,840
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right data set that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop</font>

925
00:37:52,450 --> 00:38:03,069
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> U of O right and that's 45</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pairs</font>

926
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:05,830
or 44 yeah about that the dump one from

927
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:10,390
the original<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ravis is about 70 the</font>

928
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:15,069
moment so on also i'm still Todd from

929
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:17,440
Renesys just to back up your claim<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

930
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">question was how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many feeds of what</font>

931
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,470
character do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to find all of</font>

932
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,490
these and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a and I just wanted to</font>

933
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,950
back up your claim that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

934
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:29,950
surprisingly few the we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing</font>

935
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:31,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">this for a long time too and for finding</font>

936
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:34,750
unauthorized originations unauthorized

937
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:37,420
up streams partial unreachable ax t you

938
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:39,340
know d aggregations the basic things

939
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:42,580
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want to alert on we found</font>

940
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:44,680
that as few as 20 to 40 full tables from

941
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:47,350
relatively well selected peers catch all

942
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,330
of those so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and going back in</font>

943
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,950
time when we downsample are pure set

944
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:54,040
that's exactly what we find<font color="#CCCCCC"> to is that</font>

945
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:56,379
you don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 or 200 peering</font>

946
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:59,529
sessions you actually need somewhere

947
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:01,450
between 20 and 40 so I agree with you

948
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,190
all just putting on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the academic hat for</font>

949
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:05,319
a minute i would restate it slightly as

950
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:07,060
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see it we don't see a</font>

951
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:11,410
significant change by the addition of

952
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:13,779
more peers I'm missing a lot even<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

953
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:16,600
say i look at topology from a route

954
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:18,310
views perspective I'm if I try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to draw</font>

955
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,410
the topology<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm potentially missing a</font>

956
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:22,960
large number of peer-to-peer links that

957
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,940
that aren't going to show up there so I

958
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">I agree with you but I would restate it</font>

959
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:30,640
slightly as I don't see a benefit by

960
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:32,020
adding more peers I'm my speculation

961
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,589
would be I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing much or what</font>

962
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,960
I'm missing is not significant

963
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:38,450
but so so let me let me restate more

964
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:41,390
precisely what what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> was took our</font>

965
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:44,029
existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer set of 150 or so full</font>

966
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:45,650
tables and down sampled at a couple

967
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:48,380
different times to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar</font>

968
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,360
events and tried to see well right which

969
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:52,160
doesn't answer the question of are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

970
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,530
just still missing massive amounts of

971
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,850
stuff but from the existing peer set

972
00:39:54,530 --> 00:40:00,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">down sampled to 15 to 50 or so we see</font>

973
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:03,650
all of any right for peer-to-peer

974
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,230
lengths the more the better you need you

975
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:08,920
know many more than 150 full tables yes

976
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:12,700
but yeah I think we're basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree</font>

977
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,700
thanks you thanks a lot
