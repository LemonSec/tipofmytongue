00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:06,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright thanks um I'll just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dive right</font>

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:07,859
in let me know if you can't you have

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,889
trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing me just you know wave</font>

4
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:13,129
your hand in the back there I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:17,369
how far this will carry and there's no

6
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:19,650
portable mic<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so I'll try to get</font>

7
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,539
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very last slide as quickly as</font>

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,778
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible because the bulk of this</font>

9
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,490
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is intended to motivate the</font>

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,429
discussion which will hopefully come

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,729
right after I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been working on windows</font>

12
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,829
networking about 11 years and the past

13
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:36,898
six of those years have been spent on

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,050
rewriting the networking stack which

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,870
will ship in Windows Vista so i'll be

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:46,860
talking a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit about the out of</font>

17
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:49,339
box changes in behavior for<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,110
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows desktop that runs vista</font>

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,120
I'll also talk a little bit about some

20
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,280
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the capabilities that are there under</font>

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,510
the covers but that are not turned on by

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,699
default along the way I'll talk about

23
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,128
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the lessons we've learned about</font>

24
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,979
the approaches we took to making these

25
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:11,930
huge changes and where I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font>

26
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:15,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go from here based on those lessons</font>

27
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:20,700
so first a quick look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the timeline so</font>

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:23,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">I started to work on the design in 99 by</font>

29
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:29,070
two thousand one we had in our first

30
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:33,299
milestone mid-2002 we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP data</font>

31
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:36,389
exchanges up and running late 2003 we

32
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,610
had the new stack in the main bills for

33
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">Windows meaning that every install every</font>

34
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,479
install of the pre-release<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw has had</font>

35
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,990
the new stack up and running so a couple

36
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,390
things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point out here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first of all</font>

37
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,009
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the new stack hat was ongoing at</font>

38
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:55,320
the same time we were working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows</font>

39
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:57,030
2000 XP server 2003 XP sp2 as part of

40
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,490
why it took so<font color="#E5E5E5"> long but then secondly</font>

41
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,070
also that we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of fine-tuning</font>

42
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,640
the behavior of the stack for the past

43
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:09,239
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years so a lot of what you see</font>

44
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">already reflects what we've learned from</font>

45
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the deployments that we've had both</font>

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,060
internally<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

47
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:18,310
across the beta programs that we've had

48
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,320
those lessons are continuing up until

49
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,020
this very moment in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to change</font>

50
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide deck Justin now because we had</font>

51
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,210
changes that affect what I'm going to

52
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,190
say today as recently as this past week

53
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:35,230
these are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys who have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

54
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:37,090
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the new networking stack you</font>

55
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,100
can imagine this grew from a team of

56
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,780
about a couple people doing the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

57
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,380
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture you see in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> front of you</font>

58
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:47,380
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so what's new I mentioned</font>

59
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:50,410
earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> that v6 is on by default that</font>

60
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:53,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that Windows desktop will discover</font>

61
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,120
v6 connectivity if it's behind a NAT it

62
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,660
will configure a serato address for

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,630
itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fit the Texas 64 router</font>

64
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,460
it'll pick up a 64 64 address and so on

65
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,769
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth up through native v6</font>

66
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,050
connectivity there are a bunch of other

67
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,970
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them I'll talk</font>

68
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,760
about today so i won't go into detail on

69
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,620
them on this slide we have built-in

70
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,019
support for equal cost multipath routing

71
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,060
meaning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you have if a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> windows</font>

72
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,090
machine sees equal cost or routes to the

73
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,670
same prefix it'll actually multiplex its

74
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,530
traffic over them black hole router

75
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,239
detection which has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> historically a</font>

76
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,990
big one for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of view of</font>

77
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,970
support costs is enabled by default

78
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:37,060
we've changed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the set of options</font>

79
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:39,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we negotiate by default on with TCP</font>

80
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,800
window scaling is always negotiated by

81
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:43,960
default as is as our selective

82
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,600
acknowledgments and then we've upgraded

83
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,270
the algorithms that we use for

84
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,510
congestion control and loss recovery so

85
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:54,640
we're we're now in New Reno stack<font color="#CCCCCC"> F RTO</font>

86
00:03:52,510 --> 00:04:01,090
support is enabled by default as well as

87
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:03,700
de sac our old ephemeral<font color="#CCCCCC"> part assignment</font>

88
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:07,060
used to assign parts from 1024 all the

89
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,920
way up to 5000 that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed so now</font>

90
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,540
it's compliant with them the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aspects</font>

91
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,679
in that area meaning it starts from

92
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:16,988
about 49 k and goes up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 64</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> K and then</font>

93
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,140
finally there across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board there has</font>

94
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:22,239
been a fairly pervasive focus on getting

95
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,060
rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of registry keys so I kind of left</font>

96
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,400
earlier

97
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,860
and someone said maybe folks would just

98
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,950
go turn off ipv6 in the registry because

99
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,169
that's not that's not the way it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

100
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,669
so as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as possible we try to figure</font>

101
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:37,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">out what the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right thing is to do</font>

102
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:41,630
dynamically and team the stacks behavior

103
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:44,450
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly so that's it for the stuff</font>

104
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:47,840
that is turned on right out of the box

105
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:50,719
in addition there's quite a lot that we

106
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,669
put in that we left disabled either

107
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,860
because we didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a compelling</font>

108
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:57,169
customer case for it or because the

109
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,000
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> implications and the</font>

110
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:02,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure wasn't quite there yet or</font>

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">for any number of other reasons one is</font>

112
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:09,050
that ecn is configurable it was actually

113
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:12,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">on by default</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in some of the earlier</font>

114
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:15,650
betas and just based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issues that</font>

115
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:18,200
we've seen with various equipment from

116
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,780
vendors not working or kind of choking

117
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:24,080
when it sees<font color="#CCCCCC"> on ecn bits we've scaled</font>

118
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:26,659
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> back a little bit it's a strong</font>

119
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,090
host model meaning by default will only

120
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,800
send out an interface will only use

121
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,619
source addresses on the interface which

122
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,310
they are signed we you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

123
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,410
configure the week host mode as well in

124
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,380
environments where that's important I'll

125
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,880
skip over a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

126
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,250
trying really hard to get to that last

127
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,409
slide in the amount of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have /</font>

128
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,350
socket we have extended<font color="#CCCCCC"> statistic</font>

129
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:54,590
support that means essentially that you

130
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:57,050
can turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> on TCP east at the stats mabe</font>

131
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,510
on any given connection and look in

132
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,310
detail at what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on from the point</font>

133
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:05,360
of view<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the congestion algorithm flow</font>

134
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,830
control and so forth connection offload

135
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,620
is built in if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardware</font>

136
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,440
that supports it and then we support

137
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,000
attempting IQ second all traffic so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

138
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,740
can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the machine into a mode where</font>

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,740
whenever it's communicating with the

140
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,419
pier it will always<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to negotiate</font>

141
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,190
IPSec and if it succeeds it will proceed

142
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:27,260
in secure mode otherwise it will fall

143
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:31,099

case study looking at what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

146
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,060
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through in getting to the point</font>

147
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,490
where

148
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:42,389
we felt comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> in turning on ipv6</font>

149
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:44,400
by default you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this as</font>

150
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:45,870
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in multiple phases the first</font>

151
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,299
phase was where we were doing our

152
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,730
experimental bootstrapping we had an

153
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,710
add-on for windows 2000 that you could

154
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:56,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">download and install that had a cute</font>

155
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:58,289
that added ipv6 capabilities and we use

156
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:01,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">that to do early self-hosting improved</font>

157
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:04,440
it in XP sp2<font color="#E5E5E5"> in windows server 2003 and</font>

158
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:07,440
right now you know we have we well not

159
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,020
public 64 but public<font color="#CCCCCC"> teredo services so</font>

165
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,940
identified and tackled a lot of issues

<font color="#CCCCCC">that you could use v6 in a realistic in</font>

a real way so native ipv6 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sattar</font>

172
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:45,330
them fixed so that we could at least do

173
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:49,650
our internal deployments absorbing ipv4

174
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:51,120
and ipv6 in dual stack mode things have

<font color="#E5E5E5">gotten a lot better there's still a</font>

176
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,750

<font color="#CCCCCC">when you start looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

179
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:05,330
equipment but currently customers

180
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,289
actually can start to look at doing ipv6

181
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,240
deployments at least on a limited scale

182

<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology that's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">currently available phase three is</font>

184
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,960
widespread deployment and by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

185
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,780
getting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where we can turn</font>

186
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,638
it on by default for everyone which is

187
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:25,349
the case which has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been the case since</font>

188
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,660
Windows Vista bid beta 2<font color="#E5E5E5"> and secondly</font>

189
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,510
actually being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run in an ipv6</font>

190
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,820
only mode so we have a growing number of

191
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:35,760
desktops on our corporate network that

192
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:38,820
basically only get ipv6 connectivity and

193
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,409
we make we make we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this so</font>

194
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,169
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can identify what are the things</font>

195
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,180
that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> built-in dependencies on ipv4</font>

196
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:49,250
so we can find those dependencies and

197
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:53,069
fix them before our customers find them

198
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,630
what have<font color="#CCCCCC"> we learned the hard problems</font>

199
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,550
you have to that you have to find those

200
00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:00,020
early and the only way to find them is

201
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:04,079
to get code out there up and running I'm

202
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:06,660
curious just by show of hands how many

203
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:13,110
folks here have these six hosts on their

204
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:17,130
networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah so thinking it would</font>

205
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:19,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a higher number but the key lesson</font>

206
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,029
here is that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a v6 host</font>

207
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,770
on your network you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

208
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:24,779
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you will have them soon if</font>

209
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,279
you're in operator because as soon as

210
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:31,110
windows vista ships you'll start seeing

211
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:33,060
this v6 traffic on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks the</font>

212
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,870
second lesson figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the right</font>

213
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions are and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

214
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what are the questions that</font>

215
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,870
you really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer in order to be</font>

216
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:46,529
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a simple yes no decision on</font>

217
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:48,660
deployment in our case<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to look</font>

218
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:51,060
at a wide range of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are the</font>

219
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,339
key applications that users expect to

220
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,469
work both<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the desktop as well as on</font>

221
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:58,070
the server in order to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a realistic</font>

222
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:01,350
story for supporting an ipv6 deployment

223
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:03,480
and that applies both in the consumer

224
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,180
operating system you know folks you know

225
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,770
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PCs at home as well as in</font>

226
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,900
a corporate environment and the answers

227
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,029
are very different so it's important to

228
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,579
figure out what the environments are you

229
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:16,650
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support and start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting your</font>

230
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,900
hands dirty and getting things<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

231
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:23,069
up and running qualifying equipment and

232
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:26,520
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is an ongoing effort for us</font>

233
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:28,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we still find issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with equipment</font>

234
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,720
you know in environments that have

235
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,790
issues with ipv6 but we're at the point

236
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,470
now where we're comfortable with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

237
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:38,939
current configuration of Windows Vista

238
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:41,160
and RC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 and RC 2 and v6 is enabled by</font>

239
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,680
default the bulk of hosts will get v6

240
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,890
connectivity via to raid 0 which means

241
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:50,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if they're behind a NAT will</font>

242
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:52,890
actually turn ally pv6 inside UDP now

243
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:55,529
tirado is a special case because it

244
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:56,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">never actually registers addresses in</font>

245
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,720
the DN

246
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:01,359
and simply having the Teredo address

247
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,370
will not cause you to use quad air

248
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,769
records from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS I'll talk about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is currently the primary use</font>

peer-to-peer applications applications

254
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,600
that have their own mechanisms for

exchanging IP addresses ipv4 as well as

we'll ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> both a and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> claudia records</font>

258
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,339
and there was a presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> i believe</font>

259

the impact this would have on the DNS

of all this discussion only<font color="#E5E5E5"> arises when</font>

274
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:25,450
you actually have a global ipv6 address

by<font color="#E5E5E5"> default the DNS clients in Vista will</font>

when it gets back an authoritative

quad a query to that specific server in

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,829
general what we expect is that this will

00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:56,370
result in a significantly smaller than

<font color="#E5E5E5">algorithm works fairly well for</font>

291
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,350
mixed-motive deployments where you have

<font color="#E5E5E5">both the v4 and v6 records in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

293
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:20,100
now what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> this actually mean in</font>

294
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:22,170
practice on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the public network an</font>

295
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,020
application will typically only have a

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:27,630
global v6 address when some or rather a

297
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:30,839
node will only have a v6 address when

298
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:33,060
some application is using<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 Torito</font>

299
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,210
has this logic in place where it tries

300
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:37,829
to configure an address it tries to

301
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:39,420
activate its to radio ipv<font color="#CCCCCC"> six address</font>

302
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:42,540
just in time basically when an

303
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:46,680
application explicitly tries to use to

304
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:48,900
raid 0 now an additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> change we made</font>

305
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,630
which was even more conservative is that

306
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,850
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> global address you have is</font>

307
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:56,370
after 80 address we won't send any

308
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,920
quality queries at all so this really

309
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,890
scopes down the use of ipv6 in the

310
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:05,370
default mode in networks where there is

311
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:07,620
no native v6 or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 62 for deployment it's a</font>

341
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:26,819
where we made such a big step is in the

00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:11,439
that's what we've seen so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in</font>

425
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:15,130
practice and the deployments that we've

426
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,669
had have largely the feedback from our

427
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:20,529
beta testers has largely been ecstatic

428
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:22,419
we've also had feedback from service

429
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:24,760
providers who have said yeah well you

430
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:26,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we've seen a spike but the people</font>

431
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,960
who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the benefit are</font>

432
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,480
pretty happy with

433
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,300
but that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the expectation</font>

434
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,370
naturally is that when if everyone

435
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,530
internet if everyone on a network has

436
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,479
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> auto-tuning an auto tuning</font>

437
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,250
stack what you get is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone we</font>

438
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,190
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the same share of bandwidth</font>

439
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:48,570
which is what the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP flow</font>

440
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:52,800
control in general so the challenge here

441
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:54,510
as in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous case is how do we</font>

442
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,990
actually close the feedback loop how do

443
00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:00,060
we monitor you know the behavior of an

444
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,430

445
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:05,100
basis so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we understand you know</font>

446
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:08,030
better how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> design the end host</font>

447
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,020
behavior based on the requirements and

<font color="#CCCCCC">within the network infrastructure that's</font>

450

by basing the windows that they use not

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,840
very unfair to classic TCP full flows

489
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,270
and incorporated into the operating

490
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,970
stock in a in a way which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only</font>

491
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:07,270
fair but also preserves a significant

492
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,860
amount of the benefit so what we ended

493
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,590
up with is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we call compound</font>

494
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:15,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP the algorithm is based on some work</font>

495
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:16,899
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft Research Asia did the it</font>

496
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:19,720
combines both the delay based window

00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,330
with a loss based window the idea is

498
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,930
that as you when your window is smaller

499
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,970
or when there's less buffering in the

500
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:29,920
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lost based component of the</font>

501
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:33,070
window dominates so we behave more like

502
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:35,650
a regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP and as your window gets</font>

503
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,899
larger or as the delay variations become

504
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:40,030
more detectable to start behaving more

505
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:45,330
like a delay based<font color="#CCCCCC"> CCP immunity we allow</font>

506
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:49,060
you to refill you know capacity faster

00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:51,580
so results the same ms<font color="#CCCCCC"> con folks who saw</font>

00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,820
about another doubling in through /

512
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:02,500
which I'm again is not that surprising

513
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,389
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at the at the actual</font>

514
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,880

515
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:09,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">amount of time that TCP spends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

516

ramping up into high bandwidth

517

high-capacity pipes so we also have done

some engagements with the UK<font color="#CCCCCC"> mrd and</font>

today is IPSec everywhere so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:28,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will actually try to use negotiate</font>

570
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:31,100
we have a mode where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will try to</font>

571
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:32,780
negotiate IPSec between any pair of

572
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,939
hosts but that's not enabled by default

573
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,940
it's a latent capability so you can go

574
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:40,130
configure it but it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be what we'd</font>

575
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,470
really like is for actually to actually

576
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:44,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">always attempt IPSec by the fall what</font>

577
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,159
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does it look like</font>

578
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:47,750
and deployment you know what needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

579
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,580
in the network to actually support such

00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,870
an operating mode

581
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:54,480
peer-to-peer traffic patterns i

00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:56,850
mentioned that<font color="#CCCCCC"> teredo is primarily</font>

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,820
leveraged by peer-to-peer applications

584
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,469
and because it's a platform capability

585
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,030
that we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use a lot more</font>

586
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:05,460
aggressively<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll start seeing more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

587
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:07,678
more applications relying on the

peer-to-peer platform that's deployed

589
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,270

further changes in traffic patterns

592
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:18,840
because it'll become a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

that leverage peer-to-peer traffic

patterns and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then finally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> botnets</font>

597
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:30,660
distributed denial of service and

598
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:32,970
ongoing area for us and we're always

599
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:35,220
looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways we can make it harder</font>

back onto the attackers wherever

605
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,330
possible so we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> made changes in the</font>

606
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:51,059
past in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that area for instance limiting</font>

looking for errors for improvements that

611
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,250
we can make over that algorithm to make

612
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:06,420
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> even harder to launch denial of</font>

613

service attacks so with all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that said</font>

614
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:12,300
what do I actually propose so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

615
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hard part because engagements in</font>

616
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:18,389
general are tricky to<font color="#E5E5E5"> meit's a design in</font>

617
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:20,850
a way that provides<font color="#E5E5E5"> value for both ends</font>

618
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:23,640
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> engagement and also our</font>

619
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:25,080
sustainable on an ongoing basis you

620
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,670
don't want something<font color="#CCCCCC"> too decoupled</font>

621
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,559
because then it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a trophies</font>

622
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:30,500
and you don't want something that's too

623
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,610
high<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost because you know then</font>

624
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:36,030
participating is high<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's no</font>

625
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:38,070
real benefit so what I what I'm sort of

626
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:40,980
proposing and what we've come up with so

627
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:44,879
far from our end is the notion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having</font>

628
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:48,540
open questions for now related to

to collect metrics around the behavior

of and posted both what the

infrastructure sees as well as what the

644
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:26,519
end hosts see we've had very limited

645
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:28,379
engagements with<font color="#E5E5E5"> operators in the past</font>

646
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:31,499
to start just in for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance in the</font>

647
00:28:28,379 --> 00:28:33,299
case of auto-tuning but I have a feeling

648
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:34,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it might be something that that</font>

649
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,908
that kind of engagement might be

650
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:39,418
something that's interesting to other

651
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:41,279
folks so we're open to that as well and

652
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:42,989
then just in general keeping keeping

653
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,629
tabs on you know where we're making

654
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:48,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">progress where their issues and having a</font>

656
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:55,559
can count on for bringing these sorts of

657
00:28:50,879 --> 00:28:58,918
concerns and that's all I had so I'm

658
00:28:55,559 --> 00:29:00,928
open to thoughts questions requests for

659
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:04,019
clarifications if you have feedback on

660
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:06,359
anything you've heard from<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that's an</font>

661
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:09,209
alias you can send it to tcp/ip feedback

662
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:12,269
and I'll take questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

663
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:15,899
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here other the other side</font>

664
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:19,139
oh sure over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm kind of curious</font>

665
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:22,228
about the performance improvement is

666
00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:24,418
that a windows to windows client to

667
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:26,149
server interaction do you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type</font>

668
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:29,429
of performance connecting to none

669
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:31,619
Microsoft servers for the auto tuning

670
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:33,629
the only change that you'll just have to

671
00:29:31,619 --> 00:29:35,879
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> running a Vista receiver any server</font>

672
00:29:33,629 --> 00:29:38,009
that understands<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows scaling will</font>

673
00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:41,458
give you you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that improvement and</font>

674
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:43,889
then offer a compound<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP you just have</font>

675
00:29:41,459 --> 00:29:47,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the sender because it's a</font>

676
00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:49,019
sender side change so in general we we

677
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:51,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really I mean when if obviously if</font>

678
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:54,160
you have a sender with compound<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP and</font>

679
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:56,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">a receiver with auto tuning then</font>

680
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,480
you'll get Marvin improvement than if

681
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:00,580
either side just as one of the

682
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,710
algorithms does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

683
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,540
question um it does thanks and I guess

684
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:07,510
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other general observation is</font>

685
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:10,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's TCP is one of those foundation</font>

686
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:13,780
things that you generally don't imagine

687
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:16,060
really getting modified all that much

688
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,070
without great review across a broad

689
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:20,560
spectrum of folks I mean everything

690
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,419
depends pretty much on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP stuff so</font>

691
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,570
I'm wondering is this is going to be

692
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:29,830
released with this new thing prior to

693
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:33,520
that broad discussion based interaction

694
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:36,730
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> so just to be clear the auto tuning</font>

695
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,100
algorithm actually is standard tcp it

696
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,500
doesn't make any changes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the TCP</font>

697
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:44,139
protocol all it's doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's changing</font>

698
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:47,530
the way that the receiver picks which

699
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:49,960
window it advertises which is well

700
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:52,750
within the scope of you know the rfcs

701
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,830
now the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the part that actually does</font>

702
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:58,330
change behavior is compound<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP and</font>

703
00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:00,280
compound<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP is not enabled by default</font>

704
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:02,800
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vista and that's part of the reason</font>

705
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">why it's not enabled by default it's</font>

706
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:08,940
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start engaging to</font>

707
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:13,690
understand its behavior better question

708
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:15,910
yes sir notice keenly that there's going

709
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:17,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be our plan to be support I'm not</font>

00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:20,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if he had said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was working or</font>

711
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:23,140
not for more or perhaps easier access to

00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:25,930
diff serve configs perhaps a socket

713
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:28,240
option when established can you could

714
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:31,450
you repeat the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite</font>

715
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,660
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet you were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying I heard there</font>

716
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:36,880
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> plans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support apparently for easier</font>

access for user applications to set

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:43,300
diffserv bits to to define things upon

719
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:45,310
binding to a socket well this is

720
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:48,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually where there's easier support</font>

00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:54,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">for administrators to configure diffserv</font>

00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:55,300
bits for applications sure is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

723
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,649
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can roll out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a policy</font>

724
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,840
saying you know the following

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,979

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not supposed to be something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

733
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,940
is our placement perhaps for queuing

734
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,559
control of stream or is it supposed to

735
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:22,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to push that congestion closer</font>

736
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:24,629
to client perhaps saying to a set of

737
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:27,450
machines that you're all behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dsl</font>

738
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:29,340
and you only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a half</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a make up my</font>

739
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:31,740
router can't sort so I'd like all the

740
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,929
machines to do so and pretend as if the

741
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:36,120
congestion is occurring perhaps within

742
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:37,980
the IP stack itself it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not happening</font>

743
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,689
someone meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> what well specifically</font>

744
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,030
this is for cases where you have an

745
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:44,850
admin in the picture someone who<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

746
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:46,800
actual control over the machines return

747
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:49,199
knowing can you know configure them so

748
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,750
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not for consumer environments for</font>

750
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:59,130
service to folks at home<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that answer</font>

751
00:32:54,390 --> 00:33:01,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">your question yep thank you so John</font>

752
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kristoff I have three questions if it's</font>

753
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:04,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to take you more than a med to</font>

754
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:07,050
answer Oh be happy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it offline</font>

755
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:09,330
the first is you'd mentioned something

756
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:12,059
about how if you get an authoritative

757
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:13,889
answer back you you'll then<font color="#E5E5E5"> said the</font>

758
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:15,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">cool send the quad a query and I just</font>

759
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:18,300
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to maybe clarify that because</font>

760
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,890
usually you're probably getting a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rear</font>

761
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,899
hitting a recursive server and so the

762
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:26,820
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was not actually authoritative</font>

763
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:29,820
per se the second question was regarding

764
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,530
the choice of firm reports that you use

765
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,720
and I know the UNIX is<font color="#CCCCCC"> have tended to</font>

766
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:36,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">use the range that you mentioned but why</font>

767
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,740
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use the entire you know 1024</font>

768
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:42,750
and everything above just as default<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

769
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,270
then lastly can you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything about</font>

770
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:48,510
sctp and implementation and maybe sort

771
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:50,490
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's things you you see that are</font>

772
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be who's using that what</font>

773
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,480
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that sort of</font>

774
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:56,879
thing okay first question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not quite</font>

775
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,820
sure I got it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but basically when we if</font>

776
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,980
we get it back an answer a specific

777
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,889
answer then we'll follow up with a quad

778
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,720
a query to that specific server that

779
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:08,270
make sense yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> you said authoritative</font>

780
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,590
answer I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clarify though</font>

781
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:15,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and then the second question was</font>

782
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:17,190
about the femoral men was the ephemeral

783
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:18,569
ports oh yeah a femoral port so now the

784
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:21,179
issue with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is that there are</font>

785
00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:24,089
actually a lot of registered parts that

786
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:28,560
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to avoid this has been a problem</font>

787
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:31,949
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past in this 10 20 40 to 49 k</font>

788
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,899
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1024</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5000 certainly there are</font>

789
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:38,009
parts that are registered<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people with</font>

790
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:41,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">ayanna which were which would originally</font>

791
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:44,550
conflict with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dynamic assignment</font>

792
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:46,439
logic but so these are you just are<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

793
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,819
was assuming maybe incorrectly these are

794
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,710
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> port you're choosing as a source</font>

795
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:52,230
port for an application are you talking

796
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:53,909
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes our sports so for instance if</font>

797
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:56,069
you are done if<font color="#CCCCCC"> your ephemeral part</font>

798
00:34:53,909 --> 00:35:00,359
assignment allows you to choose parts in

799
00:34:56,069 --> 00:35:02,700
the range 1024 to you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5000 what it</font>

800
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:05,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that an application may get in</font>

801
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,290
a source part which later someone else

802
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:10,170
will come along and<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and bind to</font>

803
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:12,240
because it's registered to them does

804
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:15,960
that make sense and then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> fail in do</font>

805
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:18,689
they are they're unhappy<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and then</font>

806
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last one was sctp oh yeah sctp so</font>

807
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:22,710
we've looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> sctp over the years</font>

808
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,609
currently we don't have any plans to

809
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:29,280
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> it some of the key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> features that</font>

810
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:31,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">sctp could potentially offer we've tried</font>

811
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> incorporate support for for instance</font>

812
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,930
better support for<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing</font>

813
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:39,629
connections we have api's that make it a

814
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:44,328
little easier for applications to do

815
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:47,880
that the biggest stopper for us has been

816
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:52,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the willingness and the investments in</font>

817
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,300
getting people moved over to complete in

818
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:56,099
your transfer protocol and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

819
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for you so in some ways it's</font>

820
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:02,730
like for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like tackling another</font>

821
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:06,630
ipv6 you know at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

822
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:08,130
we're tackling the ipv6 where I'm five

823
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:09,750
minutes but actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 five minutes</font>

824
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:11,250
behind schedule so let's just finish up

825
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">these questions we have out there and a</font>

826
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:19,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">little but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had mentioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that your</font>

827
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:22,669
diffserv<font color="#CCCCCC"> control point stuff is intended</font>

828
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:25,950
for an environment with an administrator

829
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:27,579
anything to prevent it or discourage it

830
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,950
or you know

831
00:36:27,579 --> 00:36:34,660
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used in by like by rogue</font>

832
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:38,709
applications in such environments or you

833
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:41,319
know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you know or rogue users you</font>

834
00:36:38,709 --> 00:36:44,078
administering their boxes to do bad

835
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:46,089
things with it well if if users have

836
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,249
adamant privileges on their machines

837
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:52,180
then note that nothing can prevent them

838
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:54,578
from abusing any packet marketing scheme

839
00:36:52,180 --> 00:37:00,129
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is no we haven't done</font>

840
00:36:54,579 --> 00:37:03,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything significant there yeah I have a</font>

841
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:05,349
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a toroidal and ipv6 so my</font>

842
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:09,190
understanding is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> teredo will not be</font>

843
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:11,709
turned on if ipv6 native is available so

844
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,509
it's more maybe a comment so coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

845
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:16,239
somebody with trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy this to</font>

846
00:37:13,509 --> 00:37:19,180
some more customers what happened when

847
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,759
we have a native v6 connection to one

848
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,249
customer another customer as a v4 not

849
00:37:21,759 --> 00:37:25,930
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> steroid oh my understanding also</font>

850
00:37:24,249 --> 00:37:29,379
is that today there is no such thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

852
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:35,799
clients to native<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 clients so what</font>

853
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:38,319
should happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok quick clarification so</font>

854
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:41,769
why is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you say teredo won't be</font>

855
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:44,759
used if you have I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it Tarata won't</font>

856
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:48,879
be preferred over a native ipv6 address

857
00:37:44,759 --> 00:37:51,699
if that's what you're saying but you can

858
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,130
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> both the native and a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 and deter</font>

859
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:55,809
a to address all at the same time so

860
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:58,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially my question is what happened</font>

861
00:37:55,809 --> 00:38:00,459
when two customers want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font>

862
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:03,219
peer-to-peer application based on night

863
00:38:00,459 --> 00:38:06,160
56 one of them has native ipv6 and via

864
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:08,229
the other one is only ipv4<font color="#CCCCCC"> nut and</font>

865
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,140
Ventura door so that leads me to my

866
00:38:08,229 --> 00:38:12,640
second question which is that or<font color="#CCCCCC"> or Adam</font>

867
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:17,890
a second comment which is that currently

868
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:21,038
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's no there are widely deployed to</font>

869
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:23,348
radio relays but there's nothing to

870
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:27,880
prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> people from deploying to radio</font>

871
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:30,640
relays and so in the environments where

872
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,000
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to rato aggressively we</font>

873
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,580
have some other

874
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">mcmechen mechanism other than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS to</font>

875
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,390
exchange addresses the pier name

876
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:41,420
resolution protocol is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example and</font>

877
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:43,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're out of box applications that</font>

878
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:47,120
leverage to raid 0 they use PRP to

879
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:49,640
exchange addresses and in general that's

880
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:52,130
sort of the model unless you if you have

881
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,440
native ipv6 connectivity and you need to

882
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:56,060
talk to someone that only has two rato

883
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:00,200
then either they're asking someone who's

884
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:01,759
willing to relay traffic for you or so

885
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,049
another way to ask my question I'm sorry

886
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,150
I need to cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> this off we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes</font>

887
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:07,460
behind schedule and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to get in and</font>

888
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,200
i'll be out there during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greek I get</font>

889
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about a lobby after Kurt's so</font>

890
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,799
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>
