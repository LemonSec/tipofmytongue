00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'd like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give credit to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Allison</font>

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,979
makin who actually did most of these

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides the rest of us were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of</font>

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,440
long for the ride it if the reference to

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,830
a reverse tree is a little too oblique

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:22,410
that that refers to DNA DARPA<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I PCR</font>

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:24,479
/ domains so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet2 has has</font>

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,019
arranged<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pilot implementation of</font>

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,939
DNS SEC and there's really not too much

10
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,830
involved at this point the participants

11
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,360
have just agreed to assign at least one

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,849
of their zones and it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be</font>

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,290
a production zone it can be a test zone

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,270
or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> not used on a daily basis</font>

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,910
and so the other thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

16
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,590
is exchanging keys with each other so

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,578
that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> mutually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> validate each</font>

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:53,489
other's data and we're also configuring

19
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:57,149
resolvers to make use of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys to</font>

20
00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:02,940
validate the data and we're also working

21
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:05,129
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cinque</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rural on this pilot so so</font>

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">far we just have three participants</font>

23
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,560
magpie has signed has been pretty

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,659
ambitious here they signed magpie<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nadine</font>

domains and in 15 reverse zones merit<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

27
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">recognizing an org and there's also RIT</font>

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,950
be that net has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> signed and one of</font>

our in a DARPA zones which we use for

30
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:33,270
nanog so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of URLs there</font>

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,600
where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can download</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our keys and</font>

32
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:39,600
configure them in your resolver nicer

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:45,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">net has has done domain under neither</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

35
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,600
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other participants who are</font>

36
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,960
actively developing DNS SEC deployments

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,059
on their campuses I believe UCLA is

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,610
actually going ahead and buying a number

39
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:08,848
of new servers specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> for DNS SEC</font>

40
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:11,640
deployment so internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> too we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

41
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,950
pretty run try be cutting edge and try

42
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,109
new things so

43
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:20,149
we're sort of suited to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font>

44
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:21,560
trial and we have a number of camp

45
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,810
mustiness groups that are participating

46
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:32,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">in our active and internet too so it</font>

47
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:34,280
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a natural environment so as I</font>

48
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:38,060
mentioned magpie has already done 15

49
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:41,239
reverse zones and<font color="#E5E5E5"> where Merritt has done</font>

50
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,010
one but while the reverse mappings

51
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:44,950
aren't really strong<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifiers zand</font>

52
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:47,209
you really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the Ford mappings</font>

53
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,730
there are a number of operators out here

54
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,739
which I think use reverse zones for for

55
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,048
naming interfaces and equipment so

56
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:57,290
there's there should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be interested in</font>

57
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:59,870
operators and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other issue we notice</font>

58
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:05,120
is it we have various domains under net

59
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:07,040
org edu and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's not clear</font>

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,829
when these top-level zones will actually

61
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,989
be signed but we all have domains under

62
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:18,620
in a dart bus so it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a</font>

63
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:21,170
natural<font color="#E5E5E5"> place to start so at the</font>

64
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,600
ripening last week I n actually stated

65
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,358
its intent to sign DARPA and<font color="#E5E5E5"> got in</font>

66
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,660
tones by the end of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year notice i</font>

67
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:32,359
said intent<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not real clear on how</font>

68
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:35,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">strong it is but ripe has already gone</font>

69
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:37,700
ahead with its<font color="#CCCCCC"> inner DARPA zone that it</font>

70
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:41,299
delegates and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it has a process for</font>

71
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:46,130
actually doing sign delegations so

72
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:47,480
they're pretty far along so but what

73
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,410
we're interested in is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

74
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,149
getting errand to do this as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

75
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,829
we've talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some folks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron and</font>

76
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,040
they say it's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their project list but</font>

77
00:03:54,829 --> 00:04:00,560
it's not a real high priority so they

78
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,540
they're looking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to actually make</font>

79
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,099
this a higher priority and to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up</font>

80
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:08,540
the priority chain so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

81
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,730
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools out there already and</font>

82
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,679
the standards seem to have kind of

83
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,649
stabilized at this point there were

84
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,470
recently a set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> three rfcs that kind</font>

85
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:21,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">of finalized the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS suck work it's been</font>

86
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,940
going on for about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years now so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

87
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,659
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this point people are pretty</font>

88
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:29,820
pretty happy with with

89
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:31,740
how it looks and so I this<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be a</font>

90
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">little optimistic but since I Anna is</font>

91
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,490
shooting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of the year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

92
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,650
hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron can do the same</font>

93
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:43,830
or at least move it up in terms of

94
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:46,130
priority that's it excellent thank you

95
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,130
