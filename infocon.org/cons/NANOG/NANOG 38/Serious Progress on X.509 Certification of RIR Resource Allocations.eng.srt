1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:06,410
afternoon my name is Jeff Houston I'm

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,880
from AP Nick this is a update on

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,759
resource certification and in particular

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,420
looking at the use cases around using

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,670
these kinds of resource certificates

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,470
come most of you come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Operations</font>

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,170
background and I'm sure you've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,180
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of email this is one that came from</font>

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,529
my deep and dark archives when I worked

10
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:31,948
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the telco in Australia when anyone</font>

11
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,140
ever calls you mate watch out because

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,700
they want something<font color="#CCCCCC"> from you and they</font>

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,309
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> it bad so when you see something</font>

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,790
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff maids then you're in deep</font>

15
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,769
trouble<font color="#E5E5E5"> and certainly this kind of mail</font>

16
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,510
message is not unfamiliar to most of you

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,410
where they complain about the front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

18
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,670
house they say they're getting

19
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,379
absolutely nowhere things<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to happen</font>

20
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,300
in seconds flat they tell you at the end

21
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,699
of the day and all you want to do is go

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,319
home and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the immediate</font>

23
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,910
reaction of servicing their demand

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,920
because after all you're trying to do

25
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,349
the right thing is that you get trouble

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,600
tickets and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of trouble ticket</font>

27
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,400
is probably one you've also seen where

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,960
as the result of doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right thing</font>

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,450
or so you thought for someone someone

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,179
else has<font color="#CCCCCC"> just been cut off because it</font>

31
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">really wasn't a clean route that you</font>

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,240
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> just put straight in that's</font>

33
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but you work for telco and telcos</font>

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,780
of course have legal department so all

35
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,419
of a sudden that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes the first thing</font>

36
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,950
next morning in your mailbox endless

37
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,780
phone calls are about to become your

38
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,210
life for the next week as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

39
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,159
resolve what you thought was quite an

40
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,559
innocent idea of trying to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,939
so you know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you've all been</font>

42
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,619
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've certainly lived that life</font>

43
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,189
once or twice as well and it's

44
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,799
unpleasant you know in looking back I

45
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,210
kind of think well gee whiz it would

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,700
have been nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have figured out who</font>

47
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,839
was lying there because if I could have

48
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,689
figured that out I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have got</font>

49
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,850
into this problem anyway and one way of

50
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing that is to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually say to someone</font>

51
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,919
well you know can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> demonstrate that</font>

52
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,439
it's your address really truly really

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,119
can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign something like a router</font>

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,758
origination request or something else

55
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,250
with a signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty tight</font>

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,220
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can then validate in other words</font>

57
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,490
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you give</font>

58
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,880
an authority as the prefix right of use

59
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:18,870
holder to me the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s and authority for</font>

60
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,000
me to originate this that I can validate

61
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,760
independently you know if only that was

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,650
around and you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of generalize this a</font>

63
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,929
little bit and sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

64
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,550
situation we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now and what</font>

65
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,090
kind of questions are flying<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

66
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,740
about routing security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as far as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

67
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,470
can see there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are sort of four very very</font>

68
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,740
basic questions that all of us worry

69
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:44,500
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some point is this someone</font>

70
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:47,770
lying is this a stolen prefixes is a

71
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:51,280
hijack prefix you know is this prefix

72
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:53,200
really in play is it valid and if I'm

73
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at someone's else's route being</font>

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,000
sent to me being advertised to me who

75
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,030
the hell actually advertise that address

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,280
prefix into the network anyway and the

77
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:05,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">really tough question did they have the</font>

78
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,130
credentials do they have the authority

79
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,510
did they have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

80
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:12,040
cleanly in other words are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

81
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,250
credentials there to advertise this

82
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,160
address prefix and it's more than just

83
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,769
origination is someone lying in the

84
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,959
gayest path route AAS path that's being

85
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:26,470
is presented to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me is that path</font>

86
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,320
authentic those are very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> tough</font>

87
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,510
questions and what would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really good</font>

88
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,799
is if we could answer them because quite

89
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:38,350
frankly today you can't all these kinds

90
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,049
of route registries and so on do not

91
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,600
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you authoritative answers that give</font>

92
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:45,010
you best efforts what would be good is

93
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,170
to actually inject a little bit of

94
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,600
security into this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to use</font>

95
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,089
reliable infrastructure to validate

96
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,459
these assertions so that when I see

97
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">someone saying please Jeff route this</font>

98
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:58,420
when I'm looking at the routing table

99
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,840
and saying is that address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm</font>

100
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:03,488
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> really truly really right then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

101
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,260
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to authenticate that that</font>

102
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,060
assertion in terms of routing was

103
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,090
actually made by the person who<font color="#E5E5E5"> has that</font>

104
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,310
address to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> confirm that that</font>

105
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,820
information is correct complete

106
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:17,858
unaltered and to actually convey routing

107
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,190
authorities so that the person who has

108
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,798
<font color="#CCCCCC">the address</font>

109
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:25,040
can indeed create assertions that can be

110
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:28,280
checked validated and aren't forged or

111
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:32,420
altered so you know it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really</font>

112
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:35,210
good is to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all three of that magic</font>

113
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,980
trio good fast and cheap you actually

114
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:39,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a reliable and efficient and</font>

115
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,650
effective way<font color="#E5E5E5"> of underpinning the</font>

116
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,140
Internet's address resource distribution

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,820
structure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use you go I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear well</font>

118
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,260
routing in the open on the internet you

119
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,750
know best effort we've survived so far

120
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:54,110
what's the problem it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

121
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:56,180
more than routing I'm like most of you I

122
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:59,240
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when here looking at v6 this</font>

123
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:02,660
afternoon yes and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run out</font>

124
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,450
of unallocated address pools feeding the

are you going to get addresses from how

<font color="#E5E5E5">are you going to figure out that the</font>

133
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,340
does have those addresses and how are

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,500
you going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out that once you've</font>

135
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,599
done this kind of transfer or trade or

whatever you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it that you</font>

properties of which right of use in

clean title appear to be fundamental so

145
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,659
we certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to replace what we</font>

173
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,940
of the early pieces of work is to add

00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:08,219
into that support for this resource

extension<font color="#CCCCCC"> describing IP addresses in</font>

176
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,250
certificates and a huge amount of work

177
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:15,719
on designing a certification framework

178
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,389
so you end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a certificate which</font>

179
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,130
is subtly different from traditional

00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:22,199
x.509 certificates it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,360
even my role is you know this particular

183
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,859
role so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a role or an identity</font>

184
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,260
certificate it's something subtly

185
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,570
different it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rite of use certificate</font>

186
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:37,080
the issuer is certifying that the

00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:45,750

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,229
occasionally in some areas and although

the bottom of various forms of service

207
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,929
providers and users who actually are the

208
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,280
recipients of those allocations so does

209
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,099
note some of those chains may be

210
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,780
indirect not everyone is tightly tied to

211
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,960
a particular

212
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,240
I are so what would the certificate do

213
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,240
it would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply mirror and match</font>

214
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,370
the allocation actions so that if Li are

215
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,200
one has a certificate it would just

216
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,920
simply say what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Holdings they have from</font>

00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">Erin so here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is one Erin would issue a</font>

221
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,950
key information is the public key of the

key of Aaron if you go down one step

224
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,110
further that lir might themselves issue

225
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,450
a certificate saying I<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave a / 24 to</font>

226
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,250
that is P exactly the same type of

227
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,710
certificate but now the issuer is the

228
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,290
lar the subject is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ISP and it's a</font>

229
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:21,830
more specific that's actually been

230
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:23,689
certified in that allocation action the

231
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,000
RSP itself might issue a self-signed

232
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,770
certificate it's an end entity

233
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,100
certificate and it describes some

234
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:33,230
resources it's actually signed with the

235
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:37,630
new public key and signed with its old

236
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:40,430
private key why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do this well</font>

237
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:44,420
maybe what you'd like to do is to say

238
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:48,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">something quite definitive that me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is P</font>

241
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,329
/ 24 in other words here's an authority

65,000 originating that previous the

prefix owner actually said that's a good

245
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,959
thing to happen so how do you make that

246
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,270
a bit more robust you might attach onto

247

that route origination<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual copy</font>

of the certificate the end entity

249
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,740
certificate you used and you would sign

250
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:22,339
it with its private key well and good

251
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:24,380
how would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use that if you send it to</font>

252
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:27,130
me if I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the routing system if</font>

253
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,420
I see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that somewhere can i validate that</font>

254
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:32,240
so the first thing I try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

255
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,610
figure out did the matching private key

of that Indian<font color="#E5E5E5"> dirty certificate sign</font>

259
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,529
is that certificate actually valid do

260
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,660
the dates match is it cryptographically

261
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,689
correct do all the fields actually

00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:56,770
conform to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a resource certificate is the</font>

264
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:03,520
there's the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is it truly valid</font>

can I<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a trust anchor of my choosing</font>

266
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,069
as I'm the relying party here can I find

00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,900
do with these kinds of resource

291
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,819
certificates if you are allocating I

292
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,980
addresses further down the food chain

293
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,990
you can issues subordinate certificates

294
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,220
so that when you allocate you would

295
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,620
issue a certificate to match that

296
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,150
allocation and if we certificate you

297
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,709
issue you would store in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> local</font>

298
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,750
repository so you'd maintain a

299
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:25,989
certificate collection that matches what

300
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,390
you've allocated you can sign things and

301
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,190
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important because what</font>

302
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're really saying is I'm doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

303
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,560
with the authority of that prefix all

304
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:37,689
that a s number so that now I can

305
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually attach some authority to some</font>

306
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,589
of these objects that are floating

307
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:44,410
around by effectively showing my

308
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:46,120
certificate my validity path and signing

309
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:49,020
it with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> private key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that says it</font>

310
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,020
really was me

311
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,790
and of course you can validate things

312
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,730
other people can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this and say is</font>

313
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,949
this real did it happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> do as a resource</font>

314
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,720
holder really have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing did they</font>

315
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">really do it or are they lying their</font>

316
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:07,140
head off is this a hijack<font color="#E5E5E5"> or is it real</font>

317
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:09,810
is it valid today do I have the

318
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,520
permission here are now those are much

319
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,530
stronger statements that you're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

320
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,439
make if you can validate something<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

321
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:19,980
yet otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

322
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,440
it look like even actually look a little

323
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,880
bit like DNS SEC I suspect although it

324
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,460
doesn't have quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the features</font>

325
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,370
or failings of DNS SEC which I regard as

326
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,770
a good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and here is a subtly</font>

327
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,320
altered object that you might see as the

328
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,730
result of a who is query it's got the

329

signature over not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only the external</font>

336
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:56,330
part but also the URL that says this

certificate this<font color="#E5E5E5"> object has been signed</font>

338
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,690
and if you looked up the matching

339
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:04,590
certificate note those members there the

340

160 and 203 the matching certificate

342
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:14,970
which you can validate contains those

343
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:17,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">same sets of resources so that now you</font>

can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the resource right</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">run full-blown certificate authorities</font>

not everyone wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight their way</font>

353
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,640
through some of the intricacies of

00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,780
managing certificates in<font color="#CCCCCC"> x509 indeed if</font>

355
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,590
you look on the literature and do a

356
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:49,740
basic Google search pk-pk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I as a dead is</font>

357
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:53,430

358
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:56,340
natural and certainly strong security is

359
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,319
not often<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheap how can we make this</font>

360
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,260
easier how can we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the good</font>

fast and cheap out of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> ma</font>

362
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,740
certainly as part of this trial we're

363
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,140
looking at can we do this via portal

364
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,240
based mechanisms and actually allow you

365
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,740
to outsource a huge amount of the

366
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,020
certification work that you would

367
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">otherwise need to do how can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

368
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,460
portals that<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply generate and sign</font>

369
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,500
objects how can we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> use such</font>

370
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,540
portals if you're willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to trust them</font>

373
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,990

374
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,400
don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trust someone else and</font>

375
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,290
maybe that's a very good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe</font>

376
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,230
it's your business<font color="#E5E5E5"> in not trusting other</font>

377
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,790
people fair enough what local tools can

378
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,910
we put out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would allow you to do</font>

we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fair way certainly the</font>

generating test certificate repositories

401
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:26,670
been done by the folk at the right NCC

that perform validation of these

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,900
like to complete most of this trial by

trying to understand what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

true production actually allowing folk

421
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,250
in that area to be able to have use

422
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:15,110
certificates to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to sign</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

423
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,970
and be able to validate those results

424
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:19,339
and certainly there are some questions

425
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,500
there about is this approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

426
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:23,629
going to meet its objectives what are

427
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,750
the implications in a broad policy sense

428
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:29,600
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how does it mean to us as a</font>

429
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,760
registry and you as ISPs and service

430
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,350
providers in terms of your operating

431
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,480
procedures your operating support

432
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:39,310
systems and similar what are the policy

433
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,390
considerations and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this point</font>

434
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:43,580
once I acknowledge the folk who have

435
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:47,360
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on this from a panic judge</font>

436
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,980
Robin myself Randy and Rob from your

437
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,439
region of the world with<font color="#E5E5E5"> support from</font>

our and i believe and<font color="#E5E5E5"> steve kent and</font>

440
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,040
and Rob Kissel a key from the ripe NCC

441
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,300
I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to Randy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bush who</font>

442
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,409
will tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about the</font>

443
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,409
implementation side of this

444
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,340
did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup three foils as usual when</font>

445
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped as usual when letting Jeff</font>

446
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,899
talk first he covers just about

447
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:22,540
everything i want to say pretty quick

448
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:24,190
that currently I feel have noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

449
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,379
the real work is being done by

450
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:30,910
conspiracy<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Rob's one from each region</font>

451
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:36,160
and so we're robbing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Peter and the only</font>

452
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:41,799
poll we've got is from AP netqin so all

453
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:46,000
the money's going there so the extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> 37</font>

454
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:51,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">79 specifies extension to x 5 i'll</font>

455
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,760
insert to describe IP address ranges and

456
00:18:51,480 --> 00:19:00,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">AAS numbers in other words let's search</font>

457
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:04,390
say this set of resources are assigned

458
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:09,130
object<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's an extension</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

459
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:12,130
openssl that work is essentially done by

460
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,240
robb maus team you sitting over here we

461
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,490
only have room one of the Rob's

462
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,929
representing all three but<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually he's</font>

463
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:21,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">been doing all of the heavy lifting um</font>

464
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:24,190
and that's currently turned back into

465
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:27,610
the openssl folk to be merged oh it's

466
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:29,650
open source um those of you who<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

467
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,909
with openssl<font color="#E5E5E5"> and use it at all notice</font>

468
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,250
they've been in a release every

469
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:35,980
fortnight mode for about two months now

470
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:39,370
is vulnerability is appear so it's not

471
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:41,230
yet visible publicly maybeee the end of

472
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:45,309
november we don't know then it's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

473
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:47,950
their development cycle cope management

474
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,928
what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really and we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going through</font>

475
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,340
four layers here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would think of them</font>

476
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:53,640
going up but here they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

477
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:57,490
down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're used to inverted trees um</font>

478
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,080
the second layer is look uunet or

479
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:02,590
whatever you're called this month<font color="#E5E5E5"> chris</font>

480
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,320
and and sprint and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth</font>

481
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,980
are big they're going to have their own

482
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,010
repositories they're going to have their

483
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:11,740
own piece of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki structure that if</font>

484
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,770
the certificates<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave issue and it's</font>

485
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,110
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be scattered just like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

486
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:18,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">irr</font>

488
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:24,130
really have only about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 copy 30</font>

489
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:27,379
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ri-ight are our repositories</font>

490
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:30,530
there has to be a tool set to pull this

491
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,500
stuff local to you so that you have a

492
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:35,000
validated set and as it pulls it it

493
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,070
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be following pointers that</font>

494
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,440
could be you know leading into outer

495
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:43,700
space<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would trap you know denial of</font>

496
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:47,240
service etc etc so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is a validated</font>

497
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:50,270
fetch and since it's based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

498
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,860
like arsenic<font color="#CCCCCC"> rsync and it's very</font>

499
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,290
suspicious we're calling it for the

500
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:58,370
moment arsenic because dinicol about

501
00:20:54,290 --> 00:21:03,350
what it gets and that is in current um

502
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:07,370
test and is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also done and it's being in</font>

503
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:10,040
final<font color="#CCCCCC"> debugging testing and if it were</font>

504
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:12,139
useful that somebody wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play with</font>

505
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">it it'll be out there but you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't do a</font>

506
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:19,549
lot useful with it because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't</font>

507
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:21,580
got the structure to you know with certs

508
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:26,450
this just gathers all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> circuit what</font>

509
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:28,909
happened is is George<font color="#CCCCCC"> Michaelson from AP</font>

510
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:32,500
nick has essentially generated the

511
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:35,660
certificate structure that might be a

512
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:39,830
representative<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a half or something of</font>

513
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:41,809
the total number of certificates that

514
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:44,270
would represent all resources today and

515
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:46,370
on a machine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got for instance</font>

516
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's loaded with about five other</font>

517
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,780
large net applications it takes less

518
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,900
than a minute to sort that from all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

519
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:58,190
distributive theme so bki is not

520
00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:00,470
expensive ok the next layer is what

521
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,809
we're in the middle of its designing

522
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:05,960
which is the tools for certificate

523
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:11,000
management in other words when I as an

524
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,580
end site go to my ISP and say give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a</font>

525
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,220
certificate for<font color="#CCCCCC"> my space and that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> P</font>

526
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,918
goes up a level etc so it's kind of a

527
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:21,530
parent-child relationship and what are

528
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:23,720
the transactions and those transactions

529
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:25,820
are currently envisioned to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a small</font>

530
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">message passing system with only about a</font>

531
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:32,600
half a dozen primitives and with very

532
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:36,680
simple XML wrappers okay then the last

533
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:38,389
is operational service profile the web

534
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:42,050
interfaces that different people will

535
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:50,690
have etc but note that if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have these</font>

536
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:53,480
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> formally 25 and interoperable the</font>

537
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,910
entities<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everybody is interoperable</font>

538
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,390
for once you will be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

539
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:02,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">something in the right region and in the</font>

540
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:05,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron region and it will interoperate</font>

541
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,040
luckily<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're all sitting down because</font>

542
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is an exceeding shocking thing if</font>

543
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:13,370
you've been around very long<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

544
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:17,899
ripe and as and as Jeff is pointed out

545
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:19,669
right ap Nick and Aaron have been coke

546
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,380
inspiring at a very low level just

547
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,380
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> working engineers instead of</font>

548
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:28,250
large meetings and task force forces to

549
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:30,530
achieve this and and it is done with

550
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,360
consent of consenting adults from each

551
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:35,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too but in the meantime we're having</font>

552
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,459
a grand time and the other two

553
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:41,240
registries are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> cognizant of this</font>

554
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:45,470
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> AfriNIC and blackmail and so</font>

555
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:48,290
essentially as jeff says you're looking

556
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:52,750
at you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year you're going to be</font>

557
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,750
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play with this useful and</font>

558
00:23:53,230 --> 00:24:02,679
this removes one of the two big

559
00:23:57,309 --> 00:24:06,270
obstacles for your router's being able

560
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:10,660
to formally cryptographically validate

561
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:12,760
proudly but the routing vendors are

562
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:17,410
going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this probably after I've</font>

563
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:19,179
retired um unless we're all in the Wall

564
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:22,600
Street Journal some Wednesday afternoon

565
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:25,780
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year which probably will happen</font>

566
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:28,740
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I retire but it</font>

567
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:31,750
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the meantime</font>

568
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:34,120
the first thing is is Jeff pointed out

569
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,669
well when a customer comes to you and

570
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,939
his first foil and says hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix it up</font>

571
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:45,640
quickly could<font color="#CCCCCC"> you please route 192 192</font>

572
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:47,380
192 / 24 for me you can say show me that

573
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,299
you actually have the right to ask me

574
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,020
that question in a formal

575
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:55,450
cryptographically variable fiable sense

576
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:57,400

something and who is today you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:07,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">next step is those of us who tend to</font>

580
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:13,090
build routing filter lists for our

<font color="#E5E5E5">to validate those data as we're fetching</font>

583
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:21,820
them against certificates in two ways

584
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,350
number one is you can just say who's

585
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,389
saying they have this and look up the

586
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,370
certificate but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other is as Jeff</font>

587
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:31,750
pointed out in one of his foils those

our<font color="#CCCCCC"> IR our data can be signed with these</font>

589
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:40,480
certificates in other words when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

590
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:43,360
in the IRR near is prefixed 147 2800 you

591
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:49,710
can sign that with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a certificate that</font>

592
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:52,209
represents the resource 147 2800<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

593
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:55,510
then that stuff you can incrementally

594
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:59,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">add your operational structure that will</font>

595
00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:04,000
give you significant benefit today

596
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:04,000
in questions

597
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:22,710
um how long do you issue is your tip I'm

with certificates which issues you're

talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a matter of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> policy I</font>

607
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:49,649
wouldn't issue a certificate no matter

608
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,480
how much you paid me you can come to the

609

<font color="#E5E5E5">errand meaning for the rest of this week</font>

610
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:58,139
and discuss how that policy might be in

611
00:26:54,210 --> 00:27:00,359
the iron region the guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

612
00:26:58,139 --> 00:27:03,779
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way binding on the</font>

613
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:06,840
registries is that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will issue a</font>

614
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:11,100
certificate whose lifetime is that of

your contract<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them your contracts</font>

616
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,149
with at least the two registries of

00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,799
which I play seriously by the way Jeff

618
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:21,889
accuse me have been from this region I'm

619
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,889
really work for a Japanese<font color="#CCCCCC"> company is</font>

620
00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:28,498
one year this means that the length of

621
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:31,439
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> crl is actually not likely to be</font>

622
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:32,940
very bad which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think was the</font>

623
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,590
underlying question towards what you

624
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,909
were heading yes I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering if you</font>

625
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,738
were planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> use you know some</font>

626
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:39,779
automated tools for getting the serial

627
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:41,549
distributed when I do the verification

628
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:44,249
during the verification<font color="#CCCCCC"> crls check</font>

629
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:45,960
period no question it has to be if I

630
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:47,369
could if I could add the the tool that

631
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,509
we're using is all based around a

632
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:50,730
certificate structure where the

633
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:52,440
certificates you issue and the

634
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:54,119
certificate revocation list that you

635
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,399
manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> are distributed within the same</font>

636
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:59,340
mechanism if you wish to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the local</font>

637
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,879
case you'll just suck up the lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

638
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,879
thank you

639
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:09,520
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually escaping it wasn't</font>

640
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:12,340
asking the question next what's up

641
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,520
everybody wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rock and roll I'm</font>

642
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:17,669
stuck here<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the rest of the week so</font>
