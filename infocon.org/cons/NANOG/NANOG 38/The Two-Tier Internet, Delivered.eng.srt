91
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:30,120
situation well we took advantage of an

eight-year-old RFC which has finally

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,720
finally works adequately well so we feel

113

again as I mentioned we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have two</font>

114

tiers you actually have five tiers and

115
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,560
so what do we do this year we define

116
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:29,159
some simple classes real-time

117
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,509
interactive good and best effort we also

118
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:32,610
matched for the real time of course

119
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:34,949

120
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,539

<font color="#E5E5E5">through but can go behind real-time</font>

122
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:42,900
interactive we have AF 31 and cs3 for

123
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,860
best effort we match anything that's

124
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,719
dscp tag but not set<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a class selector</font>

125
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,629
in the policy map we bind these classes

126
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,009
together and as you can see call<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 5 3 &</font>

the policy map at the top a nice thing

132
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,190
in general unrelated the policy map is

133
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,520

you fix that on the router we have a

firewall config by Vincent and we are

155
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:51,690
matching some other things to various

00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:53,400

class which actually maps to the good

158
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,429
cost map and that is matching tcp syn

getting in their various accolades is

that ssh is working nicely which is what

174
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,919
the predominant telltale

175
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,830
of good network to us seems to be the

176
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,128
top trace route is ICMP responses from

177

UDP probes from post yonder towards a

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,400

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually working so looking at the APS</font>

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,948
we can see what's actually being matched

we can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>
