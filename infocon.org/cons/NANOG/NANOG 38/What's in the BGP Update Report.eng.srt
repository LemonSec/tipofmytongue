00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,250
thanks Todd this is actually a very

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:09,030
quick talk about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP update report</font>

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,780
why is there a BGP update report not

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:15,690
everyone is noisy in BGP not everyone

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,669
generates huge numbers of BGP updates in

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,970
fact very few of you are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> naughty</font>

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:24,390
but those very few of you are extremely

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,919
naughty so in the grand tradition of the

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">saito report the only thing I can really</font>

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,019
do is name and chain who are these folk

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,129
and why are they doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this down the</font>

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">bottom there you actually see a</font>

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,820
cumulative distribution of a esas versus

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,960

17
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:53,160
saw in the last two weeks so a very

18
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:55,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number of you are evil so in order</font>

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,300
to actually name it and for all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,210
the rest of you to know who they are

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,218
every week I send out a BGP update

22
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,530
report to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nano</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Manning list it's</font>

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,850
over in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Asia Pacific so if you look</font>

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,430
yourself you might find subtly different

26
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,890
numbers but DGP is a global<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing when I</font>

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,780
see noise you probably see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so</font>

28
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,360
rolling<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-week reports so i take the</font>

29
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,520
last 14 days and analyze it and I post

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,820
it to the now list friday every friday

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,470
at 1200 UTC it's also online you'll see

32
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,029
later where it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the header</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,820
mailer is that that tells you what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

34
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,400
period is I analyzed the<font color="#CCCCCC"> report is in</font>

35
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,860
three parts<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first part of the most</font>

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,700
unstable assi saw in the last two weeks

37
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">named and their relative volumes so on</font>

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,229
friday the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixth of October over the</font>

39
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,048
last two weeks the PTT in Indonesia

40
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:49,679
grabbed the top spot it was responsible

41
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,439
for 34,000 updates or three-point-two

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,250
percent of the total update load that I

43
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,798
saw amazing that was 91 updates per

44
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,229
prefix someone in the Caucasus was also

45
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,759
having fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> number two and against</font>

46
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,070
someone in Indonesia they must be making

47
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,280
sport of this was number three if you

48
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,709
see yourself named there you should

49
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,110
wonder why the hell I'm seeing you

50
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:19,990
generate so much noise

51
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:22,330
see a net is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 702 thank you the relative</font>

52
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,650
/ prefix instability of course when you

53
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,210
do an update you update all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

54
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,950
prefixes but some people only<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

55
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,930
very small number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of prefixes but still</font>

56
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,850
do an amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> updates these</font>

57
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,100
are points for outstanding effort and

58
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,500
last week's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where a prize goes to multi</font>

61
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,769
they can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep their announcements</font>

62
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">table so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is divided by the number</font>

63
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,400
of prefixes being announced and again

64
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,399
you see the top 50 I've just reproduced

65
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,520
the top 12 here if you're on this why

66
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,290
and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also interested in</font>

67
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,510
prefixes so the third part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the report</font>

68
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,549
you see in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mailer is indeed the top</font>

69
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:00,220
prefixes and this week's or last week's

70
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:04,570
prize went to India where one single

71
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:06,970
prefix generated 3185 updates I've

72
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,200
certainly seen many presentations that

73
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,380
say would even though there are a lot of

74

get packets through consistently and

77
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,380
again if you see your net there d dnas

80
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,208
the hell your network is phenomenally

81
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:33,670
unstable there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page to do this</font>

82
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:35,140
this web page is updated every single

83
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,059
day so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see your progress</font>

84
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,029
in terms of trying to be number one on

85
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,560
the updates go there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

86
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,660
there are a number of grafts this is the

87
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,450
peak per second update load that my

88
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,340
router got on a logarithmic scale

89
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,988
updates are very very noisy<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

90
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,570
about a single order of magnitude in

91
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:55,930
peak rates between 100 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,000 updates</font>

92
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:57,040
per second so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the peak per second</font>

93
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,220
right there are a few other things on

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,780
the page if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really want to</font>

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,130
things you can drill down that page is
