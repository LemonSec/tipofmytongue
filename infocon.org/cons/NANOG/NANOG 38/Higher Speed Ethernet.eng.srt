00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:05,220
hi my name is Peter<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shawn maker I'm</font>

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,798
going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> higher-speed</font>

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:14,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">study group that was started in the I</font>

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:17,869
Triple E group basically the I Triple E

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,220
formed a new study group to look at

6
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:23,100
developing a standard for Ethernet

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:28,259
that's uses a speed greater than 10

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:30,359
gigabits per second in<font color="#E5E5E5"> July</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of 2006 of</font>

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,600
this year in San Diego there was a call

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,780
for interest which is a presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">a request to the I Triple E 8023 group</font>

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,840
to decide if that people want to pursue

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,349
looking at developing the standard for a

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,860
higher speed<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet the study group</font>

15
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:53,399
was perform was approved it required a

16
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">50-percent boat and basically we they</font>

17
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,000
had 54 or fifty three yes votes three no

18
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,210
votes and three abstains so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,320
overwhelming interest in forming<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,729
study group to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at new speeds</font>

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,820
each study group actually has a

22
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">six-month lifetime so there's some time</font>

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,149
schedules and deadlines that they

24
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,770
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meet in order to make</font>

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">it out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the study group otherwise it</font>

26
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:23,220
expires and the new call for interest

27
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,158
must be introduced to look at look at

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same topic you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can get a six-month</font>

29
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">extension to extend that beyond the</font>

30
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,470
original six months so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

31
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">finish the work and get out of the study</font>

32
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:39,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">group in September we had there was the</font>

33
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:43,520
first actual hsg working group for study

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:47,009
group meeting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Knoxville Tennessee and</font>

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one is November there's a 802</font>

36
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:55,049
plenary in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dallas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Texas where they'll</font>

37
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:57,420
meet again so they the study group is

38
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:02,070
basically just looking at the criteria

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,180
or the desire<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build the standard so</font>

40
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,860
there's a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

41
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do to actually get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the study</font>

42
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">group and the first thing they have to</font>

43
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">do is design the objectives so the</font>

44
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,930
objectives are just the design criteria

45
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,930
for the new standard what they

46
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,200
it to do how they<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to work any</font>

47
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:23,519
constraints basically on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the design</font>

48
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:25,200
after that they the hsg study group is

49
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,030
actually different in the past because

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,689
old study groups always<font color="#E5E5E5"> came out with</font>

51
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,219
only one what's called par and five

52
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:34,469
criterias basically they were only going

53
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:37,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to develop one standard but because of</font>

54
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:39,420
looking at the the breadth of previous

55
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,069
study groups and the number of standards

56
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,679
that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> came out of the 10 gigabit</font>

57
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:47,129
there may be a potential for having

58
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,889
multiple tasks force or standards

59
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:52,798
working groups come out of this study

60
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:55,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">group so once the objectives are</font>

61
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:57,870
actually defined they will about the

62
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:59,399
study group will evaluate the objectives

63
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,049
and the number of projects within those

64
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,900
objectives and then they have to

65
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:06,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">generate what's called the project</font>

66
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,000
authorization request so the project

67
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,079
authorization request is just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> summary</font>

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,549
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work what they plan on doing</font>

69
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:17,069
scope that sort of thing and then

70
00:03:14,549 --> 00:03:21,260
there's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> the five criteria which</font>

71
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:26,728
defines the feasibility or the

72
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:28,679
popularity of the actual standard so you

73
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:30,510
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the 10 Gigabit</font>

74
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,930
Ethernet study group which is a really

75
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:36,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">good example for looking at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font>

76
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:40,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what we what they've done for that</font>

77
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:42,298
I've listed the URL and the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

78
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:47,849
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 gigabit per second</font>

79
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:49,470
ethernet tutorial so they have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

80
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:51,689
critters here and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

81
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,569
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the five criteria that must be</font>

82
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:58,799
met in order for the study group<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

83
00:03:54,569 --> 00:04:00,540
accepted so the 8023 working group

84
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,310
actually votes on two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> par</font>

85
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,620
that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier and</font>

86
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,549
the five criteria to decide if a task

87
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:12,000
force should be formed to actually the

88
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:14,069
to actually define the standard so the

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,959
first criteria is broad market potential

90
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,039
we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to define and</font>

91
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,019
determine<font color="#CCCCCC"> how many people are actually</font>

92
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:21,209
going to buy this product how many ports

93
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,340
work they're going to buy and this is

94
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,779
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problems that</font>

95
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,669
they're one of the problems are facing

96
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:28,290
in the hsg working group

97
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,630
which really affects<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

98
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:34,880
operators because a lot of the people

99
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:37,140
are looking at the very high volumes of

100
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,480
ports and when they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a</font>

101
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,219
better grasp on actually how many people

102
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,340
will actually buy a port speed that's

103
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,540
higher than 10 gigabits per second we

104
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,369
know there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

105
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,110
that really need it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the question is</font>

106
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,800
is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need it and how many</font>

107
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:56,850
ports they really need also because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

108
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,100
working group is in the 8023<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet</font>

109
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,650
group the compatibility so it has to

110
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:05,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually be compatible with the previous</font>

111
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:07,710
standards and then also has to have a

112
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,110
distinct identity so the distinct

113
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,130
identity is basically means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it has</font>

114
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,800
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> different from every other</font>

115
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,810
standard and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher speed Ethernet</font>

116
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,040
is pretty easy to meet that criteria

117
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:23,790
just because it's faster so it gives it

118
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,620
a distinct identity and then technical

119
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,170
feasibility can we actually build the

120
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,550
standard build product deliver product

121
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,180
that's based off the standard that's

122
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:36,080
defined and then they have the the

123
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:42,200
parakeet which is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheep cheep cheep so</font>

124
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,200
for economic feasibility that's really

125
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,710
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be it has to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

126
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,240
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be able to afford this</font>

127
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,090
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have to make it at the</font>

128
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,490
price that that meets the marketplace so

129
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:57,390
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the five criteria and the</font>

130
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,400
compatibility indistinct<font color="#CCCCCC"> identity are</font>

131
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,740
relatively easy it's the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

132
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:08,310
that are really the more difficult bar

133
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:10,110
to meet so to build the par and the the

134
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,210
five criteria you refers to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the</font>

135
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:15,510
objectives so the objectives are just

136
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:17,549
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the constraints</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the design so</font>

137
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,310
I'd put up some examples of the 10

138
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,320
gigabit per second constraints and you

139
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:26,510
know one of them is the the goal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

140
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:29,159
preserve the 8023 ethernet frame format

141
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,539
support full duplex operations only

142
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,280
because the study group decided that you

143
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,890
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need half duplex in this day and</font>

144
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,929
age and then they also defined two

wind

147
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,990
there's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 or 15 other</font>

148
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,669
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can see in the tutorial</font>

149
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,320
but those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of examples of</font>

150
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:49,160
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher speed study group will</font>

151
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,750
define so there's in the first meeting

152
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a lot of discussion kind of</font>

153
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:58,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the direction and kind of how they</font>

154
00:06:53,060 --> 00:07:00,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to attack the actual standard so</font>

155
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,920
the one of the main debates is that

156
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,200
speed for a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people I think it's a</font>

157
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,030
they assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be 10</font>

158
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,740
gigabits per second but there's a lot of

159
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:14,479
debate about actually what the true

160
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:16,190
speed is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be because people are</font>

161
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,870
looking at multi-lane approaches so

162
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,400
they're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how many lanes so</font>

163
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,070
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have four lanes by twenty</font>

164
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,289
five or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten lanes by ten some people are</font>

165
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:27,500
looking at serial so it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be a</font>

166
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:29,360
fixed rate and other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are also</font>

167
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,980
looking at the scalable speed so it

168
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,570
might actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to go from 20</font>

169
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:37,340
gigs to 200 gigs or higher and people

170
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,560
basically proposed anywhere from

171
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,010
scalable speeds to 80 gigabits per

172
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:47,060
second hundred gigabits per second 120

173
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:50,000
even faster traditionally the tradition

174
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:54,200
is in 8023 is to go 10x the<font color="#E5E5E5"> speed so</font>

175
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,240
we've gone 10 100 1 gig 10 gig but

176
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,250
there's some concern that we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

177
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to go that that big a jump and</font>

178
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:03,410
follow the tradition in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 223 group</font>

179
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,750
that you get 10x to speed for three

180
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:08,330
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost the optics are pretty</font>

181
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:13,190
pretty scary<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the 10 gigabit per</font>

182
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:14,359
second rates or the or even 80 gigs then

183
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,740
also some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have talked about</font>

184
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,900
proposing the SONET SDH compatible

185
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,860
speeds just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that it's there's a</font>

186
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,299
belief that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there might be a better</font>

187
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:29,590
compatibility with existing DWDM and

188
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:33,770
infrastructure layer one infrastructure

189
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:35,329
well the other big debate there's two

190
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,000
more in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> distance is the second big</font>

191
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:39,710
one and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people are</font>

192
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,510
really worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how long does this</font>

193
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:44,030
actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go where's the market</font>

194
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:46,700
potential how far our most of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> port's</font>

195
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,839
going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be used different</font>

196
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,540
speeds have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been talked about for</font>

197
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,910
different marketplaces too so there's

198
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,579
talk about the less than 10 meters and

199
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:59,779
the less than 10 meters is basically for

200
00:08:55,579 --> 00:09:03,439
backplane uses within a router of

201
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:06,800
chassis 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> meter is short distances and</font>

202
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,899
300 meters is kind of data centers 2

203
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,000
meter is can be data center<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then it</font>

204
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:14,720
overlaps with some metro and it goes up

205
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:21,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to 10 10 kilometers and 40 kilometers</font>

206
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:23,540
and even higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the last real big</font>

207
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:27,470
debate now is the fiber optics

208
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,449
discussion so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there the multimode fiber</font>

209
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,000
some people want to do multimode fiber

210
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:36,170
whether that's needed or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not single mode</font>

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,329
fiber<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also been considered but the</font>

212
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,009
more interesting conversations there's a

213
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:43,939
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are looking at some pixel</font>

214
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:47,149
pixel support DWDM within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Syria</font>

215
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:50,690
within the single mode fiber or even

216
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:54,410
cereal has also been concerns about or

217
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,240
talks about ribbon cable and even just

218
00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:01,219
having multiple ports with multiple

219
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,569
fibers plugged in so the one of the

220
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,310
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> things is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the standards</font>

221
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:07,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the objectives haven't been defined</font>

222
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:09,410
yet so there's a big need for the

223
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:12,199
operators to have influenced about what

224
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:14,000
they need whether a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

225
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:15,800
discussions are fit with the

226
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,569
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they have today and</font>

227
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,000
fits the needs that they have in the

00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:23,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">future you can find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out more information</font>
