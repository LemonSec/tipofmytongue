1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,390
so welcome and thank you for having us

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:09,030
it's great to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be here all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that so</font>

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,700
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a strange panel</font>

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:16,049
and so what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through is</font>

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,279
do really fast introduction of context

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what we think we're going to talk</font>

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,439
about so that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who find that</font>

8
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,170
dreary and annoying can leave or just do

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,000
IRC that's fine too and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest of</font>

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,789
you can get all riled up and cranky<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,159
we can have a good honest discussion /

12
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,290
argument about this which I think the

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,319
the talk immediately preceding this

14
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,610
definitely led into so so here's what we

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,879
think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do we think we're</font>

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,860
i'm going to give five minutes of what

17
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,379
we think we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing we're going to get</font>

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,320
very short statements from the panelists

19
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:53,370
answering some loaded questions designed

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,440
to provoke controversy see<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did that</font>

21
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,510
just for my cues go a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> british</font>

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,730
thing going on um then we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

23
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,500
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> debate amongst the crowd up here</font>

24
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,959
not because we like to hear ourselves

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,880
talk so much as what we want to do is

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,520
get the discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> going and give you</font>

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">all a flavor of where people are coming</font>

28
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,089
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what their positions are on</font>

29
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,400
some of these issues and then finally

30
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,900
the bulk of the time we'd like to devote

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the kind of conversation that just</font>

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,159
got started about what kind of mess were

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,250
in and whether there's any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of it</font>

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,310
and what that would look like so here's

35
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,840
the context I believe and I think some

36
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,180
of the panelists may also believe but i

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,610
won't i won't blame them for this that

38
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,850
there are a ton of v6 skeptics out there

39
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,259
and people who are rabid v6 proponents

40
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,140
believe that all people who think

41
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,649
anything is wrong with v6 are lazy or

42
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,329
ignorant and into some examining many of

43
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,030
us are lazy and ignorant and sometimes

44
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,889
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> about v6 but it's not universally</font>

45
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">the case there are many smart clue full</font>

46
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,119
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who run networks well maybe it is</font>

47
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,829
but it's not really so there are many

48
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,630
smart clue<font color="#E5E5E5"> full people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who run good</font>

49
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,699
networks who know what they're doing who

50
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,070
think that v6 is somewhat are a complete

51
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,479
train wreck and what I see in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> disco</font>

52
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,939
and I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's perfectly</font>

53
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,399
okay to say those people are wrong and

54
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,619
they may well be wrong but what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">see is that perspective really coming</font>

56
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">out in public conversation and so I</font>

57
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,010
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

58
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,569
does the entire community and the future

59
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">of our profession a disservice to not</font>

60
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:23,369
raise these questions very publicly and

61
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,708
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are simply wrong then let's</font>

62
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,269
put forth good solid arguments about why

63
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:29,879
they're wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> and why everything is is</font>

64
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:32,580
rosy and hunky dory and continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

65
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,319
other discussions and debates so there's

66
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that piece and then the other piece is</font>

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,518
that everyone acknowledges even very

68
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,290
very serious v6 proponents who think

69
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,299
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only solution and must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be done</font>

70
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,859
immediately that the rollout is mostly

71
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,560
stalled allocations and new

72
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,890
announcements peaked in 2003 there's no

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic there's no users there's no</font>

74
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,970
reason yet and nobody's positive when

75
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,290
the IP space runs out and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

76
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,859
main reason that everyone's looking for

77
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">so in the context of those two issues</font>

78
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:03,870
here are the key questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

79
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have the panel address and the</font>

80
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,349
questions are intentionally loaded so

81
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,640
I'll state the questions and then I'll

82
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:10,109
introduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> the panel and they will</font>

83
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,328
provide their own answers to each of

84
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,420
these questions so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

85
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:18,810
questions is how bad is v6 will<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

86
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:23,100
else be at all even plausibly better and

87
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,750
who could should will do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

88
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,060
it which I think the the presentation

89
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,579
immediately before this raised<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

90
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,440
interesting issues about that the key

91
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:32,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is we discussed this as a panel</font>

92
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,150
leading up to this that pretty much

93
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:39,569
colors all of your other answers is how

94
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,690
long do we have so there are many many

95
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:44,369
numbers floating out there some people's

96
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,340
numbers have already been obviated by

97
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,019
time because two thousand six or five

98
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,350
has come and gone and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we still have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> V</font>

99
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,930
for allocation space but there's some

100
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,900
future out there that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming where we</font>

101
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,250
won't and so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are key questions of</font>

102
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:02,340
when that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and the implicit question</font>

103
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:05,160
is do we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to make any</font>

104
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,099
significant fixes if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is v6</font>

105
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,630
has anything wrong with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font>

106
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,149
remaining questions are are there any

107
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,040
ways to extend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and what the</font>

108
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,858
heck happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> to scalable routing so</font>

109
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,889
with those in mind let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me go through the</font>

110
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:21,978
panelists will start with answers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

111
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:24,210
those questions on the left Dave Meyer

112
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:24,710
what were those questions oh yeah all

113
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:29,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font>

114
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:32,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright doctor Regis okay so um as many</font>

115
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,900
of you okay so how bad is d 6 um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

116
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:37,909
know what what I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> off with um was</font>

117
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so I got nominated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and put on the</font>

118
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,509
IAB and I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to myself okay you</font>

119
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:42,860
know here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ietf maybe they're</font>

120
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:43,880
supposed to be maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is answer to</font>

121
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,500
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these should or could and you</font>

122
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,150
want to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and I</font>

123
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,470
thought well oh well<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I'm</font>

124
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:51,138
hanging around with my friends here and

125
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,280
nanog in this community and you know

126
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:53,840
it's pretty clear that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

127
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,388
scalable routing and addressing

128
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,419
architecture for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet at least</font>

129
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:01,460
in the ipv6 context and certainly a lot

130
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:03,229
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would argue in ipv4 context as</font>

131
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,489
well so I thought well hey you know

132
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:07,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're on the IAB maybe that's something</font>

133
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:10,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">to look at seems like a problem so I've</font>

134
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">spent the last you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know two years really</font>

135
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,460
banging on that and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried a couple</font>

136
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,990
of different things we did the blob

137
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,120
thing that didn't work too well because

138
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,440
there are a lot of political reasons why

139
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,330
that didn't work too well so then we

140
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,889
decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> well hey maybe we'll hold a</font>

141
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,359
workshop because that's when the buttons

142
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,580
the IAB can push they really can't do

143
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,530
that much but we can organize people so

144
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,940
we're going to try that and that would

145
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,530
be next<font color="#E5E5E5"> week it was by the way it was</font>

146
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,789
really difficult to organize that it

147
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,039
continues to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to organize</font>

148
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:35,360
that can't get all the people you want

149
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">get some of the people you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font>

150
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">all that kind of stuff and it's</font>

151
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,258
troublesome but you know we had to try

152
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,849
to do something and so I'm kind of at

153
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point with you know on the who could</font>

154
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:48,229
or should do something about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm very</font>

155
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">skeptical that the IETF can't do</font>

156
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:52,008
anything about this but we're going to

157
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:56,479
try at least in my tenure on the IAB one

158
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:58,400
more time so Dave your main issue is v6

159
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,190
is bad because there's no scalable

160
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,669
routing and the IAB maybe can fix it but

161
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:06,620
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure um I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that it's my</font>

162
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:09,859
job to grocery eiffel by yoga it's

163
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,000
grossly simplifying yeah sure I don't

164
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,320
know there's no scalable routing

165
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,940
architecture that's going to be bad no

166
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,719
matter what the substrate is right so

167
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:20,240
that's a problem and regarding the IETF

168
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:21,830
like I said it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now and</font>

169
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,229
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see any real evidence than</font>

170
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:30,320
anything else is going on so that's you

171
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:31,550
know that's troublesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that</font>

172
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,909
also answers to what happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

173
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,010
scalable routing question

174
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:37,940
I mean well we didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything about</font>

175
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:41,640
it that's what happened to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

176
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">dan Goulding sure how bad is v6 well</font>

177
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,810
it's it's pretty bad when we're in a

178
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,250
situation where we're getting reasonably

179
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,110
close to vie for adoption and we're

180
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,600
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have presentations like like</font>

181
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,370
Marla's presentation that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just had we</font>

182
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,350
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be having presentations like</font>

183
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,550
Marla's presentation at this point it's

184
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,320
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say she shouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have given that</font>

185
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,750
presentation it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that she</font>

186
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,099
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have had to so we're in kind</font>

187
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,380
of bad shape because we have to be able

188
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to multi home we need scalable routing</font>

189
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,310
we need something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendors and</font>

190
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,860
the operators can live with the IETF has

191
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,870
fiddled while Rome has burnt and and now

192
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,300
we're in kind of a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad</font>

193
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,340
position how long do we have well I I

194
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,680
think 2011 is a reasonable number I

195
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,780
think some of the alarmist we're going

196
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to run out of address space in 2007 have</font>

197
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,729
been proven inaccurate but I think

198
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,500
Jeff's numbers are good I think we're

199
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to we may be forced to have a</font>

200
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,640
market for IP address allocation I know

201
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,490
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people who find that to</font>

202
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,570
be the devil<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think there's not</font>

203
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna be a lot of choice because I don't</font>

204
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,150
I think no matter what solution would go

205
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,080
with we're not going to be ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

212
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,940

v4 and v6 plans and I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are you</font>

216
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,370
going to do when the v4 space runs out

217
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,169
they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> laugh and say want me to buy</font>

218
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">something and i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say whether</font>

219
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:10,590
you're not gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to do that</font>

220
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,120
and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say stop me well</font>

221
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,130
you know good luck you're not gonna be

222
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to stop them and the scalable</font>

223
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,550
routing issue is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has to</font>

224
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:20,849
be resolved now it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be resolved</font>

225
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:23,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">separately what we're trying to use v6</font>

226
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:26,430
and policy to resolve a scalable routing

227
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,950
issue that is somewhat disconnected I

228
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:31,410
mean it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve that and then at</font>

229
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:33,840
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same time but in a different track</font>

230
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:37,190
figure out what our next IP routing

231
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:41,070
protocol is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

232
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:43,200
Jason Sean so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I think about this</font>

233
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:47,430
I think about this in two ways the first

234
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,350
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is v6 had a very narrow charter we</font>

235
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,770
were running out of addresses we wanted

236
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,180
more we have plenty now so v6 has done a

237
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:58,290
great job of that we have lots<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

238
00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:00,239
addresses hooray the problem is it

239
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,040
really hasn't considered all the

240
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,500
problems that these extra addresses are

241
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,170
creating and and those really need to be

242
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,640
addressed and without addressing those

243
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:14,189
problems having lots of addresses

244
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:16,220
doesn't help you very much so yeah so

245
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,750
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to continue the conversation</font>

246
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:21,030
panelists will debate ask each other

247
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,910
antagonize each other as they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

248
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,560
when they say things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think are</font>

249
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,689
woefully incorrect or hatefully wrong

250
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,339
make a note of that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when I asked</font>

251
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:33,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">for audience participation you'll be</font>

252
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:35,310
ready to go so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of</font>

253
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,920
amplify a little bit on Jason's point

254
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:40,619
which was I think ipv6 has really

255
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,660
exacerbated things by by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the virtue of</font>

256
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,420
the very problem it was trying to solve

257
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,770
which is larger address space and if you

258
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,780
couple that with no<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to do</font>

259
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:51,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing no way to do routing none</font>

260
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that what you find out is it's in a</font>

261
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,440
scalable way in a scale boy yeah yeah

262
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,120
let that be the case we want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

263
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,470
ok so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you can do a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

264
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,960
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't work I mean like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean we</font>

265
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,940
built a lot of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't work</font>

266
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,050
but the problem really is this look

267
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,110
what's happening right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now what we're</font>

268
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:09,150
doing is recreating the ipv4 swamp which

269
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:12,420
we worked so hard to get rid of at a

270
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">massive scale that you know it really</font>

271
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,170
won't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very tractable if it actually</font>

272
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,420
unfolds the way it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking like it</font>

273
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,370
could so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things put</font>

274
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,550
together add up to something very very

275
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,230
dire yeah and I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

276
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,569
important questions really is how long

277
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:31,710
do we have and there's various

278
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:33,750
projections 2016 2012 2008 I don't know

279
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,600
maybe we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have v6 adoption in 20 28</font>

280
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:39,960
when Bernie gets out of prison the point

281
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,430
here is what's not under debate is we're

282
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">running out we will run out at some</font>

283
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,270
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we will have to do something</font>

284
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:48,320
different and

285
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:51,210
as an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP who delivers internet service</font>

286
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,800
we really have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be aggressive on when</font>

287
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,960
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that date maybe because if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

288
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,620
date comes here then we're ready or

289
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,050
prepared for we're screwed well so so

290
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,940
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> address that specifically Jason</font>

291
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,069
and and we'll all of you but Jason so

292
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,170
how much time do you think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have and</font>

293
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:09,300
what kind of fixes are you willing to

294
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,770
entertain can we change the header

295
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,020
format should we leave a header format

296
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,760
oh can you shoe horn scalable routing

297
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,520
into the existing header format somehow

298
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,530
so on the question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much time do</font>

299
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,670
we have I don't know I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

300
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,949
have been some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that have done</font>

301
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:28,560
some good work on this the numbers that

302
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:30,630
bookend it right now or 2008-2012 Vint

303
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,520
Cerf said you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we're not going</font>

304
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,650
to run out by 2010 but there'll be so

305
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:38,250
much pressure on address space that all

306
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:40,290
would be fulfilled by v6 I have to be

307
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,390
ready I have to be ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> by 2010 whether</font>

308
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,069
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop-dead date or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not because</font>

309
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:47,610
if that does turn out to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop</font>

310
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:52,290
date dead and I'm not ready then I don't

311
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:54,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an hour to sell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question so</font>

312
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,939
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suggested doing and</font>

313
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is more of a research problem or</font>

314
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,190
issue is to kind of look at whether or

315
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,100
not it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be possible to preserve</font>

316
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:07,560
some of the investment if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

317
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,150
that oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> well maybe ipv6 isn't gonna</font>

318
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,680
isn't going to get us there in the time

319
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:12,689
we want in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current structure of</font>

320
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,550
things whether or not it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

321
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,860
possible to preserve<font color="#E5E5E5"> our investment in</font>

322
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,329
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff around v6 like</font>

323
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,480
forwarding engines and things like that

324
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:24,840
and use the packet format not

325
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,730
necessarily be all of the protocol

326
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,620
machinery<font color="#CCCCCC"> that went around it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

327
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know if that's possible or not but</font>

328
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,610
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been looking at it a little bit</font>

329
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,620
with some chip guys at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco Llewyn it</font>

330
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:38,040
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

331
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">a design around that first so yeah all</font>

332
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so the the the crowds queuing up</font>

333
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:44,280
already which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what we hope</font>

334
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:48,060
for so so Joel I think you were there

335
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:50,459
Jolie<font color="#CCCCCC"> egli while we're on the subject of</font>

336
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:53,520
dates I mean the one that scares me is

337
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,230
what's the date when the ipv6 routing

338
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,170
system looks as bad as the IP

339
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,820
before routing system well I I mean

340
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:04,290
that's that's that's sort of the point

341
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:06,630
of no<font color="#CCCCCC"> return I thank right because that</font>

342
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,870
means ipv6 has been successful enough

343
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:12,570
that it's deployed<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we</font>

344
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:15,150
have to worry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean in all</font>

345
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,100
honesty well then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

346
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:20,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be here because it won't become</font>

347
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,530
relevant well here's the thing we need a

348
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:24,210
new routing system we need a new address

349
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:27,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">and system there are necessarily linked</font>

350
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:29,490
together you know we can hopefully reuse

351
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,170
significant parts of v6 like the packet

352
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,850
header but I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to be</font>

353
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting around kind of being worried</font>

354
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:37,770
that you know v6 will be successful

355
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">because at this point just looking at</font>

356
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:42,060
the adoption<font color="#E5E5E5"> the adoption has really</font>

357
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,710
been been very little look at China I

358
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,750
mean Asia was supposed to drive v6

359
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,370
adoption there you have networks that

360
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,040
are being forced by the government to

361
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,960
run v6 but it's all ipv4 traffic that

362
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">their tunnel well I mean if it's not</font>

363
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,500
successful then we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a routing</font>

364
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,210
scalability problem and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can declare</font>

365
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">victory and go home it just means that</font>

366
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:01,710
we're that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> just means that we're</font>

367
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,480
all living in v4 land well no it needs

368
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:05,010
we're still stuck in v4 land with the

369
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,120
problems that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> here which is</font>

370
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,870
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run out of address space</font>

371
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,370
right yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm the perception from from</font>

372
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,040
a lot of folks from enterprises from a

373
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,680
lot of operators is that you know v6 has

374
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:18,810
all the problems of v4 and meets few of

375
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,359
our requirements and larger address

376
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:26,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">space yeah and larger addresses who you</font>

377
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:28,860
know Randy Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> bush</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jay um first</font>

378
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:31,770
Todd if you haven't heard publicly

379
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,300
loudly the v6 is sorely broken you

380
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:37,980
shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you should be an ear</font>

381
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:40,920
doctor um secondly the global routing

382
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:44,520
scaling problem is one of global state

383
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:48,829
and scoping nobody is addressing this in

384
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:52,350
any reasonable fashion anywhere three is

385
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:55,380
the issue in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> routing table that we</font>

386
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:58,230
have today makes very clear that hacks

387
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:00,030
such a separation of location identifier

388
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,940
which is the current sub religion in the

389
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">IETF is not going to solve because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

390
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,680
you actually look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing table</font>

391
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:11,820
today you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see that the majority of</font>

392
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:15,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">the prefixes are there either for</font>

393
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,820
somebody's traffic engineering which

394
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,650
more address space and other things and

395
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,350
bloke that song so far not going to

396
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:24,689
solve or are there because people like

397
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:27,390
Time Warner telecom take their address

398
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,670
space and slice it<font color="#CCCCCC"> up into / 24 s</font>

399
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:37,620
because they think it solves a security

400
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:41,160
problem namely route hijacking thank you

401
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you thank you but lots of people</font>

402
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">do it the majority of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> routing table</font>

403
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:50,670
contains that the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach that we</font>

404
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:53,400
have for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's yet another hack</font>

405
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:57,810
is decent routing security so they won't

406
00:15:53,400 --> 00:16:00,180
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that need and to address traffic</font>

407
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:07,619
engineering with something other than

408
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:09,150
wires over IP over wires is that just do

409
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,340
we have deafening silence from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> panel</font>

410
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,660
on any of that we could be done so

411
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,760
usually when Randy talks thing you're

412
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,339
done it I'll just say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't disagree</font>

413
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:21,689
with anything that Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> just said can</font>

414
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:25,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go home now I'm it's an elantra</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> home</font>

415
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">come comcast I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came here essentially</font>

416
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,280
thinking which was a physics magmatic

417
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:31,949
panel work people were<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the panel will</font>

418
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,449
have opposite sides and can<font color="#CCCCCC"> surprise to</font>

419
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:36,120
see but<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody's on the same side on</font>

420
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,860
this panel so a little bit surprising so

421
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,420
I decided to I Jack this process and

422
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,820
kami on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> microphone to say that the</font>

423
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">kennedys agree with you this is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

424
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,270
hijacking of the process this is the

425
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,580
process as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was designed it's working</font>

426
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:50,730
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great if you design it to be</font>

427
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">hijacked that's fine so our bodies v6</font>

428
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">pledge your answer myself or questions</font>

429
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,890
my guess which bad because there's a

430
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:58,740
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have never been</font>

431
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,880
completely thought offer and what

432
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,350
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be scalable routing</font>

433
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,360
protocols is one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there are</font>

434
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,010
many others like okay you have this huge

435
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,079
actual space what do you do with reverse

436
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:09,260
DNS what do you do with the EGP<font color="#CCCCCC"> Atlas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

437
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:12,359

438
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,530
filters and how do you manage the

439
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,270
certain space a lot of this question

440
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">have never been answered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's kind</font>

441
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,658
of normal because we have just starting

442
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,358
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deploy this stuff</font>

443
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:23,369
so we are learning now out to solve

444
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:25,678
those problems are they're big enough

445
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:28,138
problems to solve for deployment in my

446
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:32,220
personal opinion no we can still do that

447
00:17:28,138 --> 00:17:37,080
so a long do we have in our case<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

448
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:39,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially minus one year because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

449
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,178
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> ran out of private address</font>

450
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,220
space last year talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us oh so your</font>

451
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:47,129
claim is that we're currently out of

452
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:49,259
unallocated v4 space as of last year I'm

453
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:51,689
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as of last year this has</font>

454
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:55,289
become a huge problem a<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical problem</font>

455
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:57,509
in my company and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to need a</font>

456
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:59,940
very very large amount of addresses can

457
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:04,559
see my previous presentation at<font color="#E5E5E5"> nano or</font>

458
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">sand in san jose in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> june this year we</font>

459
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,039
are going to need<font color="#E5E5E5"> several hundred</font>

460
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:10,889
million IP addresses in the near future

461
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:12,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to consider how</font>

462
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:15,629
we are going to get those swings so it's

463
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,190
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> video really serious in image problem</font>

464
00:18:15,629 --> 00:18:19,049
so you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about okay market</font>

465
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:22,440
allocation of addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's do</font>

466
00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:25,649
some quick math here let's say one

467
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,210
dollar an IP address per month but since

468
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:29,158
like a reasonable figured you know

469
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:32,039
really how much money this means it

470
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:36,239
means 44 / 8 we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking essentially</font>

471
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:37,769
at 1 billion dollar over 10 years and I

472
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:40,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know about any company that's</font>

473
00:18:37,769 --> 00:18:42,119
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay 1 billion dollar over 10</font>

474
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:45,330
years for / 8 the way we need something

475
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:47,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">like 10 or 20 or maybe 30 overs this is</font>

476
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:50,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply not going to work well for things</font>

477
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,960
going to work hold on a sec how are you

478
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting to 1 billion dollars using using</font>

479
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,869
an e really seeing whether you talking

480
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,820
about one dollar per IP address / years

481
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:58,289
sort of thing is that we you're talking

482
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,830
about one dollar<font color="#CCCCCC"> per IP address but</font>

483
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:04,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">month under what scheme has that ever</font>

484
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,639
been proposed by anyone and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

485
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,189
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number that is very easy to</font>

486
00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:09,959
think about that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

487
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,519
something that is low value<font color="#CCCCCC"> K put two</font>

488
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,989
dolla em off if you have people are

489
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,220
paying something like 30 bucks a month

490
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:17,700
to get service<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe one dollar</font>

491
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:19,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">amorphouse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not that stupid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we</font>

492
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,139
are talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a lot of money here if</font>

493
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:23,969
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a market I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

494
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:26,219
you're I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think anyone has proposed</font>

495
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,250
the idea of renting IP addresses for a

496
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,360
dollar a month

497
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,980
III don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's what we're</font>

498
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,969
talking about with a market where the

499
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,350
market we're not really talking about

500
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:36,720
Lisa's or rentals we're talking about

501
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:39,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ability of folks to sell IP</font>

502
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,340
addresses to each other in order to lint

503
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:44,250
in the because right now if you look at

504
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:46,709
the ipv4 address space the allocation is

505
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,960
very poor in Syria and even there's a

506
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of hoarding I you know everyone here</font>

507
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,590
knows all the examples of extreme

508
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,120
hoarding and actually many of the

509
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,500
examples of extreme hoarding are in this

510
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">room yeah many the examples of extreme</font>

511
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">wordings instrument there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of in</font>

512
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,590
the enterprise space as well it's been a

513
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,200
historical a historic problem the method

514
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:06,178
we have of allocation now tends to lead

515
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,440
to hoarding not just VIP dress is really

516
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:12,929
bit of any kind of thing and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a</font>

517
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,169
market you know we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

518
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:18,600
increase our utilization efficiency

519
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:20,549
greatly in order to give us more time to

520
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,439
figure out a solution because right now

521
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:25,110
as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start from the last presentation</font>

522
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,700
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a viable ipv6 solution</font>

523
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,590
that fits the requirements of most folks

524
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,480
well that's one point of view<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

525
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:32,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point of view</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but if</font>

526
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,980
you don't do v6 now there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

527
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,320
alternative solution on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the table so</font>

528
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,179
fast you are forced into this market

529
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,820
solution where you are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay a</font>

530
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,950
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so essentially a question</font>

531
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,570
is because we don't have scalable

532
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,580
watching in v6 means that we should

533
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">never do v6 and we should go back to the</font>

534
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:52,350
drawing board and start over from

535
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,080
scratch I think my position is somewhat

536
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:58,408
different is if we don't do v6 with that

537
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:02,460
essentially so would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do this season</font>

538
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:06,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be forced into reinventing later on</font>

539
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:08,610
the road a scalable solution as we have

540
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:11,279
to make sure that we put we do not put

541
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:15,449
the horse before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the carriage here and</font>

542
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:19,289
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have more addresses period so</font>

543
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:22,049
are you proposing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do ipv6 like ipv4</font>

544
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:24,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">fpi address space kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of cruise forward</font>

545
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:25,799
on our current routing situation and

546
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,010
then at some point in the future fix

547
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:32,340
that essentially yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay did that</font>

548
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:34,830
that's I have a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you know</font>

549
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:37,408
there's some unused address space like

550
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:39,100
the so-called<font color="#E5E5E5"> classy address space so</font>

551
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:40,900
that classic d address

552
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">bass I mean there might be a possibility</font>

553
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,549
of repurposing some of that stuff for

554
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:47,830
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know to kind of get a little</font>

555
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:49,000
more life out of the v4 system and we

556
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,860
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really investigated that one</font>

557
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,200
either I think when we did someone just

558
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">look and if you can find if you can</font>

559
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,549
certify that every single vendor in the

560
00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:01,030
universe will work with both kind of

561
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:05,440
addresses then thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know fighting</font>

562
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:06,940
into my eighth hey hey do I don't pull

563
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:16,900
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference over and I will drive it</font>

564
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:17,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">home sorry guy gonna do so the proposals</font>

565
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,830

space and v6 and hope to fix it later

568
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:27,789
2005 one forever man can we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:29,500
vendors at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mic when am I gonna see</font>

570
00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:32,950
some routers that can hold millions of

<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a vector Chris I'm not a I'm not</font>

573
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:41,860
a router vendor it they don't let me

574
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:43,179
design networks are you kidding so um I

575
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,469
have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry i'm chris from</font>

rising business um so I this has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

577
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,230
couple of discussions like this in the

578
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,460
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple days and so what problem are</font>

579
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">we really trying to solve is it the fact</font>

580
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,539
that people use<font color="#CCCCCC"> some craziness and bgp</font>

581
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do traffic engineering which is what</font>

582
00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:01,450
Randy basically said to some extent is

583
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,850
it that there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be too many</font>

584
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,950
routes if we turn on v6 today equal to

585
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,299
v4 or in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's going to be</font>

586
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,559
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> many routes is it too many routes</font>

587
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:10,450
because of the traffic engineering

588
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,190
artifacts or is it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's too</font>

589
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,070
many destinations that have unique

590
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:20,080
prefixes /<font color="#CCCCCC"> 32s in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the instance of</font>

591
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:23,110
today's policy so whatever comes out of

592
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,970
this maybe it's not bgp as you know it

593
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,789
today maybe there's a new bgp which

594
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,530
maybe means there's a new tcp/ip as well

595
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:31,510
because there's some difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

596
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,158
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an IP address is today</font>

597
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,890

600
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,030
not my purview but solving the right

601
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,770
problem is the important part if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

602
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:48,460
right problem is that in 10 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:51,340
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jam 30,000 updates through</font>

my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardware in my router</font>

605

down to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fib can I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that today I</font>

606
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:59,680
don't know what if I have to do three

607
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:01,450
hundred thousand that figure out the

608
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,390
right problem you're trying to solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

609
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,890
solve that but we get distracted with

610
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:09,910
the traffic engineering discussion I

611
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:12,040
think well so so one of the questions

612
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,710
that that I've heard up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and heard</font>

613
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,000
other people raises it isn't it kind of

614
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,640
late in the game to be having this

615
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,490
conversation like I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said the</font>

616
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,440
last person maybe it's five years maybe

617
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:25,780
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more but every day we</font>

618
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,060
sit here is one day less to solve it

619
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,889
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at least two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

620
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:32,379
from my company<font color="#CCCCCC"> to certify any new code</font>

621
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,870
that has any new protocol so now i have

622
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:39,010
less than three years please get me

623
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:40,929
something that works all right that may

624
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,670
be but if you had that to roll out at

625
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,170
some new routing protocol it's not going

626
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:46,330
to happen tomorrow for you either and

627
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:48,820
you know damn well that your vendor is

628
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:55,960
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you bug free software</font>

629
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:59,120
on the first time I I don't own my

630
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:02,650

unfortunately for those of us in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

635
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:15,080
government sector which are sort of

straddle the date is 2008 period no

637
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,870
exceptions because OMB has said we will

638
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:24,379
run ipv6 no exceptions or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your</font>

639
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:25,909
funding shut off in 2008 so lots and

00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,590
lots of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the government think</font>

644
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,820
together discuss implementation of ipv6

645
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,190
since you've already<font color="#CCCCCC"> done it and we have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">no idea I've been getting a lot of those</font>

know we're running cons and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see LNS</font>

650
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,160
today so just just answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work a lot</font>

of government<font color="#CCCCCC"> agencies and have and</font>

including some inserted the defensive

type sector of agencies the ones you

654
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:57,260
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be sort of behind this and</font>

you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,379
spending a lot of money now on

consultants to do two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is to</font>

658
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,200
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out how to implement it</font>

659
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,730
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other is to get them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to write</font>

660
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,590
papers saying why they shouldn't

661
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,740
implement it that they can send to the

662
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:11,689
OMB yeah you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a feeling</font>

663
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,300
in government that this is a ridiculous

664
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:15,860
unfunded mandate and that they have huge

665
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,050
other problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend</font>

666
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">their money on and and the interesting</font>

667
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the most part</font>

668
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,370
has plenty of IP addresses if you

669
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:24,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually look at the ipv4 address space</font>

670
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,209
you know and almost everything is matted

671
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:29,179
and government for security reasons

672
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:33,110
anyway you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is really case</font>

673
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:35,570
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suspect the vendors have have</font>

674
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:39,080
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad things that the router vendors</font>

675
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:41,120
have have influenced people in the US

676
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,919
government at least and certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

677
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,300
Asian governments to do stuff that they

678
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,360
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done which which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

679
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:50,300
mandate ipv6 by 2008 and it's it's

680
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,129
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of crowd absolutely it's</font>

681
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,360
well as Ben said a moment ago if you

682
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,910
didn't if everybody didn't hear him

683
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,709
gossip v2 I mean yes we've all been

684
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">there we've all tripped over it well</font>

685
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,350
those of us are old enough have been

686
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">there and tripped over it and we're not</font>

687
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:04,219
real happy about having to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it again</font>

688
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,678
as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as writing white papers back long</font>

689
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:09,260
before the OMB mandate came out we wrote

690
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:12,140
a very long detailed explanation to OMB

691
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,860
of why this from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> East</font>

692
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,770
perspective

693
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,780
was a very very bad idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can see</font>

694
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:19,730
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> will I be responded to our long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

695
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,700
very thoughtful document on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the subject</font>

696
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,620
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not at all convinced it's going</font>

697
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,150
to happen I've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretend it's going</font>

698
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,760
to happen and make darn sure it can

699
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,960
happen if nothing changes down the road

700
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,379
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only one in that</font>

701
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,880
position yeah I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say that if</font>

702
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,490
you're here and you work for a major

703
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,290
router vendor that you know of course

704
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,420
you're not personally responsible but

705
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:44,330
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should ponder the fact that your</font>

706
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:45,980
company has pressured government

707
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,260
officials<font color="#E5E5E5"> into implementing something</font>

708
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,360
that is clearly not ready to bloom be

709
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:54,520
implemented and that that is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

710
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,520
sort of questionable ethical standing

711
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,418
excellent over on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the far side hi Josh</font>

712
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:04,399
level is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to education network some</font>

713
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:05,780
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us actually have ipv6 deployed in the</font>

714
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,700
backbone in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the starting</font>

715
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">center provision down to the desktop and</font>

716
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,330
there's no there's not a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

717
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,950
using it but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last three years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

718
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,840
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make decisions all the decisions</font>

719
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">on what we buy software hardware</font>

720
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,649
everything we're looking at well can we

721
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:22,520
support ipv6 with this you know

722
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:24,169
deployment so for me if I being here you

723
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we've heard nothing but gripes</font>

724
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:28,340
about ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of which I frankly agree</font>

725
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,440
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> well if this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is gonna be a</font>

726
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,178
pragmatic discussion of v6 maybe the

727
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,370
panel could take<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a few minutes and</font>

728
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:36,260
describe or explain maybe there are

729
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:38,030
alternatives their ideas on solutions

730
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,379
how we could solve it rather than

731
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:42,049
listening to the same tribes we've been

732
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:46,520
hearing the last five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep thanks</font>

733
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:49,429
so just give that a shot go well so what

734
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:52,490
I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it my personal input to that</font>

735
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:55,220
one was I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the IAB and I tried to</font>

736
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">push on it as hard as I could and what</font>

737
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:59,090
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing right now is we're going to</font>

738
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:01,820
hold an workshop next week in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amsterdam</font>

739
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,250
where we're going to try to really come

740
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,600
away with a concise problem statement

741
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,070
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we don't know what the</font>

742
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,330
problem statement is but it's like more

743
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,549
like what Chris was saying we need to

744
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:12,770
calm and understanding of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and come</font>

745
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:14,480
away with that as a substrate for future

746
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,100
work and then we'll test and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the</font>

747
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,700
IEG<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do anything about</font>

748
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,480
this but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my perspective</font>

749
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,370
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of routing</font>

750
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,389
research out there there's a lot of lot

751
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,518
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on in</font>

752
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:27,109
various sto standards developing

753
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,269
organizations and stuff around us but

754
00:29:27,109 --> 00:29:32,059
none of that work as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I can tell</font>

755
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:33,349
is directly linked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our community here</font>

756
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:36,019
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a lot of it just misses the</font>

757
00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:37,729
problem altogether so that's what I did

758
00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:39,679
about it now your question was do you

759
00:29:37,729 --> 00:29:41,149
have a solution to it well you know if I

760
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,829
did I probably wouldn't tell you because

761
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:44,299
you know I'd be about patenting it or

762
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:46,279
something like that but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you know</font>

763
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:48,440
it's a real hard problem obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

764
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:51,049
we got to start somewhere and like Chris

765
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,489
again like Chris said<font color="#CCCCCC"> today's the best</font>

766
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:53,869
day to start so that's what I tried to

767
00:29:52,489 --> 00:29:58,129
do that's that that was the approach i

768
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:59,749
took<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd have to say that the approach</font>

769
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,579
that can work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have talked up</font>

770
00:29:59,749 --> 00:30:03,379
here a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about is that there's</font>

771
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:06,799
been a tremendous investment into the

772
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:08,449
ipv6 packet header so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we'll you</font>

773
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the ipv6 packet header is not</font>

774
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:12,499
particularly flawed I i think i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

775
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:14,509
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that's something we can all</font>

776
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:17,029
probably live with and craft a solution

777
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:18,950
on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think at this point we have</font>

778
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:20,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come to a couple realizations the</font>

779
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:23,419
realizations are for people who are ipv6

780
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:25,189
skeptics were running<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of ipv4 space</font>

781
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:27,950
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have something else there's</font>

782
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:31,219
simply no<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solution we can't do IP</font>

783
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:33,499
v.v for forever you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> be at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2011b</font>

784
00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:35,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">2025 yet you know but because of what</font>

785
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:37,609
Chris was talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our time frames</font>

786
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:40,129
are really much more limited than this

787
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:41,839
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest and even in a market-based</font>

788
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:43,129
solution we wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a perfect</font>

789
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,049
market-based solution let's face the

790
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:47,509
facts so we probably don't have until

791
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:50,389
2027 even in that scenario so what we

792
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:52,849
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is we need to get real and we</font>

793
00:30:50,389 --> 00:30:54,769
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say the IETF and no offense than</font>

794
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:56,958
anyone who's like is maybe offense to

795
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:59,389
people who are involved the ITF is that

796
00:30:56,959 --> 00:31:01,579
the ITF hasn't worked they've been

797
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:03,498
working on this for a long time and you

798
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:07,099
know insanity is usually defined as

799
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:08,629
someone who tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something at you</font>

800
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:09,649
know last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time it didn't work and the</font>

801
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:11,149
time before didn't work and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time</font>

802
00:31:09,649 --> 00:31:12,228
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> it didn't work you know you do</font>

803
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:13,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">something again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and hope you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

804
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:15,739
get a different result that's usually

805
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:17,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">just called Davidson yeah that's that</font>

806
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:20,389
sorry it's classically defined as

807
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:21,918
insanity so you know we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

808
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:25,968
situation where you have to see the IETF

809
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:28,039
is not cannot will not do it and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

810
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:31,530
point we need to look for other avenues

811
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:33,690
and other people sure yeah

812
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:35,190
yeah you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first person who said</font>

813
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:38,370
I'm insane so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna take any problem</font>

814
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:40,860
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's not the same there are</font>

815
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:42,629
new people with new ideas and that kind

816
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,860
of stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that exactly the fact that</font>

817
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:45,900
it's not the same now that we have

818
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,699
different people involved is what gives

819
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">me what little bit of hope I have that</font>

820
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,510
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can make something happen now</font>

821
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,250
I'll agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a huge</font>

822
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,990
uphill battle you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot</font>

823
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:59,310
and you know if the past is a good

824
00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:01,590
predictor<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future will then yeah so</font>

825
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:04,169
for me it's there's really a simple

826
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:06,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">decision that has to be made either we</font>

827
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:07,680
can continue what we've been doing we

828
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,510
can grow the routing table we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can beat</font>

829
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,520
up our vendors to produce year that's

830
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,930
bigger and hopefully they can and

831
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,650
somebody should seriously look at that

832
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:18,360
or we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something different</font>

833
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:20,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe a different protocol maybe not bgp</font>

834
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:24,659
maybe something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got hierarchy in</font>

835
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:29,000
the network I don't know maybe the

836
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:31,860
locator ID split will help this problem

837
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,480
maybe we can arrange<font color="#E5E5E5"> the locators in a</font>

838
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,459
way that it's dynamic and hierarchical

839
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,610
that can change as the routing topology

840
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:41,550
changes the question is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you map</font>

841
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:43,260
the locator to the ID how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that</font>

842
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,520
in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that scales and you end up with</font>

843
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:48,720
less state than what you had when

844
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,920

to make the routers bigger and better

and cooler and better cooling and better

but that gives you local scope to the

traffic engineering without having

it makes money for them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like</font>

880
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:24,320
to make money and so the largest routing

table generates the largest amount of

882
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,619

<font color="#CCCCCC">number of more specifics there's also</font>

884
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:30,409
one other thing that people need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep</font>

885
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:32,299
in mind here a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of solutions get</font>

886
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:34,700
proposed based on the idea that people

00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,899
are going to be good citizens and we

888

00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,690
you know people will deliberately limit

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know their psychology here we have</font>

routes either have no interest in being

896
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,460
altruistic because you know it's not

897
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,570
going to make their company money and

898
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore they should have no interest</font>

and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply won't do it that you</font>

00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,530
altruistic people are running DGP

because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not yeah with regard to</font>

period the two-tier the tier 2 ISPs are

that's going to affect what all tier 1

and tier two isps pretty

919
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,810
not sure I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to carry that</font>

route the internet the Internet yeah the

<font color="#E5E5E5">internet at three so just to follow up</font>

922
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:53,390
on my own<font color="#E5E5E5"> original comment I'm not</font>

923
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,370
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the panacea</font>

924
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:57,770
it's not going to solve everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

925
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:59,330
there are additional enforcement

926
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:03,259
mechanisms you could built into the

927
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:06,020
protocol such as a more specific should

928
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:09,010
only be accepted if it has any<font color="#E5E5E5"> s path</font>

929
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:11,870
limit on it that would prevent the edge

930
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:13,900
rogues from having something which can

931
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:17,120
be announced with indefinite amount of

932
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:20,150
scope but as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as there's a gradable</font>

933
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,410
and it's a PA space address then it

934
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,410
makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to actually be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

935
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:25,819
created at some point so if somebody

936
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:27,710
wants to multi home and do traffic

937
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:31,250
engineering that UPI space is that what

938
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:32,930
you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes the p.i space by</font>

939
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,120
definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be given out anybody</font>

940
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:37,160
who needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to multi home and if everyone</font>

941
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">who's multi humming gets p I space we're</font>

942
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,960
gonna have less routes somehow the

943
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,669
theory goes that if you limit the scope

944
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,740
to the traffic engineering component of

945
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:47,720
that and you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody who's</font>

946
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:50,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-home to have a single prefix of</font>

947
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,370
arbitrary size appropriate to them

948
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:54,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">simoneau traffic engineering everyone</font>

949
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:56,299
gets one route everyone gets one route

950
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:58,850
and the ability to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make more specifics</font>

951
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:01,130
out of that with a scope limit on how

952
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:03,650
far that more specific gets announced

953
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:07,340
escape I meant like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS cup lemon yes</font>

954
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:09,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay the middle in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the background okay</font>

955
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:12,800
finally you thought I'd forgotten about

956
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:15,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">you right there you you yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i'm</font>

957
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,660
not a routing guy but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm in academia so</font>

958
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:20,029
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> dangerous one of the problems</font>

959
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:22,700
if i look at what research gets done in

960
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:25,760
that is that there tend to be reasonably

961
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:28,339
quest problems where you can identify a

962
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,440
specific problem reasonably<font color="#E5E5E5"> constraint</font>

963
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,360
parameters and what I'm hearing is that

964
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,850
the routing problem is really not a

965
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,230
routing problem but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's see we need to</font>

966
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,330
solve all problems from traffic

967
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:41,210
engineering to security to routing to

968
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:44,480
business models to who<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

969
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:46,220
politics all in one mechanism and any

970
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,220
one solution it's essentially impossible

971
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:51,649
for any one person to have a tall in the

<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i hearing you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

991
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:39,470
but it should magically work better when

992
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,940
how is that gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> work so I don't</font>

993
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:43,509
disagree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with what you're saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I</font>

994
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:45,710
think the difficult question here is

995
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:48,350
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the problems that are worth</font>

996
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:51,410
solving and what functionalities

997
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:52,850
everyone willing to give up what so now

998
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,319
get to get one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody's willing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to give up do you have any comments on</font>

1000
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,980
that but Jason no one's willing to give

1001
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,050
up functionality I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's be</font>

1002
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,190
perfectly honest well you know this has

1019
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:42,560
address space is costing the community

1020
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:44,359
at large why not make that a chargeable

1028
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:06,660
actually fully convinced<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the v6</font>

1029
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,850
problem is

1030
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:12,029
something that we need to necessarily

1031
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:14,580
even address at this point because well

1032
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:16,380
well there's a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues a number</font>

1033
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,420
of flaws and stacking on all sorts of

1034
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:22,020
extra headers and labels and all these

1035
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:24,330
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things on top where's the pain now</font>

1036
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,860
with the v6 so OMB told the US

1037
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:28,319
government they have to go and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1038
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,940
all the departments have to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do v6</font>

1039
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:34,260
but I don't really see where the pain is

1040
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:36,900
right now for everyone it's not like OMB

1041
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:39,180
and GSA are coming to every single

1042

to buy internet access from you they

1044
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:46,200
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through the same contractor</font>

1045
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:47,970
purchasing side stuff that they they do

00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything else through and it generally</font>

1047
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,240
end up with the same couple of providers

1048
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:55,200
and a cup and and one or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

1049

1055
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:16,049
this is even a real issue for

1056
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">ninety-nine percent of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people in</font>

1059

the government but for the rest of the

1062
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,940
people here there they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted</font>

1063
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:31,980
v6 and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't necessarily</font>

1064
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,420
represent a real issue to the operations

of their network<font color="#E5E5E5"> boys and jaron when did</font>

1066
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:37,140
you become a real issue you just got to

1067
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,690
go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the premise that we're gonna</font>

00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:41,790
run out of IP space at some point and if

1069
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:43,980
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that then what does the</font>

clock look like and if the clock is

1071
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:48,330
running you got n years to solve it

1072
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:50,549
we've shown that we're not particularly

1073
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:53,310
efficient at solving this problem you

1074
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:55,950
know so up up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I would</font>

1075
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:58,230
argue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no immediate</font>

1076
00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:00,330
incentive to fix the problem it's not

1077
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:02,130
like we're people are having to go

1078
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:03,690
through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> upgrade the memory in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1079
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:05,760
router is to hold larger routing tables

1080
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:08,220
and such and do other activities but

1081
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,110
they're not in a position where they've

1082
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:13,799
run out of the hardware forwarding space

1083
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:16,200
yet and in the cases where they are

1084
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,970
approaching some of those limits those

1085
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">people tend not to be on the latest</font>

greatest hardware that defender

1087
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:24,390
is currently shipping and so there is an

1088
00:42:21,979 --> 00:42:26,368
expensive path for them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take but</font>

1089
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:27,839
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not no path for them to take but</font>

1090
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:32,189
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jared when does it become a problem</font>

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:36,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">five years ten years III don't know when</font>

1092

1093
00:42:36,689 --> 00:42:40,049
run through a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these types of</font>

things before<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is this problem with</font>

1096
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,819
and then all of a sudden somebody

1097
00:42:42,749 --> 00:42:47,968
decided hey cool let's go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1098
00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:51,359

<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't forget</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that on that helps too I</font>

think I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a comment on where the</font>

a long time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to address</font>

1104
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:03,239
that one comment on pain there's a risk

1105
00:43:00,989 --> 00:43:06,390
re numbering is pain if there's a change

1106

to the v6 system after<font color="#CCCCCC"> a deployment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1107
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:10,920
causes pain okay I'm not it I'm not

1108
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:13,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily sure that the v6 system has</font>

space if that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem i'm not i'm</font>

1112
00:43:19,709 --> 00:43:24,479
not positive we understand this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,809
basically v4 with a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits and</font>

00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:38,339
some extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> space for some security</font>

necessarily if the solution is not

00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:50,519
that's sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what v6 provides solving</font>

1125
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:54,199
the scalability of the routing system or

1126
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:57,448
one word is something totally separate

1127
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:59,789
so is that you don't understand so your

1128
00:43:57,449 --> 00:44:01,979
point is v6 isn't a problem because

1129
00:43:59,789 --> 00:44:04,319
people aren't migrating to it yet we're

1130
00:44:01,979 --> 00:44:10,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">not out of v4 space yet and v6 isn't a</font>

1131
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:12,329
good solution anyway v6 is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution v6</font>

1132
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:14,849
is a solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's the</font>

1133
00:44:12,329 --> 00:44:16,799
best solution that we could engineer if

1134
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:20,429
we got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of the people of the</font>

1135
00:44:16,799 --> 00:44:21,929
very thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> together yeah but it is a</font>

1136
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:24,359
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's a solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font>

1137
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:26,670
are spending some amount of money on so

1138
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:28,499
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a small market for it so not</font>

1139
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:30,280
picking up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone in the room to</font>

1140
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:32,410
get a piece of it in

1141
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,030
same way the v4 is but there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a market</font>

1142
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,950
you know one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you said and I</font>

1143
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:38,260
thought someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else set it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which I</font>

1144
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:41,169
want to challenge just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit um</font>

1145
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:42,370
what she said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the routing system</font>

1146
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:46,810
and the addressing system are

1147
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:49,240
independent um or decoupled or something

1148
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:51,580
like that right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think that was</font>

1151
00:44:54,370 --> 00:45:00,400
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen enough all right Ted I think</font>

1152
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:02,049
Elaine wanted to make a comment to

today's problem for both of us who are

trying to deploy this thing it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

and every six month because rocking

1168
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,570
tables are going too fast then that day

1169
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,310
you will see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interest trying to</font>

1170
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:41,500
solve this problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've been coming</font>

solution scalable routing solution and

1175
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,470
nothing had happened and why nothing had

1176
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:54,010
happened because nobody cares today

1177
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:56,020
because this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem so we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">should wait until the top two or three</font>

00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:04,900
absolutely excellent a clear statement

1181
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:08,000
boldly stated that's what we're looking

1182

lee irresponsible but bold and clear

1183
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,420
sometimes those things go together yeah

1184
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,160
Ted steely from sprint but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

1185
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:17,220
pick on Jason since that seems to be the

00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,069
theme here<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh Jason let's pretend it's</font>

1187
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:22,770
five years from now I just called your

desk I'm the VP of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sales and I asked you</font>

how much can work<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we charge a</font>

1192
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:35,779
more specifics it's a very hard question

1193
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:46,230
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I look at it is there's a</font>

1194
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:49,200
cost associated with scaling the memory

1195

structure in all of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers globally</font>

00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:58,319
or in the region where this route is

<font color="#CCCCCC">my customers wants to da great to me</font>

1199
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:05,309
certainly they're paying me they should

1200
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:06,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to do that but miri advertising</font>

1201
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:08,869
that to the global Internet routing

1202
00:47:06,569 --> 00:47:12,660
table is something altogether different

1203
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:15,690
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how a routing economy</font>

1204
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:18,029
would work because I'm advertising more

1205
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:21,420
specifics to my peers<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I paid them</font>

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my more specifics would they pay me</font>

1207
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:26,970
for their more specifics if somebody is

1208
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:28,680
running bgp with one of my peers and is

1209
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:31,770
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> full routes did somebody pay</font>

1210
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:34,649
them to carry those routes it's not

1211
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:36,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">clear how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all this money would move</font>

1212
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:39,030
around and and if you could actually

1213
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:41,309
charged enough to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1216
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,290
Ted did I did I answer your question

1217
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:55,200
there's no real answer Jason it's really

1218
00:47:53,549 --> 00:47:57,450
a rhetorical hypothetical question

1219
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:58,770
classified however you want but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

1220
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:00,629
a dilemma that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to</font>

1221
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:03,569
face and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to face and</font>

1222
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:05,880
someone's going to sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can sign</font>

1223
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:08,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">a contract done you're gonna have to do</font>

1224
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,530
it the hard cells I do the hard sell is

1225
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:12,210
going to be look this customer wants to

1226
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:14,670
advertise d aggregates to traffic

1227
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:18,089
engineer if we tell them no they're

1228
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:20,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna take their OC 12 over to somebody</font>

1229
00:48:18,089 --> 00:48:20,640
else who will do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly so you will</font>

1230
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:21,660
do it

1231
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,400
because there's revenue on the table

1232
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:25,339
that's the law<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Ted I have a</font>

1233
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:28,440
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you before you go anywhere</font>

1234
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:30,690
what is the probability that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1235
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,650
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a hypothetical cheer when I</font>

1236
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:37,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">SP is willing to deep here another</font>

1237
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:40,109
transit free settlement free carrier

1238
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:41,700
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there d aggregating too much but</font>

1239
00:48:40,109 --> 00:48:45,808
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't before so why would we do it</font>

1240
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:48,359
again yeah what's 4d aggregation 4d

1241
00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:50,910
aggregation now we never<font color="#E5E5E5"> did I mean</font>

1242
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:52,470
Jesus go back to Sean I mean heat

1243
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">freakin he filtered half the damn</font>

1244
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:56,250
internet and then we unfiltered half the

1245
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:57,839
damn internet and everybody else on

1246
00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:00,089
filter half the damn internet nobody got

1247
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:02,099
deep here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so yeah I'm sorry you say</font>

1248
00:49:00,089 --> 00:49:04,890
you've never done it before so why would

1249
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:06,329
you I'm saying that the history will

1250
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:09,210
repeat itself it will it will happen

1251
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:11,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d period i I</font>

1252
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:12,660
guess what I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you</font>

1253
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:14,970
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only way the people are going</font>

1254
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,288
to cough up money to each other is with

1255
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:19,410
a gun to their<font color="#E5E5E5"> head I'm that's how this</font>

1256
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:21,539
industry works right reciprocity yeah

1257
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:22,950
you know so they're gonna have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1258
00:49:21,539 --> 00:49:25,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">credible threats made and carried out</font>

1259
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:27,509
and I'm I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't see that on the</font>

00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:29,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">near-term maybe that's five or ten years</font>

1261
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:31,470
away but right now you know there would

1262
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:32,970
have to be a crisis before people are

1263
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:35,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">willing to take the risk of partitioning</font>

1267
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:44,309
point point is that the optimal<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution</font>

1268
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:47,339
is to get to a crisis and then sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1269
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:49,619
let the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market sort it out and you know</font>

1270
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:51,119
it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficiently do so I that's not</font>

1271
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,710
isn't the same policies that are in

1272
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,029
place for v6 are almost identical the

1273
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:56,430
policies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were in place for thee for</font>

1274
00:49:54,029 --> 00:49:58,470
thou shalt not do this be a bad internet

1275
00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:00,779
citizen and guess what's going to happen

1276
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:03,359
man one of them when there's enough

1277
00:50:00,779 --> 00:50:07,140
money in someone's hand the sales guy

1278
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:08,490
makes his living selling it yeah I mean

1279
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things happen because money I</font>

1280
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:12,000
mean it comes down to there's a problem

1281
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:14,069
needs to be solved money will solve it

1282
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,500
or policy will solve it one or other and

1283
00:50:14,069 --> 00:50:17,730
it's not five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten I think the</font>

traffic engineering I've got mpls right

1309
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:16,569
so we've got all of our mpls tables how

1310
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:17,980
big does it get right if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people who have v6 deployed</font>

1312
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:23,920
we're worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this think again</font>

1313
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:26,590
good in the middle in the back actually

1314
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,540
before you walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> away um have you done</font>

1315
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:30,130
any studies do you know when you're

1316
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:37,540
gonna melt down if the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> trend</font>

1317
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:40,210
continues no yeah so so do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

1318
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:42,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that the problem is is v6 or is it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">question as I hear it the problem is v6</font>

1324
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:57,339
doesn't have scalable routing and some

1325
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:59,200
people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the increase it</font>

1326
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,580
doesn't have different routing before

1327
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,640
does it have scalable routing that's

1328
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:04,870
true right so what will you<font color="#E5E5E5"> never here's</font>

1329
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:08,350
the issue here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue in a nutshell</font>

1330
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:11,109
which is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea that we've v4</font>

1331
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:13,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we do six and the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a v4</font>

1332
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:14,950
to v6 transition not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

1333
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,540
idea but the idea that's sort of

1334
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:19,480
floating out there is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we do</font>

1335
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:22,330
this transition it comes tightly coupled

1336
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:24,310
with it the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that our routing</font>

1337
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:26,160
problems will be solved because<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1338
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:29,470
example we won't let you know a

1339
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,210
enterprises<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-home or whatever it is</font>

1340
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:33,310
a perfectly reasonable thing to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1341
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:35,650
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put off our scalable</font>

1342
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:38,560
routing problem for five or ten years or

1343
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:40,900
until the providers you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> agarran</font>

1344
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,940
until the vendors can't provide

1345
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,910
equipment anymore and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

1346
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:46,770
v6 just like before

1347
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:49,140
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implement air in public policy</font>

1348
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:51,300
2005 one and that's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1349
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:53,430
direction we're heading now italy at

1350
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:56,460
least in<font color="#E5E5E5"> north america i I can't answer</font>

1351
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:59,100
that for right right so that the hammer

1352
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:01,890
party of you know we're gonna destroy<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1353
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:03,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">six you know once and for all I mean but</font>

1354
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:07,109
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this isn't a</font>

1355
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:08,970
hammer party so how bad is v6 it's bad

1356
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:12,030
it's bad you have to understand that

1357
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:15,750
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's it's it's not that</font>

1358
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:18,030
it's not v6 that's the problem well hold

1359
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:20,130
on here i<font color="#E5E5E5"> GEEVE created more addresses</font>

1360
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:23,700
and we haven't figured out how to deal

1361
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:26,100
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them right but where you're single</font>

1362
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,779
v6 is good but all the multihoming<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

1363
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:31,410
problem all the multihoming aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1364
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:34,560
it are bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> i I mean you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact is</font>

1365
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:37,649
multihoming problems of before are the

1366
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:41,070
same oh no I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1367
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:45,510
scale Tony I really do I you know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1368
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:47,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">sit for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me just the size of the of the</font>

1369
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:50,840
address yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what</font>

1370
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:52,950
generates the problem it exacerbates yet

1371
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,950
and the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is right now we have</font>

1372
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:57,120
a working multihoming solution

1373
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:59,220
unfortunately you know when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1374
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:02,009
things like shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> six those aren't real</font>

1375
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:04,109
world workable multihoming slow no

1376
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:05,700
apologist here I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just trying</font>

1377
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:08,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we focus on the right thing</font>

1378
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:10,589
well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess when we say how bad is v6</font>

1379
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:12,330
we mean you no not just how this

1380
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,980
expanding is it just put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on a slide</font>

1381
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:15,930
yeah that's what well yeah I mean let's

1382
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:17,400
let's be clear the real point of having

1383
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:20,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the slides</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was to get you to the</font>

1384
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:23,310
mic it right point taken yeah but given

1385
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:24,690
his original point is very important<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1386
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:26,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what are the problems that we're</font>

1387
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:29,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to solve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think that was</font>

1388
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:31,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">your original question right Johnny yeah</font>

1389
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:32,730
and Tony I focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the right thing not</font>

1390
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:36,480
the wrong thing I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you know</font>

1391
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:37,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">um or maybe you know that maybe the best</font>

1392
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,200
thing we can get out of this I be

1393
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:42,120

<font color="#E5E5E5">that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can kind of agree on are things</font>

1396
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:48,420
attack those and the title of the IAB

1397
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:50,940
workshop is what for me what's the title

1398
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:52,410
of the IAB workshop Oh scalable routing

1399

<font color="#E5E5E5">that it doesn't quite need you know an</font>

1407
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:20,840
before it is an emergency but right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

1408
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:25,100
the way v6 deployments going in

1409
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:27,970
enterprises like next<font color="#E5E5E5"> to nothing you</font>

1410
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:30,620
might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a little thought to</font>

1411
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:33,319
solving some enterprises problems with

1412
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:37,100
v6 with things like renumber and some

1413
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:40,280
things that were punted on so that CIOs

1414
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:42,710
have a reason to deploy it because all

1415
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:45,260
of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vetala T the service providers</font>

1416
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:47,570
can have all these great scalable v6

1417
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:51,740
backbones but if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are no customers</font>

1418
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:52,910
for them running v6 what's the point but

1419
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:54,759
the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know having talked</font>

1420
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:59,480
a lot of enterprises on this very topic

1421
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:02,120
and a lot of CIOs they are remarkably

1422
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:03,830
unconcerned with v6 and as you said

1423
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,750
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 that particularly</font>

1424
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:07,790

1425
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:09,860
problems they do have very few of them

1426
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:12,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">can actually be addressed by v6 the</font>

1427
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:13,670
reason they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go to v6 is when they</font>

1428
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,680
absolutely have no other way of getting

1429
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:17,810
v4 addresses because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have a</font>

priority<font color="#CCCCCC"> list of important problems in</font>

00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:21,410
the enterprise and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:23,210
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> things related to security there</font>

1433
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:25,759
things related to you know identity

management and single sign-on you know

1435
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,000
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all kinds of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that RFID</font>

00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:36,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is so far down the list and I'm not</font>

1439
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:39,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that it's worth trying to solve</font>

1440
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:42,920
some CIO problem in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make v6</font>

1441
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:45,170
attractive<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I mean that's you know</font>

1442
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,990
these six will be adopted when v6 is

1443
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:50,270
intrinsically attractive in its own

1444
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:53,410
right well the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I was trying to</font>

1445
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:55,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">make was that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there in the original</font>

1446
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,140
architecture there was supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1447
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:58,640
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in there that have been</font>

1448
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:01,580
punted on in the league least in my

1449
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:04,640
opinion<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would have been attractive</font>

1450
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:07,279
to see it's darned expensive to renumber

1451
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,040
a v4 network it's darned expensive to

1452
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,810
renumber a net

1453
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:12,150
work it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be done</font>

1454
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:15,110
no matter what things happen things

1455
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:18,120
change you have to renumber networks

1456
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:20,220
attacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that problem is easy going to</font>

1457
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:23,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">really solve a particular problem of a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">CIO today while some of them that they</font>

1459
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:29,310
can they they've all had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to renumber</font>

1460
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:31,950
networks and have seen the problem you

1461
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:34,380
know dancer your issue there re

1462
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:38,009
numbering is really low on the typical

1463
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:39,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">CIO worry list because right now you</font>

1464
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:41,090
know you have certain technologies that

1465
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:44,129
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> widely used in the enterprise like</font>

1466
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:46,010
dhcp<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Microsoft Active Directory which</font>

1467
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:49,100
is tightly tied in with dns dhcp

1468
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:52,610
remembering<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually extremely</font>

1469
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:54,630
extremely small issue for enterprises

1470
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:57,030
and of course the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they're</font>

1471
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:58,410
mostly using<font color="#CCCCCC"> nap i I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-five</font>

1472
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:00,960
percent of enterprise IP address space

1473
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:02,879
is an added so they never<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> re</font>

1474
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">number under any circumstances well if</font>

1475
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,750
that's the way we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay then</font>

1476
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:08,520
that's the argument for v4 there's

1477
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:10,440
enough v4 address space forever well

1478
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,360
which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't believe what I'm saying is</font>

1479
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,450
is that enterprises really like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Matt</font>

1480
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:17,430
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do so Jason wanted to run a</font>

1481
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:19,770
straw poll to get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense of the room</font>

1482
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:21,660
so good yeah so so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is how</font>

1483
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:23,100
many people think<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some point we're</font>

1484
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:25,830
actually going to run out of v4

1485
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:27,509
addresses or it'll be so difficult to

1486
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:29,790
get v4 dresses that will have to go to

1487
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:32,100
v6 or something else<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so how many</font>

1488
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:34,020
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we will run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out so the</font>

1489
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,670
majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you think we're never gonna</font>

1490
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:37,470
run out a fee for addresses or you're

1491
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:39,420
sleeping just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna sleep it's like</font>

1492
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:41,009
raucous in here this conflict there's

1493
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,840
interesting things have this is the nano

1494
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:45,140
inversion of a street fight guys this is

1495
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:49,950
as close<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it gets too fun in this room</font>

1496
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:51,210
seriously I seriously<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so people</font>

1497
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:54,589
who think that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna run out of</font>

1498
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:57,360
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right hands up hands up up up</font>

1499
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:59,400
anybody thinks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay vast majority</font>

1500
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,740
good we're saying so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next question</font>

1501
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,450
was what about in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years in</font>

1502
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:06,689
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years how many people think</font>

1503
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:11,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">we will have run out of unallocated v4</font>

1504
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:13,440
space what sometime within the next I

1505
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:14,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you're asking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong question</font>

1506
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,190
yeah

1507
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:18,640
I think Jeff Houston whose name you

1508
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:22,430
might spell correctly without the o

1509
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:25,730
would ask the question that you will not

1510
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:28,640
be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get v4 space if you're</font>

1511
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:32,779
willing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend the money for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it does i</font>

1512
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:36,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">said unallocated no yeah I think you're</font>

1513
00:59:32,779 --> 00:59:39,859
right Randy I specifically disagreeing

1514
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:43,099
with you ran allocated phrasing very

1515
00:59:39,859 --> 00:59:44,839
good so over there I've been waiting a

1516
00:59:43,099 --> 00:59:47,990
long time I bladder gladder gishian

1517
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:49,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft I have a slight this has</font>

1518
00:59:47,990 --> 00:59:52,189
actually been really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting for me</font>

1519
00:59:49,579 --> 00:59:53,839
i'll be speaking later on about some of

1520
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:56,660
the changes we've made in windows vista

1521
00:59:53,839 --> 01:00:00,920
and i'm curious<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear from the</font>

1522
00:59:56,660 --> 01:00:03,230
panelists you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably know that windows</font>

1523
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:06,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">vista will have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 enabled by default</font>

1524
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:08,289
and that'll be preferred in other words

1525
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:11,599
if you have both the v4 and v6

1526
01:00:08,289 --> 01:00:13,460
connectivity it will prefer v6 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1527
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,369
curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear whether you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1528
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:19,190
has any influence on anything you said

1529
01:00:16,369 --> 01:00:22,240
specifically on the urgency of the

1530
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:26,440
problem from the routing perspective and

1531
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:29,359
secondly also whether as an impact on

1532
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:31,359
what if alternatives you have available

1533
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:35,538
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the alternatives that</font>

1534
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:36,799
sounded interesting to me was sort of

1535
01:00:35,539 --> 01:00:39,319
keeping the address<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mapper</font>

1536
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:41,900
completely changing the protocol which

1537
01:00:39,319 --> 01:00:47,630
has huge implications for everyone who's

1538
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:53,029
you know built software to execute v6 as

1539
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:55,720
it is yep danse<font color="#CCCCCC"> vista v6 by default</font>

1540
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:55,720
matter not

1541
01:00:56,699 --> 01:01:03,670
well since very few people route v6

1542
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:05,859
anywhere it may be on by default but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1543
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:07,599
know IP v4 is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are going to</font>

1544
01:01:05,859 --> 01:01:09,788
be using I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the de facto</font>

1545
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,709
what's happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1546
01:01:09,789 --> 01:01:13,269
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> putting boxes putting</font>

1547
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:15,129
thousands or hundreds of thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1548
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:17,288
boxes out there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> b6</font>

1549
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:19,209
if it was available will really make a

1550
01:01:17,289 --> 01:01:20,650
difference you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know well I guess we'll</font>

1551
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:23,169
have to see but I mean if people<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't</font>

1552
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:24,130
carrying v6 other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the toy</font>

1553
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:26,279
number of routes that are out there

1554
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:29,469
right now I don't see how it can really

1555
01:01:26,279 --> 01:01:30,999
impact that Vaseline well specifically

1556
01:01:29,469 --> 01:01:33,910
the question would be would it actually

1557
01:01:30,999 --> 01:01:36,249
change behavior would in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular and</font>

1558
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:39,459
we have lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of customers in Asia who</font>

1559
01:01:36,249 --> 01:01:42,339
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited about actually having v6</font>

1560
01:01:39,459 --> 01:01:44,499
available such that you know it's not an

1561
01:01:42,339 --> 01:01:47,229
extra download that their customers have

1562
01:01:44,499 --> 01:01:50,319
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> after yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the point that</font>

1563
01:01:47,229 --> 01:01:52,689
that Dave is trying to make is it really

1564
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:54,729
depends how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of these hosts are</font>

1565
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:58,170
connected to networks that are v6

1566
01:01:54,729 --> 01:02:00,939
enabled and I don't think the fact that

1567
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:03,759
Vista or any other operating system is

1568
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:05,949
operating with v6 in default mode is

1569
01:02:03,759 --> 01:02:11,469
going to change how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many networks are</font>

1570
01:02:05,949 --> 01:02:13,989
connected via v6 now well count<font color="#CCCCCC"> ur</font>

1571
01:02:11,469 --> 01:02:16,150
arguments<font color="#E5E5E5"> dice I'm I really am asking</font>

1572
01:02:13,989 --> 01:02:19,900
your opinion but I think for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance</font>

1573
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:23,769
having a tcp/ip stack native in Windows

1574
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:27,279
95 had a huge impact on demand for ipv4

1575
01:02:23,769 --> 01:02:28,598
connectivity several<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago when the</font>

1576
01:02:27,279 --> 01:02:30,910
internet was just getting stuff so I'm

1577
01:02:28,599 --> 01:02:33,729
just curious you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually think you will</font>

1578
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:36,670
have no impact yeah moderate impact a

1579
01:02:33,729 --> 01:02:39,788
huge impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think unfortunately most</font>

1580
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:41,769
end users don't care as long as they can

1581
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:44,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">open up their web browser and click on</font>

1582
01:02:41,769 --> 01:02:46,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft calm and they can get there</font>

1583
01:02:44,109 --> 01:02:48,578
they're happy and they don't know

1584
01:02:46,089 --> 01:02:51,130
whether they're doing v4 or v6 they are

1585
01:02:48,579 --> 01:02:53,049
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to care and I cuz they're going to</font>

1586
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:55,299
have performance problems because it's

1587
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:57,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fail in the connection and your</font>

1588
01:02:55,299 --> 01:02:58,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">knock circle so so there's there's</font>

1589
01:02:57,489 --> 01:03:01,359
actually an interesting point that

1590
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:04,839
Randy's bringing up and that is if you

1591
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:07,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a Vista box that's on a v6 enabled</font>

1592
01:03:04,839 --> 01:03:09,330
network and is connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font>

1593
01:03:07,569 --> 01:03:12,220
only via v4

1594
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:14,470
but because the pc thinks that there's a

1595
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:17,799
v6 internet available and it defaults to

1596
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:19,450
v6 it may actually look like performance

1597
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">is worse because it's going to try and</font>

1598
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:24,399
do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns lookup over v6 you wait for</font>

1599
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:26,470
that to<font color="#CCCCCC"> timeout right now our thoughts a</font>

1600
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,880
little bit about that later and the

1601
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:29,319
problem with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is people are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1602
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:30,880
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font>

1603
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,800
what's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's exactly</font>

1604
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,210
the case is that enterprise network

1605
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,920
managers not not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end users the end</font>

1606
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:38,740
users are pretty not going to care that

1607
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,730
much but the enterprise network managers

1608
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:41,799
the first thing they're going to do when

1609
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:43,600
they get vist in the door and they use

1610
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:46,420
the tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you guys provide to do a</font>

1611
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:48,069
a site-specific build for themselves to

1612
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:50,560
roll it out they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn off</font>

1613
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:52,450
ipv6 until they decide they're going to

1614
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,560
turn it on on an enterprise-wide basis

1615
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:55,299
because remember it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like they're</font>

1616
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,860
going in and saying we're going to you

1617
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,960
know in two days we're going to replace

1618
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:00,760
everything in our organization with with

1619
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,800
vista and we want to do our ipv6

1620
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:04,180
transition at the same time they're

1621
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,100
going to turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off if they play so you</font>

1622
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:09,549
also talk a little bit about whether it

1623
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:13,330
changes the alternatives available to in

1624
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:17,230
terms of solving<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routing scalability</font>

1625
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:19,480
problem yeah yeah let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick a staff</font>

1626
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:21,400
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we well this is what I said</font>

1627
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:24,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last instance of this question um</font>

1628
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:26,470
basically there's a lot of research

1629
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:28,870
going on in the in the routing research

1630
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:31,689
community and there's work that people

1631
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:33,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in the IHF but if the</font>

1632
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:35,800
question you're asking is what's the

1633
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:37,930
solution well we don't know we need to

1634
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:40,210
develop that solution and the question

1635
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:42,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's been you know come</font>

1636
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:44,170
up here on several occasions is well

1637
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:47,080
what what is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> timeframe in which we</font>

1638
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:48,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so the fact that we</font>

1639
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:50,920
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a solution in hand right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

1640
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:54,160
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily fatal it could</font>

1641
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:55,390
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on it but there may be you</font>

1642
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,899
know there's a clock running of some

1643
01:04:55,390 --> 01:05:00,100
variety so hold on before we get our

1644
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:03,340
another question I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1645
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:05,560
one other point if Vista brings new

1646
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:07,270
functionality to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end user it will</font>

1647
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:09,730
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a big difference if</font>

1648
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:12,040
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room thought shim 6 was</font>

1649
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:14,260
great and actually solves a problem and

1650
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:16,779
you go and you implement shim<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 in the</font>

1651
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:19,810
stack and people use it will absolutely

1652
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:20,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">make a difference now do I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe shim</font>

1653
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:23,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">6 is the answer</font>

1654
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:25,560
not for me do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll make a</font>

1655
01:05:23,609 --> 01:05:29,578
difference maybe in peer-to-peer

1656
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:30,869
networking I don't know but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think if</font>

1657
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:33,780
you're bringing new functionality to the

1658
01:05:30,869 --> 01:05:35,599
stack that's not there in v4 absolutely

1659
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:40,440
I just I just don't see it today though

1660
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:43,050
right just a comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> on something about</font>

1661
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:46,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">four or five comments ago about sales</font>

1662
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:48,540
people selling d aggregation I think as

1663
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:50,190
long as we as engineers can beat the

1664
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:52,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">sales people to the punch and enforce</font>

1665
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:54,000
that as not being an option then our

1666
01:05:52,349 --> 01:05:56,339
lives would be a lot better<font color="#E5E5E5"> and scalable</font>

1667
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,810
uh I do you know what Lane I just I just

1668
01:05:56,339 --> 01:06:00,000
have one word for you there's just no

1669
01:05:57,810 --> 01:06:02,910
chance that's going to happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay just</font>

1670
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:08,550
no chance I've been putting it into the

1671
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:11,750
protocols it's there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just no way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1672
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:15,420
can sell that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sell any God</font>

1674
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:22,460
confession to make the beginning of<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

1675
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:26,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">month the ITF will meet in San Diego in</font>

1676
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:28,380
1998 the ITF miss san diego when i was

1677
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:31,290
still silly enough to give a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

1678
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:35,210
to the ITF in order to communicate that

1679
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:39,029
the problem with v6 was routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said I</font>

1680
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:42,500
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I called a bath and which became a</font>

1681
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:46,020
working group which is was discussed

1682
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:48,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing in the context of ipv6 I</font>

1683
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:51,270
did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean for this to be the sole</font>

1684
01:06:48,869 --> 01:06:53,670
problem they were trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve I was</font>

1685
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:56,339
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to get across the point that</font>

1686
01:06:53,670 --> 01:07:01,770
routing is the problem and that

1687
01:06:56,339 --> 01:07:04,740
addressing without routing is death all

1688
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:07,619
more bits does is make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like it's</font>

1689
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:09,839
bigger the problem isn't that they

1690
01:07:07,619 --> 01:07:12,930
aren't working on it the problem isn't

1691
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:15,930
that 36<font color="#E5E5E5"> people aren't working on it</font>

1692
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:19,290
there are two problems the first problem

1693
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:22,078
is the problem statement is poor and

1694
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:24,930
henning I wish you knew something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1695
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:30,990
routing the problem statement is simple

1696
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:33,569
it is scalable and it is scope in other

1697
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:36,379
words so that global state does not

1698
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:39,690
have to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about everything</font>

1699
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:41,850
the second make it getting everybody to

1700
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:44,850
agree on a clear problem statement is

1701
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:48,900
critical the second is that it's a

1702
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:51,920
damned hard problem and people aren't

1703
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:56,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">really focusing thinking about it and</font>

1704
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:59,310
people who talk about endless stuff

1705
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:00,960
we're not really ninety-nine percent of

1706
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:06,930
the population ain't smart enough to

1707
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:09,960
even work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one ah no argument</font>

1708
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:11,339
with any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I did want to when I</font>

1709
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,470
asked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that who asked about the</font>

1710
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:15,540
routing and addressing thing is I wanted

1711
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:17,460
to read something that that Yakov told

1712
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:21,720
me when I at the very<font color="#E5E5E5"> first IETF ever</font>

1713
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:24,089
went to and what he said was routing can

1714
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:25,980
follow topology<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sorry addressing can</font>

1715
01:08:24,089 --> 01:08:28,589
follow to apology or topology can follow

1716
01:08:25,979 --> 01:08:31,589
addressing choose one and you know that

1717
01:08:28,589 --> 01:08:33,059
still remains true today but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have and</font>

1718
01:08:31,589 --> 01:08:35,550
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of the source of all the</font>

1719
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:37,230
problems like as randy said you really

1720
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:38,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't be couple these things completely</font>

1721
01:08:37,229 --> 01:08:40,259
and that's that was the point I wanted

1722
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:44,880
to make earlier when somebody mentioned

1723
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:47,880
that good leo hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Leo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bicknell harrah's</font>

1724
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:49,319
entertainment I'm struck by the grumpy

1725
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,940
old men here because that seems to be

1726
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:54,000
all we have talking and I'm actually

1727
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:55,200
pretty happy about this I have a little

1728
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,270
bit of a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> perspective I think</font>

1729
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:59,189
than most of the people in the room so

1730
01:08:57,270 --> 01:09:01,650
my perspective is way back in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1731
01:08:59,189 --> 01:09:03,719
sent the IETF a big long laundry list of

1732
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:04,889
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we wanted to do and it contained</font>

1733
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,260
depending on your account somewhere

1734
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:09,660
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 to 15 things we wanted</font>

1735
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:11,190
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix when they ran off and I</font>

1736
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:12,689
won't comment on whether I think they

1737
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:14,399
did a good job or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad job but the</font>

1738
01:09:12,689 --> 01:09:16,979
result is they came back and said well

1739
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:19,019
here's two of them fixed and we all

1740
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:20,580
don't like that and I understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> why we</font>

1741
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:23,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and we should press them</font>

1742
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:25,019
to fix the other you know three to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

1743
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:27,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">or however many things need to be fixed</font>

1744
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:30,270
but the reality is what the clock is

1745
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:31,920
ticking<font color="#CCCCCC"> on here isn't the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1746
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:34,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet or any of these other things</font>

1747
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:38,060
the clock is ticking<font color="#CCCCCC"> on US making a</font>

1748
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:41,729
choice between a v6 deployed as is

1749
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:45,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution that admittedly has a short</font>

1750
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:47,218
lifetime overall or getting the other

1751
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:49,319
three to eight to ten thing

1752
01:09:47,219 --> 01:09:50,759
fixed and deploying everything at once

1753
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:54,210
that's what the clock's ticking on

1754
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:57,030
because in the context of this slide v6

1755
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:59,190
actually does stick some things it gives

1756
01:09:57,030 --> 01:10:02,280
us more<font color="#CCCCCC"> addresses that was one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1757
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:04,710
goals that's fixed in terms of the

1758
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:06,869
routing system<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand that there</font>

1759
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:09,479
are many problems with scalable routing

1760
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:11,549
I will suggest that v6 chipped away<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1761
01:10:09,479 --> 01:10:13,260
and it may only be a one percent

1762
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:15,479
solution it may be a five percent

1763
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:18,659
solution I don't know it's certainly not

1764
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:21,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">the entire solution but hopefully from</font>

1765
01:10:18,659 --> 01:10:22,610
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> classful days in our own history</font>

1766
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:24,839
that we've all kind of gone through

1767
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:27,049
we've learned how to allocate blocks

1768
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:31,110
better I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a hope that</font>

1769
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:33,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">in general traffic engineering aside we</font>

1770
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:35,639
can more or less allocate one block to

1771
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:38,460
ejs if we do it right having more

1772
01:10:35,639 --> 01:10:39,749
addresses as a prerequisite to that no

1773
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:42,090
one I've talked to has argued that

1774
01:10:39,749 --> 01:10:44,550
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a belief that the v6</font>

1775
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:48,150
routing table traffic engineering aside

1776
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:49,619
will be smaller than the v4 routing

1777
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:52,049
table for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same number of</font>

1778
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:54,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">participants because we have learned</font>

1779
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:55,800
from our mistakes and I will submit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1780
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:57,300
that's not enough to get us a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

1781
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,999
years down the road it's not a complete

1782
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:03,570
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two areas there</font>

1783
01:10:59,999 --> 01:11:04,978
that v6 has delivered on so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

1784
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:07,590
that we're all asking ourselves is

1785
01:11:04,979 --> 01:11:12,239
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> we jump headlong into v6 take</font>

1786
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:13,920
these two fixes and say a 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 year</font>

1787
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:15,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">lifespan for those two fixes is good</font>

1788
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,719
enough and then we'll do something else

1789
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:20,728
or do we push the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF the vendors and</font>

1790
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,650
all that other stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no we're not</font>

1791
01:11:20,729 --> 01:11:24,329
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll out this v6 thing you're</font>

1792
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:25,558
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix it lock stock and barrel so</font>

1793
01:11:24,329 --> 01:11:28,530
we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred and fifty year</font>

1794
01:11:25,559 --> 01:11:30,869
solution and then we'll roll it out but

1795
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:34,759
both paths forward are in fact paths

1796
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:38,159
forward there is not a non solution here

1797
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:41,010
two questions for you leo do we really

1798
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:44,699
have that long does things change if

1799
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:47,309
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years or five years and the</font>

1800
01:11:44,699 --> 01:11:49,919
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is you said there was a</font>

1801
01:11:47,309 --> 01:11:53,119
laundry list of six or<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight things is</font>

1802
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:56,059
there one or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

1803
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:59,089
for that problems that we should solve

1804
01:11:56,059 --> 01:12:03,139
now and how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these problems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1805
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:05,479
wait 15 20 30 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think certainly</font>

1806
01:12:03,139 --> 01:12:08,749
and I hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say this I agree with</font>

1807
01:12:05,479 --> 01:12:11,749
Randy the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is the routing</font>

1808
01:12:08,749 --> 01:12:15,260
system and its overall scalability

1809
01:12:11,749 --> 01:12:18,829
irrespective<font color="#CCCCCC"> of v4 v6v 37 or whatever it</font>

1810
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:20,510
may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real problem and</font>

1811
01:12:18,829 --> 01:12:22,728
he is<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct the number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1812
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:24,619
qualified to work on it and probably be

1813
01:12:22,729 --> 01:12:28,219
counted on a you know both hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1814
01:12:24,619 --> 01:12:31,009
maybe your toes as well I think that

1815
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:34,729
problem deserves lots of research and

1816
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:36,499
funding and effort and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1817
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:39,050
really nice if we could solve that

1818
01:12:36,499 --> 01:12:42,260
before we ran out of v4 addresses so we

1819
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:43,760
could deploy it before v6 pragmatically

1820
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:46,219
I don't think it's going to happen I

1821
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,800
think we will run<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of v4 addresses</font>

1822
01:12:46,219 --> 01:12:50,510
and thus we will be forced to deploy v6

1823
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,969
whether or not those other problems have

1824
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:56,719
been solved and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what we will get</font>

1825
01:12:52,969 --> 01:13:00,409
is a reasonable lifetime out of v6 we've

1826
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:03,349
gotten give or take 30 years out of v4

1827
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:06,438
from original conception to now right I

1828
01:13:03,349 --> 01:13:09,289
think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably get 30 years out</font>

1829
01:13:06,439 --> 01:13:12,110
of v6 with the more or less current

1830
01:13:09,289 --> 01:13:15,469
system if we can limit<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to mostly one</font>

1831
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:17,209
block per a s if the providers can limit

1832
01:13:15,469 --> 01:13:20,449
it so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> D aggregate all the way</font>

1833
01:13:17,209 --> 01:13:22,639
down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the / 128 I think we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get 30</font>

1834
01:13:20,449 --> 01:13:24,648
years out of it and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1835
01:13:22,639 --> 01:13:27,349
business perspective that's possibly

1836
01:13:24,649 --> 01:13:28,669
acceptable Lou can we take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a straw poll</font>

1837
01:13:27,349 --> 01:13:30,559
how many people in the room would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1838
01:13:28,669 --> 01:13:40,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">willing to only advertise a single block</font>

1839
01:13:30,559 --> 01:13:43,369

1840
01:13:40,369 --> 01:13:44,780
reef or style multihoming or some kind

1841
01:13:43,369 --> 01:13:46,549
of traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> and wondering what do we just</font>

1842
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:48,309
tell deny<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did not suggest that we</font>

1843
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:50,269
could not do traffic engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1844
01:13:48,309 --> 01:13:51,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely believe it will continue</font>

1845
01:13:50,269 --> 01:13:53,719
because it's the only solution

1846
01:13:51,289 --> 01:13:55,849
multihoming by announcing smaller blocks

1847
01:13:53,719 --> 01:13:58,039
and traffic engineering will continue to

1848
01:13:55,849 --> 01:14:00,499
occur there's two important observations

1849
01:13:58,039 --> 01:14:03,139
though i'll pick on Jason because that

1850
01:14:00,499 --> 01:14:06,019
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> theme of the day uunet advertises</font>

1851
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:06,720
a ton of prefixes not for traffic

1852
01:14:06,019 --> 01:14:08,790
engineering

1853
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:11,190
because they got them back when we did

1854
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:13,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">things different and that's not a knock</font>

1855
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:14,790
on them we did things different we gave

1856
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:16,440
out one classy at a time and completely

1857
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:18,350
non aggregate able chunks because it was

1858
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:21,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">just the method of the day right</font>

1859
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:25,110
absolutely a lot of that can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> away if</font>

1860
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:26,280
we do v6 allocations right which whether

01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:27,719
we're doing it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not it's a whole</font>

1863
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:33,300
good enough that won't occur so it can

01:14:30,210 --> 01:14:37,110

with traffic engineering and<font color="#E5E5E5"> D</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the curve for address space is like any</font>

for anything over time it starts off

slow it goes really really steep

possibly exponential and it eventually

1899

levels off you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

shipped with three options for v6

connectivity of native connectivity you

01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:56,590
have six to four and you have Torito and

1925

model for deployment will be v6 capable

this is pushing the this is pushing the

key on the right pane I believe there

1948
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:43,210
are DSL providers who are adept at

1949
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:47,650
getting people to reduce the MSS so I'm

1950
01:17:43,210 --> 01:17:50,290
sure they can turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> off v6 excellent okay</font>

1951
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:52,839
Richard<font color="#CCCCCC"> steenburgen end layer so when</font>

1952
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:55,330
Leo said that we have solved the

1953
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:57,760
allocation problem if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had done that</font>

1954
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:59,500
we would be allocating smarter the issue

1955
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:02,770
right now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have just</font>

1956
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:05,380
quadrupled our IP space sighs and

1957
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:07,600
increased it by however many trillions

1958
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:10,570
and yet we've only increased the

1959
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,700
effective routing availability by eight

1960
01:18:10,570 --> 01:18:15,759
bits and the way that we're handing out

1961
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:18,519
space it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recreate the swamp</font>

1962
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,920
again everyone knows that that's really

1963
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the issue is and there are</font>

1964
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:24,250
reasonable ways to solve this we've

1965
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:25,990
already come up with a packet header

1966
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:28,060
that's reasonable we've already burned

1967
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:30,849
it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ASIC and a lot of cases and that</font>

1968
01:18:28,060 --> 01:18:32,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">can all be solved you know we can</font>

1969
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:32,840
implement with the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware</font>

1970
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:34,970
today

1971
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:36,620
we can implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight plus eight and we</font>

1972
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:38,600
could come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with something reasonable</font>

1973
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:40,160
with a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of intelligence and a</font>

1974
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:42,230
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of thought now before it gets</font>

1975
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:44,090
deployed before we get down to a crunch

1976
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:47,709
and we should be working on that instead

1977
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:51,770
of standing around wasting our time on

1978
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:54,980
whatever this is thank you so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much for</font>

1979
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:56,840
your kind comments Richard come up

1980
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:58,099
thoughts on that yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're actually</font>

1981
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:00,320
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a comment on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the</font>

1982
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:04,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">things we we've come to accept with ipv6</font>

1983
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:05,990
is the idea that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give 64 bits</font>

1984
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:09,650
for a mac address because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that</font>

1985
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:11,719
that auto assignment is is some kind of

1986
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:14,210
a benefit you know or some kind of a

1987
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:16,520
wonderful thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

1988
01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:18,380
history that might have sort of predated

1989
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:20,330
the extremely wide-scale adoption and

1990

1992

enterprise is needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do all kinds of</font>

1993
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:30,080
stuff we may be wasting those 64 bits I

1994
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:32,390
mean you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1995
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:33,710
saying we need to keep using the AP v6

1996
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:36,020
packet header but that doesn't

1997
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:38,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we have to to stay in</font>

1998
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:42,320
love with the idea of wasting 64 bits to

1999
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:43,910
hold a mac address and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing on</font>

2000
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:46,969
that is the cell derives from all of

2001
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:48,230
these I a GF addressing architecture

2002
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:52,100
documents and I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

2003
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:53,769
really anything you know anything

2004
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:56,510
immutable about that i mean i think if

2005
01:19:53,770 --> 01:19:57,560
all of us came along with or somebody

2006
01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:59,750
came along with eight plus eight or

2007
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:01,640
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was shown it</font>

2008
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:03,020
you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be implementable adoptable</font>

2009
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,400
and so forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that could all be</font>

2010
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:07,430
changed I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

2011
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:09,950
strongly that this stuff is law at all

2012
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:12,260
and yet just to channel randy randy says

2013
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:14,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">eight plus eight any sort of locator ID</font>

2014
01:20:12,260 --> 01:20:16,610
splits not going to help at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

2015
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:18,050
the slots in the global routing table

2016
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:19,910
aren't being burned for that reason

2017
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:22,010
they're being burned for traffic engine

2018
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:24,889
sure I mean yeah it'll help<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's not</font>

01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:26,300
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all but it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a panacea yeah sure</font>

2022
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:32,600
Mike didn't address those in the

original<font color="#CCCCCC"> document yeah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean the</font>

2024
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,720
question is can you aggregate routing

<font color="#E5E5E5">group in a way that's useful that allows</font>

you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide the topology but still</font>

2027
01:20:37,870 --> 01:20:41,780
create traffic engineering and and if

2028
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:44,030
you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do you end up with less</font>

2029
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:44,940
state than you do with more specifics so

2030
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:47,750
my reference state plus

2031
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:52,530
it was sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just example sure sure</font>

2034
01:20:54,300 --> 01:21:00,840
bit of traffic engineering well and I'm

2035
01:20:58,050 --> 01:21:03,239
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to agree with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Leo most of our</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">because we're doing traffic engineering</font>

2038

01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:11,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's because we've been handed very</font>

2041
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:16,080
really careful with where they go in

lot of small blocks allocated all over

2044
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:21,210
the place and we can't aggregate them

2045
01:21:19,469 --> 01:21:23,790
because it would mean remembering

2046
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:25,800
everything if we were giving bigger the

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address allocation policy seems a</font>

2054

running long on time so a brief closing

thoughts from left to right my left

2062
01:22:06,199 --> 01:22:13,349
let's see well I I think a lot of us

2063
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:14,879
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of instability in</font>

our thinking about this problem in the

01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:19,980
in this community and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think for my</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">part of trying to solve it I'm really</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hoping we can get something out of this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">workshop and I'm hoping that I can come</font>

2069

<font color="#CCCCCC">at the next nanog but beyond that you</font>

notwithstanding what people think the

date or time of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whenever the</font>

problem at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks are thinking</font>

about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's a good thing so</font>

01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:57,810
to be ipv6 with provider in a pen

2082

2086
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:08,610
solution although I think it's much more

2087
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:11,790
optimal than what we you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know would have</font>

2088
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:13,620
had with something like shim<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6i I think</font>

2089
01:23:11,790 --> 01:23:16,620
we do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay some attention to it</font>

2090
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:19,410
at this point and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know hopefully try</font>

2091
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:20,849
to solve this because I i think if we

2092
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:24,150
kind of fiddle around for another 10

2093
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:25,650
years you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to</font>

2094
01:23:24,150 --> 01:23:27,540
be in a crisis certainly letting things

2095
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:29,549
fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a crisis is one way to solve</font>

2096
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:31,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">this but considering how important the</font>

2097
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:34,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet is to our economy now and in</font>

2098
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:36,269
the future I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it might be a little</font>

2099
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:39,660
irresponsible to let their become a

2100
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:41,660
major crisis before we actually tackle

2101
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:44,880
the problem that may take multiple years

2102
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:47,550
Jason yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardest thing in</font>

2103
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:49,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past couple of years has been</font>

2104
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:52,020
getting people together to agree on

2105
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:54,809
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the problems that we want to</font>

2106
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:56,700
solve and I think what we really need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

2107
01:23:54,810 --> 01:23:59,240
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is get the operators together to</font>

2108
01:23:56,700 --> 01:24:02,309
speak with one voice to clearly state

2109
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:04,590
simply state what are the problems that

2110
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:08,640
need to be solved now with a narrow

2111
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:10,230
scope and take that to the IETF and get

2112
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:14,190
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work on the protocol and give us</font>

2113
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:15,540
a solution in lieu of that everyone

2114
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:17,460
going and beating up their vendors and

2115
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:19,050
saying I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's two three</font>

2116
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:22,080
four or five times bigger than what I

2117
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:24,600
have now and I meet it next year or next

2118
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:26,070
week or whatever it is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright on</font>

2119
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,720
that note we're running late thank you

2120
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:30,620
all for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your participation I hope this</font>

2121
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:30,620
was somehow useful
