nominations which we now have their

216
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,020
complete we're in the process of

receiving program committee nominations

218
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,990
that's still open so as we look ahead at

219
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,880
future meetings it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important</font>

for all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reflect and think</font>

about who you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to represent</font>

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,400
the program committee the nominations

223
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:58,740
are open and voting begins on Monday if

224
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,980
you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the website</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

225
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,959
sure

226
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,420
that you're an eligible voter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

227
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,449
you have your password and ID please do

228
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,760
so before noon tomorrow that's when

229
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:09,899
voting starts and there could be a rush

230
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,810
if you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done all your homework</font>

231
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:17,339
got all your passwords for us to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

232
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:19,768
to respond and see what's wrong then if

233
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:22,079
you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nano web page</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> under the</font>

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,089
here on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> web page certainly be</font>

238
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,010
willing to take questions but I think

239
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,649
Randy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the steering committee would</font>

240
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:36,149
really rather us kind of breeze through

241
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:37,889
some of these so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have</font>

242
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:39,690
questions we can talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at the</font>

243
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:41,190
end of the meeting or you can look at

244
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,490
the material that's out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the website</font>

245
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:48,480
and reflect this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the report from</font>

246
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:50,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">nana 37</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> San Jose the numbers are the</font>

247
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,459
numbers I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest issue in</font>

248
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:55,769
terms of why we see a negative 31,000

249
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:57,810
therefore the total of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting is</font>

250
00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:59,610
that our revenue predictions were a

251
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:02,099
little light we didn't have the kind of

252
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:05,130
attendance that we were hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

253
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:08,579
san jose<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred and five</font>

254
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:10,649
thousand dollars of hotel expenses as

255
00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:13,170
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember from our</font>

256
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:15,149
discussions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> San Jose it took quite a</font>

257
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:18,540
bit to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together the network</font>

258
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:21,029
connections in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the conference center or</font>

259
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:26,269
the and the conference<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are there in</font>

260
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:28,740
it they just balance the way they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did I</font>

261
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:31,230
thought I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you an update on</font>

262
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the FY 06 actuals you can go to the</font>

263
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,529
website again and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

264
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:37,529
predictions were and compare these

265
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:40,980
numbers for yourself but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in general the</font>

266
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:43,649
revenue was for the total year the

267
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,300
revenue was up just a little bit but

268
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:47,790
certainly not where we had hoped<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

269
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,709
would be salary expenses were up a

270
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:52,560
little bit because we had some vacation

271
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:54,949
and other kinds of salary expenses that

272
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,750
we had to pay out<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the year</font>

273
00:12:54,949 --> 00:13:00,990
in our non salary expenses again that's

274
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:03,329
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel contracts are was up</font>

275
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,819
more than we had anticipated but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

276
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:09,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">good news is as everything balanced out</font>

277
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:12,360
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of looking at loss for the year</font>

278
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:15,660
we have a balance of 32,000 in the

279
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,760
account that's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> news but what this</font>

280
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,529
all says and everyone should again look

281
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,329
at these numbers is we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot</font>

282
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:23,820
of wiggle room there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

283
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:26,219
reserve setting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the account to be</font>

284
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:33,600
able to handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> future meetings that</font>

285
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:35,910
don't meet revenue targets as randy said

286
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,060
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> last slide is where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future</font>

287
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:41,730
meetings are and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that</font>

288
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:44,579
we've committed to at merit so that we

289
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:46,740
could get venue<font color="#E5E5E5"> information out earlier</font>

290
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:49,260
so all of you could plan on attending is

291
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:52,230
to you know really work hard on hotel

292
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:55,589
contracts and to get dates out so

293
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:58,730
februari<font color="#E5E5E5"> four through seven is where we</font>

00:13:55,589 --> 00:14:03,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">are going to host</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nana at 39 in toronto</font>

295
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:06,000
very excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the the venue and a a</font>

296
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:08,279
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on in toronto in</font>

297
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">February and Joe ably has done a great</font>

298
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:14,189
job in<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a number of volunteers to</font>

299
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,019
help us work through those issues jun 10

300
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:18,540
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 13th</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not able to</font>

301
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:21,630
announce our host yet and or the

302
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,689
location for sure it did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> work out</font>

303
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:29,040
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to go to Florida as we had hoped</font>

304
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:31,260
at our last meeting I am 95%<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure this</font>

305
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,149
time however Wednesday we're going to

306
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,540
Bellevue Washington I do not have a

307
00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:38,279
signed contract<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a signed agreement</font>

308
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:41,550
with the host but we're really really

309
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:45,390
close I'm much more comfortable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

310
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:50,310
those are the dates October<font color="#CCCCCC"> seventh 17th</font>

311
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:53,699
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 19th actually yeah okay that</font>

312
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">is right here I'm sorry again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our back</font>

313
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:58,709
to back meeting with Erin as Randy

314
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:00,779
indicated we are expecting to go to

315
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:03,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">Albuquerque but I have not signed the</font>

316
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:06,120
hotel contract yet nor has our

317
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,399
colleagues from Erin but where aaron has

318
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,140
the dates up on their website and we'll

319
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,790
be posting<font color="#CCCCCC"> ours here shortly in just a</font>

320
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:18,029
sec so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's my presentation and I</font>

321
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:21,270
guess we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take questions at the end or</font>

322
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:25,520
now well

323
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:30,120
yeah so I have one question on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

324
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:33,140
obviously when you plan meetings far out

325
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> admit further out in advance then</font>

326
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,280
historically we've been able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write I</font>

327
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,280
mean you actually like know where you're

328
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:43,319
going to be more or less in two meetings

329
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:45,150
that gives you you know more leverage on

330
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:49,800
contracts and perhaps better control

331
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:51,650
over costs but how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is it</font>

332
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,910
also an obstacle in terms of

333
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,350
handicapping the numbers for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting</font>

334
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you're trying to project that</font>

335
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:01,260
out to meetings when you're working on

336
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,180
contracts versus you know if you were

337
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,569
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next one I mean</font>

338
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">because obviously projecting the number</font>

339
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,050
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are going to attend a</font>

340
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:13,469
given meeting has historically been

341
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:16,979
fairly hard and I can't imagine that

342
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:20,610
it's any easier now would you like to

343
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:23,010
take my jab tool um no I'm actually

344
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:25,590
asking you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> make your job harder or</font>

345
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:30,180
easier um your trick it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade-off</font>

346
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:33,930
yeah it's easier to have known dates

347
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:36,180
because instead of having to scramble

348
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,609
and work really hard between meetings to

349
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,130
get another venue lined up it's been

350
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,350
really tough working really hard to get

351
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,680
three in a row you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of work</font>

352
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,970
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that part will calm down</font>

353
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's more of a risk for Carol</font>

354
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,650
actually Carol Wadsworth who does a lot

355
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,140
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel negotiating with the</font>

356
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:57,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">contract so she has to be really</font>

357
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,330
creative and worked really hard to get

358
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:02,430
the room blocks and those kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

359
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:05,550
to our advantage so it's easier for me

360
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:07,560
for venues it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more risky</font>

361
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:12,180
and more difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we're signing</font>

362
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:14,810
for hotels that want merit money right

363
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:19,950
now to sign up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for and we're counting on</font>

364
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:22,770
a great attendance so the risk is we've

365
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:25,020
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> dates out there which is easy that's</font>

366
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:27,810
great we've got room blacks committed

367
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:32,879
the risk is if we don't hit those

368
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:36,870
targets yeah exactly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

369
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,510
I sympathize with you but uh yeah I

370
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:42,030
guess it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> making people wear that</font>

371
00:17:39,510 --> 00:18:01,620
that is definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a liability it is</font>

372
00:17:42,030 --> 00:18:02,850
Thank You Joel thanks Betty I'm Steve's

378
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:33,030
there are no black flies no black flies

379

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Toronto is the best city of Midwest</font>

of this continent it really is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how</font>

381

Feldman program committee chair I'll

383
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,750
keep this brief this is pretty much a

384
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,159
rerun of the reports that I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

385
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:52,770
given<font color="#E5E5E5"> before except the numbers have</font>

386
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:55,170
changed as usual all the opinions that I

387
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:57,150
expressed here are mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all the hard</font>

388
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,950
work is done by the other program

389
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:03,510
committee members so we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>

390
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:05,640
them first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a new member on</font>

391
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,470
the program committee Jen<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wexford had to</font>

392
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,400
resign over the summer<font color="#E5E5E5"> because she</font>

393
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:12,230
realized she couldn't be in too many

394
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,760
places at the same time so Nick feemster

395
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:16,670
has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> selected as her replacement so</font>

396
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,110
now he gets to discover<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same thing</font>

397
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:22,320
nick is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a university academic</font>

398
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:24,149
background and adds or keeps that

399
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,960
valuable viewpoint on the program

400
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:29,760
committee the program for this time we

401
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,550
had 32 submissions which is down from

402
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,450
the 37 we had in<font color="#E5E5E5"> San</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jose of those we</font>

403
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:39,060
accepted 19 declined<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 declined another</font>

404
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,640
one because it was incomplete<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

405
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,960
rember<font color="#E5E5E5"> exact by probably no slides and</font>

406
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,250
we had two that were submitted too late

407
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,770
to be considered because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had already</font>

408
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,120
felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> the available time so those also</font>

409
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:52,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">those don't count among ten that were</font>

410
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,699
declined usual areas for improvement

411
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:59,639
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't really changed since last</font>

412
00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:01,020
time so you considered out program

413
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">format this time is a bit different from</font>

414
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the last two we're back to the Sunday</font>

today the Boston one thing we're doing a

420
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:20,550
bit different a really good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font>

421
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:22,860
doing informal box we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

565
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:05,420
this time it was a user who would not

566
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:06,560
change their alias<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and I see Steve</font>

567
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,490
stepping up is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this related to this</font>

568
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:11,480
question okay the last thing and that

569
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:14,570
was curious<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the interaction</font>

570
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,680
between you and Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the charter</font>

571
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,720
amendment it sounds like you're saying

572
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,790
you pass<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the SC Brandi saying</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SD has never gotten it and there</font>

574
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,330
seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will gladly go back and</font>

575
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,880
find my son man I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said the SC</font>

576
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:27,800
specifically said three weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh four</font>

577
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,650
weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago when we were had scheduled to</font>

578
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,260
discuss this three weeks ago asked the

579
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:36,050
mailing list<font color="#CCCCCC"> Committee for all proposed</font>

580
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,450
changes to the AAP they hadn't q they

581
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:40,340
sent the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> irie asked are there any</font>

582
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:43,130

00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:45,530
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob who seems to act as chair most</font>

585
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:49,250
get the chair doesn't get invited to the

586
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:53,150
meetings but that's okay Randy I think

587
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:54,350
there's a reason I think what we're

588
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,880
seeing here is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of the</font>

589
00:28:54,350 --> 00:29:00,949
friction that I was hoping we could

590
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:03,890
eventually get out in the open and get

591
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:05,570
corrected I don't I don't know that this

592
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:09,400
meeting is necessarily the place to have

593
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:12,470
this discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> server points thank you</font>

594
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:16,400
I noticed you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say there were zero</font>

595
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:19,540
warnings in September and it certainly

596
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,190
looked to me from reading the list as if

597
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:24,020
September was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of as bad as i'd seen</font>

598
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:25,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">it in a long time as far as lots and</font>

599
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:28,370
lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people screaming at each other</font>

600
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:30,700
about various things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had more to do</font>

601
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:32,469
with not liking people than with

602
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:35,530
network operations at all and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm I'm</font>

603
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:37,390
wondering in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reasoning and not</font>

604
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:40,690
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> any warnings during that was</font>

605
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:42,670
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email as individual</font>

606
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:44,920
contributors off the list suggesting

607
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:47,200
that perhaps people might look at the

608
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">aep and think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and not warn them</font>

609
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,310
and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that can shape things</font>

610
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:56,860
into you cutting<font color="#E5E5E5"> down on that it's when</font>

611
00:29:54,310 --> 00:30:00,580
you get into a runaway on the list it's

612
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:02,050
a difficult thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into the</font>

613
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,610
year-to-date zero public threat

614
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,200
interventions when we have to go on the

615
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,929
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say this thread is now dead</font>

616
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,540
please stop it that's that's when we've

617
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:13,510
failed in terms of working behind the

618
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:16,149
scenes to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people kind of</font>

619
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,890
calm down and come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to rationality</font>

620
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:20,620
in terms of the discussion on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list</font>

621
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">so a lot of times there's private</font>

622
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,719
discussions that don't necessarily

623
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,730
constitute a warning but constitute a

624
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,610
we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just chat with you about</font>

625
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:32,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">something yeah it just add</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on to that</font>

626
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:35,379
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I've always all</font>

627
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,360
long felt was sort of an inadequacy in

628
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:39,700
the way that we report things which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

629
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,439
that there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is when does</font>

630
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,810
something become a warning and the the

631
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,990
the answer is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's when we say</font>

632
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:49,120
we're warning you as opposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

633
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:52,210
that most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our mail starts out which</font>

634
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:55,540
is G we'd really<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciate it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

635
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:57,160
would look at your<font color="#E5E5E5"> RA you p and conduct</font>

636
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:01,149
yourself blah blah blah blah blah blah

637
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:03,220
right and most of the time that takes

638
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:08,010
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the situation and i'll grant you</font>

639
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:10,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that sep tember was a bad month okay and</font>

640
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:12,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">i sent some stuff out to people</font>

641
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:16,930
privately that said<font color="#E5E5E5"> look you know</font>

642
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:19,030
without my mailing list admin hat on or

643
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:23,080
even with my mailing list admin hat on

644
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:27,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">gee we would really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to be cool</font>

645
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:33,790
right so that often doesn't get counted

646
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:36,100
the the problem is that the previous way

647
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,659
of doing things had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain level of</font>

648
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,129
convenience to it the same way that

649
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:40,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mussolini having the trains run on time</font>

650
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:43,390
did you understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

651
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:44,770
acting unilaterally and in a

652
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,680
heavy-handed fashion is something that

653
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:49,900
we try to avoid even when the the

654
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:54,190
situation really tempts us to do so on a

655
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:59,110
personal level and I think I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

656
00:31:54,190 --> 00:32:01,450
leave it<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that that we would like some</font>

657
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:03,790
some thoughts from anyone in the

658
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:05,770
community who cares to stand up to the

659
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:08,500
microphone and say exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> where they</font>

660
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:10,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we ought to get involved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

661
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:16,150
we're being too laid back about it maybe

662
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:18,809
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> being mean enough about uh sir</font>

663
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:22,540
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you learn from September in</font>

664
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:24,670
September and steve said September was a

665
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:27,428
pretty is this turned on September's not

666
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:30,940
unique so no but September was a pretty

667
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:33,790
noisy month and not unique thank you we

668
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:36,160
have a sep tember last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> too um the I</font>

669
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:38,770
think the general membership on the

670
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:42,820
whole felt September was not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

671
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:45,280
month and I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering as the</font>

672
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:47,620
mailing was committee poor guys and it's

673
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:50,559
all guys unfortunately had the task of

674
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:52,899
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that and what lessons what</font>

675
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,370
would you like different well what would

676
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">you like different nay you p what would</font>

677
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:57,669
you like different processes what did

678
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:59,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">you learn from the members you know</font>

679
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:03,370
lessons<font color="#CCCCCC"> learned from worst month in a</font>

680
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:07,390
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wish I had a good answer to for</font>

681
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:09,639
you to that aside from from personal

682
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:12,400
frustration I don't really have a good

683
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,470
answer for lessons learned from from the

684
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,840
inception of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> male committee we've</font>

685
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:18,760
gone for months that have been almost as

686
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,360
hectic as this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think is this to</font>

687
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:24,220
very quiet months and there's no we've

688
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,649
gone from being a very heavy-handed at

689
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:29,260
first to being very laid back into being

690
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:30,429
kind of middle of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the road now maybe a</font>

691
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,010
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more towards the laid back</font>

692
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:35,350
side as the pendulum swings there is no

693
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:37,750
magic recipe to this list there is no

694
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:39,428
perfect way to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it is</font>

695
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">arguable that we've been too laid-back</font>

696
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:44,679
lately and if the community thinks that

697
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:46,270
we're too laid-back lately by all means

698
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:49,660
step up to the mic and take us to task

699
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:51,610
for that well well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean let's take a</font>

700
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">straw pal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all right i mean i just</font>

that path straw poll of who thinks that

<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's how many people think that</font>

708
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:16,540
the mailing list committee has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

709
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:18,578
doing an effective job at or two or too

710
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:26,739
harsh<font color="#E5E5E5"> too harsh how many people they</font>

711
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:27,940
were too harsh has not been two lakhs<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

712
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:31,418
so a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people aren't raising their</font>

raise your hand please okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> just making</font>

717
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:52,869
sure i get i just wanted to observe in

718
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:56,639
response to you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the issue you</font>

719
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:59,740
know the original straw poll question is

720
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,660
it's my perception that the reasons that

721
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:05,560
the mailing list committee was created

722
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:07,750
for have been addressed right the

723
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,759
original problem was that mailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font>

724
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:12,940
moderation was perceived as arbitrary

725
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,130
and somewhat capricious right and to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

726
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:20,980
extent i mean the evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> is up there</font>

727
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:22,450
right we have one ban it you know out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

728
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,609
the whole year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see a lot of</font>

729
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:30,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">people having major complaints about</font>

730
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:33,700
that ban right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah 3 for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

731
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:37,540
year one for the period um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think in</font>

732
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:39,250
that respect we've succeeded right now

733
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:44,980
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is have we gone too far i</font>

734
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:46,270
suppose but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually addressed on the</font>

735
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:51,450
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the mailing list</font>

736
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:51,450
committee was created to deal with

737
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:04,790
I just have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask because I'm seeing a</font>

738
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:08,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of folks not get engaged in the</font>

739
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:10,850
discussion and I see all the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i</font>

740
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:13,310
also see from sue how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

741
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:15,319
unsubscribing and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people are</font>

742
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:17,570
subscribing so what the total number of

743
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:21,530
the list membership is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many in this</font>

744
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:25,160
room really feel that nanog is the kind

745
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:28,280
of relevant heartbeat important<font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

746
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,859
list that it used to be how many really

747
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:34,640
feel that it's really important that you

748
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:36,500
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have nanog at nana org working</font>

749
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,509
all the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you count on the email</font>

750
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:42,380
coming through raise your hand how many

751
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:45,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's the frequency okay huh one at a</font>

752
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:49,010
time how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people really count on</font>

753
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:52,520
nanog having relevant information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

754
00:36:49,010 --> 00:37:00,920
operator community in it how many see it

755
00:36:52,520 --> 00:37:06,920
being really relevant now now how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

756
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:17,620
people still notice if<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog org isn't</font>

757
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:17,620
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go there</font>

758
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:24,180
so as everybody can probably guess from

759
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:27,450
my having asked the first question I was

760
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:31,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely in the in the camp of being</font>

761
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:34,470
at least surprised at some of laxness of

762
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:36,390
current enforcement but having had the

763
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:39,240
mailing list<font color="#CCCCCC"> committees job I know it is</font>

764
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:42,089
a very difficult one and one of the

765
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,979
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think you know became</font>

766
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:48,119
fairly obvious to me when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

767
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:50,670
committee was that telling people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

768
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,200
know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the big problems the</font>

769
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:54,000
list has is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's so much</font>

770
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,589
shouting<font color="#E5E5E5"> at each other that it's very</font>

771
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to get any you know if somebody</font>

772
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:00,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">does say something useful it gets lost</font>

773
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,009
in the noise but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time I</font>

774
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">think one of the one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the lessons I</font>

775
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:06,420
learned from<font color="#E5E5E5"> being on that committee for</font>

776
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:09,960
a while was that telling people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to shut</font>

777
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:12,180
up isn't enough because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

778
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can do there is you can create you</font>

779
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:17,009
know perhaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> a quiet realist and less</font>

780
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:19,099
irrelevant stuff but that doesn't cause

781
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:24,570
people to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> posting useful stuff and</font>

782
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:26,910
I remember probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight or nine years</font>

783
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:29,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago when I when I first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> joined the list</font>

784
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:32,399
I joined it because things would happen

785
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:33,960
on the network and I'd need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

786
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,880
about them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do my job they would save</font>

787
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,290
me troubleshooting time to know that you

788
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,750
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an outage somewhere and</font>

789
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:43,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why you know that that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

790
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:46,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">seeing whatever I'm seeing and you know</font>

791
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:48,390
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there are you know still see</font>

792
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:49,920
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mostly on individual</font>

793
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:51,450
exchange point operator mailing lists

794
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,450
and so forth and very occasionally on

795
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:57,779
nanog but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think there's there's much</font>

796
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:59,910
less now that's really you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

797
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:03,150
posted that's useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the operation of</font>

798
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:05,730
networks and so I think you know part of

799
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:07,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">the issue is that yeah a lot of the</font>

800
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:09,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">off-topic stuff needs to stop a part of</font>

801
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:10,800
the issue is that you know there need to

802
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:14,930
be people<font color="#E5E5E5"> posting good stuff to it as</font>

803
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,640
well and I'm wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there are some</font>

804
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:19,230
structural changes perhaps making it

805
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:21,900
easier to sort what goes where or

806
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:23,369
something like that that would spur more

807
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,609
of that on or if that's just a lost

808
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:25,609
cause

809
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:37,900
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to fess up the SC um and last</font>

810
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,869
night was san jose that we met somewhere

811
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:45,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">san jose yeah well I'm specifically</font>

812
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:48,079
raised the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the usefulness</font>

813
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:51,980
content and viability of the mailing

814
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">list and raised it with the mailing list</font>

committee and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> program</font>

committee oh thanks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe in part</font>

817
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:05,109
guilty for encouraging the mailing list

818
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:09,049
committee to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more lacks and</font>

819
00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:11,990
also pushed on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the don't jump on people</font>

when they post a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco or juniper or</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Crockett specific question because we</font>

00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:20,960
all use one of those its operations if

00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:23,810
we told people for any particular router

particular X go to that list there is no

specifically also pushed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the how</font>

are trying to do that and everybody's

832
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:50,390
help would be appreciated I for one

833
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:54,859
though I found September annoying my

834
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:58,640
personal criterion is was the noise such

835
00:40:54,859 --> 00:41:00,920
that it prevented good signal and this

836
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,740
did not prevent good signal there were

837
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,079
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> very few good signals being sent so</font>

00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:08,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not personally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

guys did or didn't do

841
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,430
well before before we hand it back to

842
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:18,680
Chris I just like to throw out a

843
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:22,490
personal plea to all of you who are in

844
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:24,379
here who obviously are interested in the

845
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:27,410
the community and in the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font>

846
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:29,960
and such ah one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

847
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:32,810
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed and I'm sure everyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

848
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:36,490
has noticed is this very easy to end up

849
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:39,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">with an 80 or 90 message thread about</font>

850
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:40,970
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is irrelevant and</font>

851
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">off-topic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where the topic of discussion</font>

852
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:49,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">is whether it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> relevant or on topic</font>

853
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:53,360
for the mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I realized that</font>

854
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:58,160
when something annoys you it is very

855
00:41:53,360 --> 00:42:00,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">tempting to jump in there and uh and say</font>

856
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:04,210
you know that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really stupid would</font>

857
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,210
you please not post this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list and</font>

858
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:12,650
just as we on the mailing list committee

859
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:16,009
have tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> restrain that first urge</font>

860
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:17,840
to reach through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> X term and grab</font>

861
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:21,520
somebody by the throat not that I have

862
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:26,480
anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> in particular in mind but I</font>

863
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:29,230
would I would beg everyone's indulgence

864
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:34,220
in thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> twice before you hit reply</font>

865
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:38,420
to something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is off topic</font>

866
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:40,700
or believe is off topic because you're

867
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:43,580
adding to the problem I would like

868
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:48,020
nothing more than to see 80 or 90

869
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:50,650
message long threads about problems with

870
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:53,440
buying problems with Cisco equipment

871
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:55,850
problems with a particular vendors

872
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,330
transmission gear having security holes

873
00:42:55,850 --> 00:43:03,680
in it or what have you it may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

874
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:07,880
perceived as on topic to everybody one

875
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:10,339
of the reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> why we have not gone</font>

876
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:12,680
after discussions about botnets for

877
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,300
instance which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> personally think is</font>

878
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:16,100
wandering pretty far afield but there

879
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:19,490
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who believe that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is on</font>

880
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:21,620
topic but there's stuff that is

881
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:23,450
obviously just so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

882
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,660
nobody agrees that it's on topic and

883
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:27,598
that seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

884
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:29,940
get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest and longest threads on</font>

885
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,010
them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for</font>

886
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:35,670
everybody's assistance in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font>

891
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:50,010
comment was you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to realize that the</font>

892
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,549
mailing list committee people suffer

893
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:56,880
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than anybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to read</font>

894
00:43:53,549 --> 00:44:00,240
the entire mailing list think about that

895
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:12,990
for a minute Rob did you want to talk

896
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:16,950
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cool dude you a proposal</font>

897
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:19,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">on on yeah can you get the original</font>

898
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:19,970
proposal we had up there

899
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:36,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposal was the yeah that one</font>

900
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,370
other people have hot issues because

901
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,640
we're thinking let this go on for half

902
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:53,529
an hour and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then at most and then devote</font>

903
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,900
the last half hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the election</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

904
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:57,400
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that okay with people or do</font>

905
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:06,100
people have other hot topics don't want

906
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:09,820
to run over anybody's dog gosh that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

907
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:11,080
long a you p<font color="#CCCCCC"> edition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess I'll have</font>

908
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:15,610
to take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blame for having written</font>

909
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,900
that as a proposal and I guess the

910
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:20,770
steering committee really brought

911
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:23,230
brought up a really relevant point when

912
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:25,630
they said the this although although

913
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:30,190
there were varying levels of support for

914
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:32,740
the sentiment embodied in it that this

915
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:36,910
sort of proposal that named specific

916
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:38,770
stuff was a good way to get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

917
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:42,640
niggling arguments about whether a

918
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:45,820
particular activity was something that

919
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:48,940
was prohibited by it and the the

920
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:50,860
original<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea was that we didn't want</font>

921
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:52,750
people posting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mailing list and</font>

922
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:58,480
getting a whole bunch of stuff back into

923
00:45:52,750 --> 00:46:01,150
their mailbox of as a result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

924
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:04,720
posted to the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list the problem</font>

925
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:08,920
is Vijay says it does not scale and if

926
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:11,529
you have 150 or 200 or 500 or maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

927
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:14,590
a thousand god forbid people who decide

928
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:18,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">to run vacation or decide to implement</font>

929
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:19,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">tmd a so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the mailing list is going</font>

930
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:21,280
through it now remember this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

931
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,660
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to mailing list this is going</font>

932
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,000
back to the individual poster of the

933
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:28,830
mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a message that goes to</font>

934
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:32,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> list but the result is that</font>

935
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:36,310
you get a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of email back now</font>

936
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:37,960
to date in terms of actual operational

937
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:39,130
issues this hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been much of a</font>

938
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:42,820
problem but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that people</font>

939
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:45,100
complain<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and I tend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to agree that</font>

940
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:46,780
it's an annoying thing for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

941
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,580
that you should just unsubscribe from

942
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:50,020
the list or send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to gmail or</font>

943
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:52,360
something like that when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

944
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:54,880
be in town if your company requires you

945
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:58,240
to send up asian messages or what have

946
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,680
you so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and I would</font>

947
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">invite people to come up to the</font>

948
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,770
microphone with ideas about this we kind

949
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:07,180
of kicked around the idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

950
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:10,780
trimming it down to anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sends</font>

951
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:13,240
an auto respond drop them<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the list</font>

952
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:14,710
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a drop with any kind of</font>

953
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,689
prejudice or anything and Randy's going

954
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:19,090
to correct me on some portion of this

955
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:21,010
and you're welcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come back as soon</font>

956
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:26,650
as as soon as that situation is remedied

957
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:28,810
but you know it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's</font>

958
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:31,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you wonder</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

959
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:34,029
TM da all of a sudden get huge amount of

960
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,920
mindshare will you have twenty percent

961
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:37,000
of the list go on vacation some<font color="#CCCCCC"> August</font>

962
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,830
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then all of a sudden you have this</font>

963
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,900
real so if anybody has ideas about how

964
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:47,140
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address this I'd really welcome</font>

965
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:49,420
hearing them just just a bit history we

966
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:52,660
did discuss this extensively in the San

967
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:56,800
Jose<font color="#E5E5E5"> open meeting um there was agreement</font>

968
00:47:52,660 --> 00:48:00,609
on essentially the philosophy behind

969
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:04,150
this word<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SC does not feel very good</font>

970
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:06,850
about having pushed it back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MLC</font>

971
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:11,560
when the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially agreed on</font>

972
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:14,100
it but the SC fell and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SCC and after</font>

973
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:16,690
some discussion essentially supported it

974
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:19,540
entirely some some people initially

975
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:22,240
everybody eventually but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue is</font>

976
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:24,660
brought up is this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> too specific</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

977
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,180
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get language lawyer attack</font>

978
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:31,210
so just moderate it down stuff and we'd

979
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:34,089
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some what you know TM da or</font>

980
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:36,070
any other autoresponder etc etc the SC

981
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:37,300
really has no problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we were</font>

982
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:41,110
just worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the language lawyer</font>

983
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:47,500

of the charter amendments that is

1078
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:49,100
proposed is a complex one and that is

1079
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:52,070
regarding the overlap of steering

1080
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:54,799
committee<font color="#E5E5E5"> and program committee we have</font>

1081
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:57,050
a significant number of members who are

also on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the program committee so when it</font>

1084
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:05,210
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to choose the program</font>

00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:09,620
committee it turned out to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1086
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:13,010
small number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

1087
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:16,520
there's a three choice proposal on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1088
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:20,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">Charter one choice is overlap is</font>

1089
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:24,020
forbidden second choice is it's open

1090
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:30,370
season third choices i think overlap

1091
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:32,960
cannot be more than two<font color="#CCCCCC"> people okay so</font>

00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:36,799
your opinion there would be interesting

1093
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:38,309
and in fact will be the rule so it's

1094
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,930
whichever of those gets the

1095
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:42,930
vote the rest of the stuffs all pretty

what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> noise from in front and</font>

1152
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:05,609
behind the<font color="#E5E5E5"> winds um is the steering</font>

1153
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,040
committee has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been interesting</font>

1154
00:59:05,609 --> 00:59:11,210
experience because it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

1155
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:15,840
delicate balance in cooperation between

1156
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:18,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the community with an idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of autonomy</font>

1157
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:20,550
and and what happened a couple years

1158
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">back with the evolution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or revolution or</font>

1159
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:29,280
whatever you call it and Merritt has

1160
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:31,740
actually holding rights and data<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

1161
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,930
idea of what nanog is and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

1162
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:35,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of the work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we're</font>

1163
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:38,730
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> thankful to them and it's been a</font>

1164
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:43,649
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting balance in cooperation</font>

1165
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:46,349
and consensus and very delicate and the

1166
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:50,460
process has only hit a couple of speed

1167
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:54,200
bumps<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've survived them I think</font>

1168
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:56,730
Betty especially needs to be thanked for

1169
00:59:54,200 --> 01:00:00,839
having the vision of the cooperation of

1170
00:59:56,730 --> 01:00:05,130
the community I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog represents</font>

1171
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:08,099
and is one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last cultures that</font>

1172
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:12,330
represents the competitor yet

1173
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:14,730
cooperation of the old<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet where we</font>

1174
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:16,410
all have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this thing work even</font>

1175
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:20,400
though our marketing people are stabbing

1176
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:22,649
each other in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1177
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:27,660
relationship with Merritt has also

1178
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:30,660
exemplified that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've had a</font>

1179
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:34,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">very constructive and cooperative good</font>

1180
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:36,960
start to this change in organization

1181
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:37,910
that is the steering committee<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

1182
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wayne announce</font>

1183
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:43,520
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit goes to all those</font>

1184
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:45,349
people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have participated from</font>

1185
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,210
program committee the mailing list

1186
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:50,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">committee steering committee merit and</font>

1187
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:53,329
the community and whoever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you choose I</font>

1188
01:00:50,869 --> 01:00:57,589
think from that candidate list of

1189
01:00:53,329 --> 01:00:58,760
candidates will be really good folk let

1190
01:00:57,589 --> 01:01:02,930
me just speak for two other people

1191
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:04,970
Vincent Hank Hank is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ben operator and</font>

1192
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:07,879
organized<font color="#CCCCCC"> knocks and organized to</font>

1193
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:13,848
engineering teams for a little while and

1194
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:17,240
Vince saw even longer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> both are old</font>

1195
01:01:13,849 --> 01:01:19,640
operations dogs though Vince's recently

1196
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:24,680
sold out to a vendor will forgive him

1197
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:27,319
and everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is kind of spoken for</font>

1198
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:31,118
themselves you can ask questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1199
01:01:27,319 --> 01:01:31,119
candidates you can throw two miles

1200
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:36,430
anybody else want to speak to this issue

1201
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:44,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">Darin we're going to make the party</font>

1202
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:47,839
pardon oh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Jared chose not to</font>

1203
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:52,460
hurry up and he's probably the wisest

1204
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:55,359
one but I'm definitely thanks Jared it

1205
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:55,359
was a pleasure working

1206
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:09,049
and this is the most significant

1207
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:10,760
question to me which is that back to

1208
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:12,260
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mailing list what can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1209
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,030
as a community do to make the mailing

1210
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:16,070
list more useful what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do to make</font>

1211
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:18,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">these meetings more useful are there</font>

1212
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:21,080
other media we should be using like the

1213
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:24,650
wiki is starting to get some some

1214
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:28,480
popularity etc what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we as a</font>

1215
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:31,910
community and what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want from the</font>

01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:36,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">victims that you've put up here on these</font>

1217
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:41,000
various committees to do to make that

1218
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:44,510
out more useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure we were all</font>

1219
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:47,450
both somewhat honest and yet somewhat

1220
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:49,400
disappointed and wistful when almost no

1221
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:51,080
hands went up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question Betty asked</font>

1222
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:56,150
about you know can you live without the

<font color="#CCCCCC">ago the answer would have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font>

1225
01:02:58,190 --> 01:03:11,600
different why do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to change that</font>

01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:13,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">they ran</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hemel that's on the charter</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Charter proposed it's vulnerable</font>

1230

1231
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:27,590
the Charter proposals by the way Dan

Goldin deserves 5 points<font color="#CCCCCC"> for not being</font>

01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:48,109
the program committee see I'm a liar too

1237
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:49,580
so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not vote for me just a sec I'm</font>

1238
01:03:48,109 --> 01:03:57,410
going to have to fish around to find

this Oh was it there which one<font color="#CCCCCC"> ballade</font>

06

1241
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:13,700
men of eligible charter amendments I can

1242
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:16,789
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this and make</font>

1243
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:20,480
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger and still illegible okay</font>

1244
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:22,579
steering committee elections um and the

1245
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:26,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">original one had bootstrap language in</font>

1246
01:04:22,579 --> 01:04:28,130
it etc etc and it's the head Ted words

1247
01:04:26,299 --> 01:04:30,829
in it like to elect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first steering</font>

1249
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:35,150
things are essentially the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1250
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:37,098
than striking out that language and

1251
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:55,190
putting in electronic voting stuff

1252
01:04:37,099 --> 01:05:01,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh-huh somebody's nose psychedelic there</font>

1253
01:04:55,190 --> 01:05:05,000
we go so cleaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the SC election</font>

1254
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:07,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this most of its just process and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">also removal of to elect the first</font>

1256
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:11,209
steering committee so it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> removal</font>

1257
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,250
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> startup stuff no real structural</font>

1258
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:16,279
change that you will care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about I don't</font>

think mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list administrators major</font>

1260
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:22,519
change because it essentially makes it

1261
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:23,779
the same as the program committee both

1264
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:30,618
steering committee but what it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1265
01:05:28,099 --> 01:05:34,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there are two years staggered terms</font>

1266
01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:37,039
and their term limits etc just like the

1267
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:39,140
program committee the only difference

1268
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:41,420
and those are just like the steering

1269
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:44,359
committee except that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the steering</font>

1270
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:46,359
committee is elected where the other two

1271
01:05:44,359 --> 01:05:48,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">are appointed by the steering committee</font>

1272
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:50,269
so it essentially makes them all

1273
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:53,868
parallel takes out all the startup

1274
01:05:50,269 --> 01:05:56,479
language stuff like that puts in term

1275
01:05:53,869 --> 01:06:00,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">limits etc that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to speak to</font>

1276
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:03,369
that at all ran meet your needs yeah we

1277
01:06:00,769 --> 01:06:06,288
tried to do it we tried we really tried

1278
01:06:03,369 --> 01:06:09,589
yes sir

1279
01:06:06,289 --> 01:06:12,349
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gonna say it may make sense</font>

1280
01:06:09,589 --> 01:06:14,150
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to articulate some of the</font>

1281
01:06:12,349 --> 01:06:16,189
motivating points behind that because I

1282
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:22,479
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're motivated by good reasons</font>

1283
01:06:16,189 --> 01:06:26,149
not bad reasons indeed it may make sense

1284
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:27,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">now this is I was trying to prod Randy</font>

1285
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:29,299
to get to the point that he's made

1286
01:06:27,349 --> 01:06:31,069
before that I really agree with and that

1287
01:06:29,299 --> 01:06:34,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">is if there is a light at the end of the</font>

1288
01:06:31,069 --> 01:06:36,109
tunnel a known termination point then it

1289
01:06:34,189 --> 01:06:37,578
may allow people not to get burned out

1290
01:06:36,109 --> 01:06:39,109
knowing that they can survive just for

1291
01:06:37,579 --> 01:06:41,689
three months more just for two months

1292
01:06:39,109 --> 01:06:42,859
more just for one more month and that

1293
01:06:41,689 --> 01:06:45,499
really resonated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me and I think</font>

1294
01:06:42,859 --> 01:06:52,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">this makes a lot of sense they're too</font>

1295
01:06:45,499 --> 01:06:56,868
has to it one is when and in those two

1296
01:06:52,699 --> 01:07:01,999
days he<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to 730 breakfast meetings to</font>

1297
01:06:56,869 --> 01:07:03,380
lunch meetings etc so and much mining we

1298
01:07:01,999 --> 01:07:04,759
get from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mailing list committee that</font>

1299
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:07,099
they get stuck with a breakfast meeting

1300
01:07:04,759 --> 01:07:09,140
by the way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have my sympathies</font>

1301
01:07:07,099 --> 01:07:13,279
except I have a 630 phone call before

1302
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:16,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">the well but anyway um the other half of</font>

1303
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:17,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is that a you know somebody feeling</font>

1304
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:20,779
like they want out knows there's a

1305
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:22,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">natural end of the term and also the</font>

1306
01:07:20,779 --> 01:07:24,409
steering committee that thinks somebody

1307
01:07:22,489 --> 01:07:27,890
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be feeling that way has a natural</font>

1308
01:07:24,409 --> 01:07:30,289
end to their term with no penalty no

1309
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:33,379
foul right so it just makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it clean and</font>

1310
01:07:30,289 --> 01:07:35,299
simple so so both those committees have

1311
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:37,329
just normal terms term limits etc the

1312
01:07:35,299 --> 01:07:41,650
stuff you've come to expect love and

1313
01:07:37,329 --> 01:07:41,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">have too much processed wrapped around</font>

1314
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:49,430
yes existing time served<font color="#CCCCCC"> does count</font>

1315
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:51,500
towards the term limit so for instance

1316
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:53,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the steering committee people those</font>

1317
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,490
people who are reacting this will be

1318
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,290
their last turn if he if they re-elected

1319
01:07:55,490 --> 01:07:58,700
and the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing goes to the mailing</font>

1320
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:02,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">list committee appointed by the steering</font>

1321
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:04,460
committee it's all parallel right and no

1322
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:06,200
you do not get extra time based on the

1323
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:10,790
number of messages you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to read on</font>

1324
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:13,040
the mailing list and then there's this

1325
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:16,600
thing I described earlier which was the

1326
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:20,330
steering committee exclusivity<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

1327
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:23,450
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have three choices prohibit</font>

1328
01:08:20,330 --> 01:08:25,850
overlap entirely limit overlap tomorrow

1329
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:33,979
more than two members or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter</font>

1330
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:36,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">does permit dual membership no I won't</font>

1331
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:41,809
prejudice it anybody want to comment on

1332
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:43,070
any of those it like many things by the

1333
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:47,210
way that the steering committee is done

1334
01:08:43,069 --> 01:08:50,149
we kind of did the minimal we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought we</font>

1335
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:52,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">could do Steve I'm curious to hear how</font>

1336
01:08:50,149 --> 01:08:53,420
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are currently on both the</font>

1337
01:08:52,310 --> 01:08:55,040
steering<font color="#CCCCCC"> committee and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the program</font>

1338
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:59,870
committee feel about the exclusivity

1339
01:08:55,040 --> 01:09:07,640
thing I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in that category Phillip</font>

1340
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:10,750
is hey Jose<font color="#E5E5E5"> an elegant one yeah it's</font>

1341
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:13,400
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> college turn around that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

1342
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:15,170
the of the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them the steering</font>

1343
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:16,299
committee is the more work because

1344
01:09:15,170 --> 01:09:19,100
there's a there's a meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> every other</font>

1345
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:20,089
telephone meeting every two weeks the

1346
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:21,710
steering committee there isn't there's

1347
01:09:20,089 --> 01:09:24,620
two phone calls<font color="#E5E5E5"> just before each meeting</font>

1348
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:26,330
and a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> review of slides and things</font>

1349
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:28,700
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that the pc is definitely</font>

1350
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:30,319
less work<font color="#E5E5E5"> i actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was the one who</font>

1351
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:31,309
proposed that there should be no overlap

1352
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:32,779
between the two of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them because i just</font>

1353
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:34,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the spirit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the original charter</font>

1354
01:09:32,779 --> 01:09:36,830
was such that there should be a division

1355
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:38,240
and I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that made sense and that</font>

1356
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:40,760
was the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> for having for example</font>

1357
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:43,309
the chair of the pc sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> ex officio</font>

1358
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:44,720
on the SC to give that overlap<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

1359
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:46,520
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd particularly need additional</font>

1360
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,500
people to serve on both<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've said before</font>

1361
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:51,500
that i'm quite happy to do both<font color="#E5E5E5"> if i can</font>

1362
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:53,550
be useful but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Chado is</font>

1363
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:56,090
probably better served by just having

1364
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:58,860
having one that's my personal opinion<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1365
01:09:56,090 --> 01:10:00,630
think there are three three or four

1366
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:04,019
people at the moment who are on both

1367
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:07,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">chris is on both</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's two of you you and</font>

1368
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:11,820
Chris<font color="#E5E5E5"> and from a purely personal point</font>

1369
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:13,110
of view I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that although</font>

1370
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:14,610
was it be concerned at first I think

1371
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:15,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's worked out really well having the</font>

1372
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:17,759
two of you on both because you both

1373
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:19,910
could trouble you but valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> work to</font>

1374
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:29,910
both committees so from my point of view

1375
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:33,750
it's not been a problem at all the

1376
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:36,990
problem actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> was first felt</font>

1377
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:44,360
seriously when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the steering committee</font>

1378
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:48,679
had to decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> um God many moons ago a</font>

1379
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:52,349
year ago on the program committee

1380
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:55,470
members who were<font color="#CCCCCC"> also on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the steering</font>

1381
01:10:52,350 --> 01:11:00,060
committee who wished to read up on the

1382
01:10:55,470 --> 01:11:02,310
program committee and what it did was it

1383
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:03,930
left so since they could not<font color="#CCCCCC"> participate</font>

1384
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:05,250
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to see we didn't feel it was</font>

1385
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:08,190
appropriate for them to participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1386
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:09,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">that decision so they had to be</font>

1387
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:13,230
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> left out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

1388
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:17,220
separate mailing list for it and the

1389
01:11:13,230 --> 01:11:20,070
separate pair of phone calls etc and the

1390
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:21,450
problem and and actually we didn't mind

1391
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:23,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all it's fine it's just stupid</font>

1392
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:25,590
process you go through it the problem

1393
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:28,050
was that we were a little worried that

1394
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:31,320
what happened was we ended up with three

1395
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:34,110
people three members of the steering

1396
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:37,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">committee that were not in that duel</font>

1397
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:39,420
position having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a decision for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1398
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:42,000
significant portion of the program

1399
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:45,900
committee and we were worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1400
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:50,510
membership might feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this was too</font>

1401
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:53,879
small<font color="#E5E5E5"> a group making that decision</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1402
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:56,130
since I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speaker felt</font>

1403
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:59,460
comfortable expressing his opinion

1404
01:11:56,130 --> 01:12:03,750
I don't care which of these I can

1405
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:06,540
operate with any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them Daniel yeah a</font>

1406
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:08,159
couple quick points as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well already in</font>

1407
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:09,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Charter there's a line between the</font>

1408
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:11,638
mailing list committee and the steering

1409
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:14,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">committee you can't actually serve on</font>

1410
01:12:11,639 --> 01:12:18,090
both so that division is already there

1411
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:20,549
and and the other value that comes in

1412
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:22,320
when you separate the SC in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC is</font>

1413
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:24,750
there's some value in having the

1414
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:26,070
greatest pool of volunteers possible in

1415
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:27,719
other words<font color="#E5E5E5"> having the greatest number</font>

1416
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:30,120
of people in the community who wish to

1417
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:31,860
participate in the process be able to

1418
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:33,510
participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the process and if we</font>

1419

<font color="#E5E5E5">keep things sort of exclusive between</font>

1420
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:37,350
the SC and the pc that maximizes the

1421
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:39,330
number of volunteers who can actually

1422
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:41,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">participate just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like keeping the</font>

1424
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:49,889
guess i've i've shown what my opinion is

1425
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:51,600
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know how much of the poor</font>

communication over the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mailing list committee in</font>

1428
01:12:53,969 --> 01:12:59,790
this steering committee might be

1429
01:12:55,889 --> 01:13:04,320
ascribed to the lack of overlap because

1430
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:07,409
the only dual membership is actually the

1431
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:10,380
Aaron Aaron whoo the merit

1432
01:13:07,409 --> 01:13:12,750
representative and the merit people

1433
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:20,250
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> Betty in particular or sue</font>

1434
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:23,580
are very careful<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to act strongly so</font>

1435
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:25,920
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had and as I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be none of</font>

1436
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:27,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's due to that could be significant</font>

1437
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,120
don't know we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had great with the</font>

1438
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:31,620
program committee and some of that's due

1439
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,870
to the fact that hey Joe how'd that work

1440
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:35,790
out hey Steve had that worked out one of

1441
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:37,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that the program committee</font>

1442
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:39,900
has is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chair is on an ex-officio</font>

1443
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:43,050
member of the steering<font color="#E5E5E5"> committee there</font>

1444
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:44,879
is since we're standardizing the mailing

1445
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:46,679
list committee term limits<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

1446
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at standardizing the separation</font>

1447
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:51,540
requirement for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> program committee</font>

1448
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:52,980
one suggestion in terms of improving

1449
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:55,199
communication might be to put the chair

1450
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:56,280
of mailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> list committee as an ex</font>

1453

steering committee if that's the

1454

<font color="#CCCCCC">decision that the membership makes to</font>

1455
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:11,119
not have overlap

1456
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:13,940
um oh pardon me my lima stays the same

1457
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:14,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I I would guess that might be</font>

1458
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:17,268
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the steering</font>
