109
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,219
networks have been there since July and

110
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:06,349
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a few minutes and explain</font>

111
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:10,480
how nanog fits into the merit mission

112
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:15,320
and how it is strategic to to merit

113
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:17,960
merit is as you may know is a non-profit

114
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,730
and nonprofits are formed to meet the

115
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">needs of a community that can't be</font>

116
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:26,680
served as well by a for-profit

117
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:30,490
corporation and nanog is one of those

118
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:35,870
communities that that merit serves and

119
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:37,700
so merit is a regional optical network

120
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're about sixty percent optical and</font>

121
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,920
the rest are leased lines we have

122
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,570
connections out through Chicago and

123
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,650
cross the International Bridge into

124
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:51,200
Ontario and into Ohio primarily to serve

125
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:55,789
about 450 research and engineering

126
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:58,670
clients with in Michigan and we provide

127
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:01,010
advanced networking services and the

128
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:04,550
ability to do some experimentation and

129
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:09,020
so forth in the network and many of you

130
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:11,390
may know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> merit has had a somewhat</font>

131
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:15,020
tumultuous past over the last few years

132
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:17,539
and there's been some important

133
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:21,320
decisions by the merit board it's owned

134
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:24,110
by the the public universities of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

135
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,659
state of Michigan to continue merit and

136
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:30,320
to invest in it and to help it<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow a</font>

137
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:35,690
back to be an asset to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michigan and to</font>

138
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:39,290
the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nation overall and part of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that is reenergize our research program</font>

140
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,580
and part of it is just to get the

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:49,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">company so they can serve a wider</font>

142
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:54,349

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:58,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">do in a sense of our mission is to be an</font>

aren't necessarily tied to anyone other

148

than ourselves trying to do what is the

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,810
trying to do nan dog is very important

154
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:31,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that it's community for us it gives</font>

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:33,710
us a national exposure and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also</font>

156
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,020
important because we run a network and

157
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:39,109
so we have a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our engineers</font>

158
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:42,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">here Bert Rossi is on the program</font>

159
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:45,170
committee and it is important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to</font>

160
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,420
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a forum to share information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

161
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,520
better job running<font color="#E5E5E5"> a network as it is</font>

162
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,930
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to have this kind of a forum</font>

163
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,280
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a community where we can</font>

164
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:59,300
exchange ideas and co-op we have

165
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,400
cooperation amongst competitors so so

166
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:05,600
nanog is important is very important to

167
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:08,719

through most of this stuff here and all

183
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,750

185
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:19,990
and so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> very briefly the things that</font>

186
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,580
we are doing strategically within merit

187
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:23,890
and trying to strengthen<font color="#E5E5E5"> is of course we</font>

leveraging the network like most of your

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:08,319
companies we're moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the stack a</font>

203
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,140
bit as that the pure bandwidth itself

204
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,180
becomes more of a commodity providing

closely into that so where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was when we</font>

209
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:27,099
got this up is the we want to work

is this be a valuable valuable community

219
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:57,100

balance you gotta not do anything too

221
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:05,830
stupid and success is assured so with

those guidelines in mind that is my

happening during the air and portion of

451
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:41,400
the week we've got three policy

452
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:43,950
proposals on the table which should be

453
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,710
of interest to everyone in this room one

454
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:48,510
has to do with privacy of information

455
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:52,920
that's displayed in the who is directory

456
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:54,120
by Aaron and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other two can't affect</font>

457
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,010
the way you do your business a little

458
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more directly one has to do with the</font>

459
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:02,730
allocation of private ipv6 micro

460
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:06,660
allocations and the other one has to do

461
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:08,400
with with Aaron collecting if more

462
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:12,120
information regarding routing at a

463
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,980
stations so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the three policy</font>

464
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,189
discussions in addition we're going to

465
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,560
be having a roundtable discussion on

466
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,230
wednesday i believe it is which is going

467
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">to deal with a topic of blacklisting and</font>

468
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:28,260
we've got a nice panel put together to

469
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:32,940
carry on a nice session on that so if

470
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:34,920
you have it register for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

471
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:38,340
can take the time I would encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

472
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:40,080
to do so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> already set up our</font>

473
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,550
registration desk and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

474
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,460
registered you pick up your package

475
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:48,360
there in addition our cyber cafe is open

476
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:50,340
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

477
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">here for the iron meeting you can get</font>

478
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,040
yourself a copy of

479
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:58,689
a new comic book we've put out about

480
00:22:54,040 --> 00:23:00,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron and it's actually if you look</font>

481
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,950
through it you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that this</font>

482
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:06,580
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually more than just a comic book</font>

483
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:08,799
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is is</font>

484
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:14,320
that we've more or less have dedicated

485
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:18,360
it to jon postel we got vent to allow us

486
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:21,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quote from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him from from the RFC and</font>

487
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,928
then we asked Joyce if she would

488
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,389
wouldn't mind writing a little tribute

489
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:27,610
so there's a nice tribute from Joyce in

490
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:30,669
the back of the cover as well in

491
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:33,899
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> also playing at the cybercafe</font>

492
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:36,130
as a movie about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron meetings and so</font>

493
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,809
take your time if you have during<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

494
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:41,140
break or something other and go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead</font>

495
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:42,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and enjoy those so with that I will get</font>

496
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:46,530
out of the way and let the man like<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>
