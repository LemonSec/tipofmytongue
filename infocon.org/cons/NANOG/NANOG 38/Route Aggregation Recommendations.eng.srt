00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:07,830
morning everybody i'm phillip smith<font color="#CCCCCC"> Todd</font>

2
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:10,469
was saying basically this is just a

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,170
short presentation on a document that

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:15,809
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with Rob Evans from</font>

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:18,570
you LCC and mike hughes from leaks and

6
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:21,210
it all really started off from the

7
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,640
Lynx's field experiment to try and

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,260
encourage their membership what Lisa

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">links membership to try and encourage</font>

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,310
themselves to aggregate their

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,750
announcements on to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual exchange</font>

12
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,160
point so while that all failed and

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:37,079
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the right meeting before last</font>

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">we gotta hedge together thought well</font>

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's try and come up with some document</font>

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,309
that started off from the links work and

17
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:48,270
maybe we can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this as a general</font>

18
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:51,959
industry recommendation thing so the

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,969
current draft is pretty much in the ripe

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,879
right and working group final discussion

21
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,460

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,108
the right meeting in Amsterdam I put the

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,430
URL up there I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

25
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,100
to grab the document but I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

26
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,048
encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all to grab it have a read</font>

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,869
of it please give<font color="#E5E5E5"> us feedback and so</font>

28
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,729
forth if there's anything is missing

29
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:16,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything's well that shouldn't be there</font>

30
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:18,600
and so forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd really appreciate it</font>

31
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll just spend a couple of minutes</font>

32
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">going through what the document covers</font>

33
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:26,270
it takes a look at the history of

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,589

isps so in the history part of the

40
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,270
document we basically talked a little

41
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:44,280

this is really not a wonderful idea and

67
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,500
of course I get all the the reasons the

68
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,709
justifications which include writing

70
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,909

course there's plenty of filtering

again the side the police kind of got
