2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:07,770
operations facilities have ever picked

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,870
up a geographical map and looked at your

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,120
area and<font color="#E5E5E5"> said where are the common</font>

00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:16,288
transportation routes that one disaster

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,150
might knock out yeah a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,720
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it there was the fire in the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Baltimore tunnel a couple years ago it</font>

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,650
took out huge amounts of capacity

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,720
because especially as you get more into

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,880
suburban areas there may<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be one</font>

going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to work around it is</font>

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,050
possibly satellite now whether that's

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,820
something you want to promise your users

16
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,980
whether you have an insurer that will

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:47,460
support that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know but these are</font>

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:51,288
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at now let's talk about</font>

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:55,260
voice over IP specifically what breaks

20
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:57,510
well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first thing that will break you</font>

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:02,309
know usually is on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer premises</font>

22
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,709
and that can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> any number of things you</font>

23
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,630
know Howard that they have you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

24
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,750
it an analog phone that plugs into a

25
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:15,090
set-top box is it that they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IP</font>

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:18,049
phone most often before I<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually</font>

27
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,000
threw away our IP phone and there is a

28
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:23,820
guy was working it refused<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put a tftp</font>

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,549
server in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the local machine so every</font>

30
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,960
time there<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't a momentary power</font>

31
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:33,000
outage I lost the default route and the

32
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,570
the IP telephone couldn't get its code

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,689
any longer uh depending on what you're

34
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,860
putting on site or in the neighborhood

35
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:42,720
say if you've got fiber to a

36
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,560
neighborhood and you've got a pedestal

37
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,390
in it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a bad idea to consider if</font>

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,290
you've got the pedestal to put maybe a

39
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">DHCP and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tftp server in there because</font>

40
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you lose neighborhood power</font>

41
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:00,259
everything is down and if they can't get

42
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:04,229
beyond your point you know their<font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

43
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:07,290
pdx is our<font color="#E5E5E5"> another problem one of the</font>

44
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:10,889
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have found is that if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

45
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,819
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to any fair sized enterprise it's</font>

46
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,040
unusual

47
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,619
well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can throw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out all of their</font>

48
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,010
voice equipment chances are for example

49
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,290
they've got a maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a voice messaging</font>

50
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,290
system that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they like and they don't</font>

51
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to throw</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away if you are dealing</font>

52
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,370
with anything in the air safety or

<font color="#E5E5E5">aviation industry they have their own</font>

56
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:40,439
the world sports so basically what you

57
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,079
need to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about is you go</font>

58
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,638
<font color="#E5E5E5">to them and say what do you have here</font>

59
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that won't be scored and</font>

60
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,620
then start thinking about how do you

61
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:53,010
give them a t1 equivalent out of your

62
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,739
premises router and that usually will be

63
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:58,679
adequate is is tell them that's a t1 and

64
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:01,590
they can live with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

65
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,310
to make some<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like a large Rhydian</font>

66
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,989
say message switch or a conferencing

67
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,329
bridge they've spent a lot of money<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

68
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:14,340
you know they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not willing to do</font>

69
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:17,040
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens is how</font>

70
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,750
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> firewall voice over IP and that</font>

71
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,168
depends there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways of peering</font>

72
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:25,709
voice over IP one is it used to ordinary

73
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:28,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp puri and you let the voice sessions</font>

74
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:31,109
keep up with each other if however you

75
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,989
want stateful failover that you might

76
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:36,120
normally do in a net<font color="#CCCCCC"> or a firewall that</font>

77
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:38,609
won't happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you tend to need a session</font>

border controller function which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

79
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:42,780
basically a stateful firewall you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

80
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,478
have more security in it but that's

81
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,030
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it does and it</font>

82
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:51,870
understands sip and<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially can</font>

access sip proxy<font color="#E5E5E5"> there turn out to be a</font>

00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:01,459
switch in there that are other common

86
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:04,699
elements that you contract out for now

87
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:08,519
traditionally your regular telco cub

88
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:10,199
facilities we had the ss7 network and

89
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,879
they got their directory assistance over

90
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,879
that they got their local number

91
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:17,579
portability their 800 look up their 911

92
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,529
all came in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there the chances are</font>

93
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,530
whether you're an enterprise with the

94
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,570
coil manager and

95
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:25,849
don't need local number portability but

96
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:29,389
you need something or if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> bringing</font>

97
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,520
in a soft switch you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ss7</font>

98
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:33,919
connectivity most of the time to that

99
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,380
instead what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party</font>

00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:42,050
so even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have no customers that</font>

102
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,970
have their own voice over IP you still

103
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,970
may need to have one or two session

104
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:49,669
border gateways in your operation center

105

their soft switch and they run their

number portability 800 look up all these

111
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,059
things there are now service bureaus

112
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:11,090
that do these probably cheaper that you

113
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:14,720
can do yourself if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large not a</font>

114
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:17,989
very large facility but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again think</font>

115
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,510
about the failover mechanisms the hazard

116
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:24,470
upstream talk to you and I'm sure by now

117
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:29,120
in a telco sense one system I dealt<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

118
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:32,210
recently was kind of interesting is they

119
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,850
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a company that actually owns a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

120
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,979
large amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the fiber in southwest</font>

121
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,870
and they have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of small telcos</font>

122
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:42,469
that they provide on it but they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

123
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:46,460
thousands of miles of now OC 192 fiber

124
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:48,500
and they sell bandwidth and I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

125
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,419
well how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you communicate your they</font>

126
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,930
are not going to go though with anything

127
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:55,849
like local sip local voice over IP they

128
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,919
bring it to channel banks and only then

129
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,650
then they put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to a sonnet ring and</font>

130
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:04,219
then they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a stub and feed that</font>

131
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:07,640
to the OC 192<font color="#E5E5E5"> network the way they</font>

132
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,710
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect upstream is they have a</font>

133
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,180
central office<font color="#CCCCCC"> which that does nothing</font>

134
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:15,140
but talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their interests change</font>

135
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:18,470
carriers in and at that point you can

136
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:22,300
talk to that switch expects gr 303 which

137
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,710
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> X bell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> core specification for TDM</font>

138
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,690
to your environment so when the people

139
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,870
start bringing that up it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a</font>

140
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:32,930
typical sonnet or ATM interface but

141
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:35,120
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they often have to talk to</font>

142
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:38,600
their up streams is regular telco

143
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,310
equipment it may be a small switch but

144

146
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:49,400
you wind up<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is you may give it</font>

147
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,470
some ds1 Sordi s3's and it understands

148
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:57,679
that and soft which can produce it out

149
00:06:51,470 --> 00:07:03,770
of its media gateway one of the critical

150
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:06,770
things that goes on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well that is</font>

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:09,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">light blue and light blue is that if you</font>

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:12,349
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> architecture of most self</font>

153
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:14,780
switches today they are split into two

154
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,330
basic functions there is the call agent

155
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:20,479
the does the call agent actual call

156
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,370
processing find the trunk so on and then

157
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,130
you'll bunch of media gateways and the

158
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,979
media<font color="#E5E5E5"> gateway depending maybe actually</font>

160
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:32,180
the whole idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a media gateways</font>

161
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,970
programmable and it's got different

162
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,590
interface cards you can have regular TD

163
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,600
unplugging into that you could have

164
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ethernet is going into them so on but</font>

165
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,580
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're essentially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you're</font>

167
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,680
have to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> someplace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligent to</font>

168
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:53,349
find out how to write a call and that's

169
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:56,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the call agent Park what happens is that</font>

170
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:58,490
anyone remember going back to when we

171
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:01,250
had nice fast nice going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit bps</font>

172
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,740
lines and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are bridging and you have</font>

173
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,449
root wars that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root in two different</font>

174
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,760
places because timing reasons would

175
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:09,710
decide hi I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the root of the spanning</font>

176
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,260
tree and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice a no I'm the root</font>

177
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they'd sit there fighting each other</font>

178
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:17,270
that's exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happens now in so</font>

179
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,030
switches is that they typically have

180
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:25,310
redundant call agent boards in a single

181
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:27,320
enclosure but what in general if you try

182
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,780
to get say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two main central</font>

183
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:33,020
offices so I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> put one call agent board</font>

184
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:36,559
in each one this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> often not a good</font>

185
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,689
idea unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example the last time we</font>

186
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,449
did this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everyone involved was</font>

187
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:45,500

188
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:48,649
two mile apart OC 192 facility between

189
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:51,290
the two locations and they had actually

190
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:56,119
and failover strands<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it one of the</font>

191
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:58,670
big mysteries not given out of soft

192
00:08:56,119 --> 00:09:00,649
switches is if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have multiple call</font>

193
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:04,519
agents and the call agents get out of

194
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:07,730
sync you have the whole system thrashing

195
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:10,670
for control the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> several vendors do</font>

196
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:13,519
it is they run essentially the RRP

197
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:15,349
between them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this gets interesting</font>

198
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,509
as well because typically if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

199
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">different sites and children's in town</font>

200
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:22,249
you probably route between them but

201
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:25,220
routing doesn't work if it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

202
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:27,679
the same subnet so you often<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

203
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,889
have layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> one or a layer 2 connectivity</font>

204
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:33,589
between your central offices otherwise

205
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:36,079
you know if they're built into the sauce

206
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:38,240
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> VRP to figure out which call age</font>

208
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,029
and call agent boards in two separate

209
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:46,849
machines you'll typically have one set

210
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:49,339
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RV in each room and then one that</font>

211
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,410
goes between the data centers and one of

212
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:54,499
the hardest things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that turns out in</font>

213
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:57,230
these cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to get below layer 3</font>

214
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:59,209
connectivity because<font color="#CCCCCC"> PGD Abbott's at the</font>

facilities or you may wind up saying no

217
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:07,399
I will accept<font color="#CCCCCC"> the risk of losing one</font>

going completely crazy because it's got

221

unsynchronized call agents is probably

222
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:22,490
higher than losing one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your central</font>

223
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,370
offices so think long and hard of how

224
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,100
your central offices are interconnected

225
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:29,660
unless you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely bulletproof</font>

lines between them essentially set them

up as master slave padule call agents in

gets windy enough out there and with the

sandstorm with it being abrasive then

255

273
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,140
certainly you know can launch the things

274
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:41,199
and since there's somewhat aerodynamic

275
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:46,930
they start floating and when they hit

276
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:48,670
they hit hard you will also obviously to

277
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,260
feed you got your streams coming in but

278
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:54,189
to distribute your customers you need

but I have found with small telcos that

281
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:04,630
want to start dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with video you</font>

and you multitask<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andhra they say what's</font>

284
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:13,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">multicast then the other thing is that</font>

285
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed</font>

286
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:19,250
you get it to the last router before the

287
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:21,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">distribution network or a switch that's</font>

288
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeding into that now typically they've</font>

289
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,130
had someone go in and let's say it's a

290
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,790
diverse area so they set up him or

291
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:31,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever the multicast routing is the</font>

292
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:33,560
whip usually anyone that's close enough

293
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,630
to set that up it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine where the</font>

294
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,180
problem comes in as they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font>

295
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:40,700
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up igmp and they don't know how</font>

296
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:44,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">to set up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a multicast static route in</font>

297
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:46,220
their last hop router so if you get cold

298
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:50,000
did these tend to be the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> places to</font>

299
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,680
look last<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3-4 times that there was</font>

300
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,260
supposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video turn up but we</font>

301
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,300
get called and nothing worked we tell

302
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,970
made it into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router and you said</font>

303
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:01,760
excuse me here's here's the head end

304
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:04,100
this is where your multicast is coming

305
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,050
in these are your interfaces there's

306
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing in between them the router</font>

307
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,550
doesn't know how to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> there it's not</font>

308
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's direct connected as you know</font>

309
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,540
yeah but<font color="#E5E5E5"> these were unicast and you just</font>

310
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,940
plugged it in everything would work

311
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,550
because it's direct an act multicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

312
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:23,300
that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick a group thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has to get</font>

313
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:25,810
igmp and pay SD igmp upstream to ever

314
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:29,540
the multicast routing takes place and

315
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:31,459
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a telco its concept so if</font>

316
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,410
you deal with the telco trying to a

317
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">video one of the first things you want</font>

318
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:38,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">to sit down and be sure they understand</font>

319
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:40,070
the ramifications for multicast just the

320
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,460
same way is if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with an</font>

321
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:45,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">ISP that starting out voice over IP they</font>

322
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:50,380
don't understand typically the

323
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:50,380
reliability requirement for voice

324
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:00,020
another question is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

325
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,359
demand is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's an</font>

326
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:05,240
upstream provider so you have to have

327
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,730
some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of upstream communications pea</font>

328
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,920
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can know okay you've just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> joined</font>

329
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,690
his multicast group or do you have to

330
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">have servers on site well if your</font>

331
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,500
servers on site remember if you've got a

332
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,050
few hundred channels you might want to

333
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:21,830
listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple hours but that is</font>

334
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:23,910
a big disk so you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider those</font>

335
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:26,760
things that be aware on that

336
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:29,160
and the same way is you will have people

337
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to steal service it doesn't</font>

338
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">matter if they put in more equipment to</font>

339
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:41,370
cost them more than subscribing it's not

340
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:44,520
as much fun now one of the questions is

341
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:49,080
how do you know about a disaster well if

342
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:51,510
it's dirty flap if you're on nsp set you

343
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,370
will get early warning but actually

344
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're around here you know this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of your peering contacts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

346
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,900
on if<font color="#E5E5E5"> your start seeing multiple places</font>

347
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:03,660

348
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:06,090

349

350
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:13,230
thinks of heavier TV set or two in and

351
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:19,199
up have one always on CNN and on the

352
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:21,090
weather channel and be sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

normally feed them with cable guess what

put an outside antenna on<font color="#E5E5E5"> them emergency</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">services may call you now one of the</font>

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:38,870
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have happening is it</font>

359
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:42,000
may be that ranging anywhere from a

360
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,920
threatened damn to a fire that's getting

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of control one of the things may</font>

362
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,270
very well be especially you've got a

363
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,310
reasonably hard enough is good idea to

364
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to your fire and EMS people ahead</font>

365
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:57,239
of time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see if you could be a mutual</font>

366
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:59,430
assistance to each other there was a

367
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,020
situation during Katrina where they had

368
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,479
to make one very hard decision on

369
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:07,099
England's of the right one apparently

370
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:10,440
there was one really big inner toll

371
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:14,129
telephone switch office in downtown New

372
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:16,410
Orleans and somewhere else was a chilled

373
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,090
water facility supplying it and as the

374
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,100
waters came up they<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost their chilled</font>

375
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:23,790
water and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> made a conscious decision</font>

376
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:27,270
to pull a fire engine off an active

377
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:29,820
working fire to go over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to feed water to</font>

378
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:32,760
those dvds that if you know if you lose

379
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,730
or upstream and then you also did this

380
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,320
for one of the ISPs that you know if

381
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,639
your show water you can lose

382
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,370
and chilled water gave more and more

383
00:17:38,639 --> 00:17:43,199
popular so it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something we're</font>

384
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,750
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time having a long talk with</font>

385
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,250
the fire department and say you may be

386
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,519
dependent on communications coming

387
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:52,139
through this facility maybe you want to

388
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,360
dispatch them or maybe you just have a

389
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:55,949
booster pump but you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> give us the</font>

390
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind you know they use if they're</font>

391
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,059
drawing water from a river in couple of

392
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">intermediate hops they often have things</font>

393
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:06,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that go on the back of pickup and that</font>

394
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:11,009
may be enough for your purposes another

395
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:13,409
thing that I guess I knew one day when I

396
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:15,269
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if I you know and it's</font>

397
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:18,389
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the distinction of you nerd or a</font>

398
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:20,220
geek or which but whatever it was I was

399
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:23,189
fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-ranking one and development</font>

400
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,710
organization and I just had a nice

<font color="#E5E5E5">window office you know I found out there</font>

402
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,940
was a snowstorm going outside the job

another thing and one of the things we

00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,809
learned out of 9 11 and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

mailing lists but has come out to be a

411

problem that most people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,850
now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York what happened is the</font>

413
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,980
high reliability providers had a week's

414
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:04,830
worth of diesel for their generators in

415
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,389
South Manhattan and you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> hadn't</font>

416
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">made arrangements with police and fire</font>

417
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:10,168
even was blocking they would get

418
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:13,740
shipments in before they were out of

419
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:16,139
fuel but within 24 to 48 hours their

420

generators started quitting anyone know

421
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:26,240
why dust and it turns out this is not as

00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:38,669
Northwest when we had mount st. Helens

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:40,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then I talked a friend who is in an</font>

they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> their completely ring by</font>

this to you the air<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter may cost $15</font>

431
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:55,109
but no one was sparing them

432
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:57,029
and even if you have a local<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire but</font>

433
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:59,699
say in a chemical warehouse or something

434
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:02,759
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting out a lot of soot that</font>

could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to jam your generator so</font>

438
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,809
and also remember if things quit that

may be the reason another thing

00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:38,158
there were some major issues like

469
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:41,668
Houston try to get itself tremendously

470
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:44,039
ready for Rita but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they still wind up</font>

471
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:47,639
with situations where the ambulances

472
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:50,460
couldn't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the hospital and so on</font>

473
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:53,699
they were variously they had no common

474
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,950
frequency or some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things they</font>

475
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,720
need elected the power company all they

476
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,150
had was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to phone them there</font>

477
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,040
was none

478
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,920
else no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one had ever thought of having</font>

479
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,990
it even though the power company itself

480
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,450
has its own radio network put it you

481
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:10,090
know the ideas if you're a hospital if

482
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:12,520
you're in enough if you are in a power

483
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:14,830
company talk to your other critical

484
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,250
infrastructure people and said do you

485
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:21,010
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> private radio for example</font>

486
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:22,810
they often do said good can I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

487
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:26,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">your network for emergency use and they</font>

488
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:28,540
said gee yeah we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power company we</font>

489
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,550
might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power pole tip over and</font>

490
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,780
someone yeah we'd like to be able to get

491
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:34,419
directly through to the emergency room

492
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:39,399
so you know it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> people haven't</font>

493
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:42,270
thought about this now here's one of

494
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,370
your problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> again with telephone is</font>

everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> says 800 numbers what happens</font>

496
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:53,459
if you lose the 800 database nope or if

497
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:56,140
someone's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call you tube it was</font>

Middle East at least to talk to them and

503
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,290
what I heard the way that cuts off was a

504
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,389
little informal situation as the

505

redistribute EG fake but it did solve a

514
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:46,930
problem oh look satellite phones can be

515
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:49,330
useful now there's an interesting

516
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:53,170
landline it's obviously go down cellular

517
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:56,199
may go down<font color="#E5E5E5"> cellular may not and or you</font>

518
00:23:53,170 --> 00:24:02,350
may be in a special category how many

national communication system now it

522
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:17,800
used did anything ever knew anyone

523
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:20,380
remember every calling someone on area

524
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:23,190
code seven-ten I'll bet you haven't

525
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:26,290
because 710 is the unlisted area code

526
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:28,300
that is what you what happens is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

527
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:31,360
forget what the acronym stand for gets

528
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:34,240
is the priority on on landline used to

529
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,820
be that you dialed 710 and you got a

530
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:40,720
prefix code and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> by piss is although</font>

534
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,959
weird signals the switches you have to

00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,820
get these government approved it's not

536

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:20,490
it is there is a pair

570
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:24,989
I understand either there are actually

571
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:28,230
both 809 800 numbers you get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> card that</font>

572
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:30,300
has a access code on a smart card or not

573
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,860
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially what you do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that then</font>

574
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,260
you get put into area code seven-ten

575
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,510
where you are and no matter what load

576
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:39,420
control is present this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mother's Day or</font>

579
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,280
know hospitals can get this to again<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

Emergency Operations Center in Houston

581
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,740
didn't know it existed and that was for

582
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,090
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole county and that has been top</font>

585
00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:03,120
new it used to be for just one wireless

586
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,850
provider and now they've got a couple on

587
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:10,139
it if you get the phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> also it will be</font>

00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:12,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">a secure wireless phone ah the way that</font>

589
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,740
they do it is it one it has regular

590
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,870
priority attention and probably sell

591
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,400
protocols know about is don't block this

593
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:24,290
but apparently what happens is that if

00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:27,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a major out of blood norleans</font>

595
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:31,320
you might have lost your local two or

00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:33,809
three cell towers the WPS phones we're

597
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,428
still getting through because they had

598
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:37,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to priority signal so the other cells</font>

599
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:40,380
started listening for them I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

600
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,120
you'd go up with power or not but I know

601
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,460
they have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on this problem</font>

602
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,070
that may it looks like a regular phone

603
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:50,370
but it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a government crypto</font>

604
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:52,290
with an unclassified encryption unit in

605
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,629
and all those<font color="#CCCCCC"> same size in the other</font>

cell phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're still experimenting</font>

607
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:59,420
with us but these can get issued and I

608
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:01,980
don't know how only<font color="#E5E5E5"> issuance time is</font>

609
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,620
gets I don't think case long at all to

610
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,390
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto once you satisfy some of your</font>

significant communications provider and

612
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:10,230
in particular if any your local

613
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,210
emergency services hospitals would ever

614
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:15,929
go through you even for internet access

615
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:23,010
that's a legitimate requirement there is

616
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:26,130
a a<font color="#E5E5E5"> system called a dms services or DM</font>

00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,669
reason no one has ever explained to me

620
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:39,840
is

624
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:50,730
what this is is it's a open system

625
00:28:48,139 --> 00:28:53,090
essentially its government free code

626
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:55,980
that Mabel can get runs under windows

627

extensible<font color="#E5E5E5"> object-oriented that runs</font>

628
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:02,639
essentially the incident command system

629
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:04,738
which is the standardized procedure of

00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:08,969
oil fire and emergency from local to

631
00:29:04,739 --> 00:29:11,070
national to deal the major event and the

632
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:13,529
systems have gotten very interesting on

633
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:15,989
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have now they were giving them</font>

634
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:19,529
satellites and they still are because

635
00:29:15,989 --> 00:29:22,019
what you can do on now the edema systems

636
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:24,419
they get it up for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the dirty</font>

00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:29,220

<font color="#E5E5E5">idea what this thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do and again if</font>

00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:33,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">your local people haven't heard of</font>

emergency operation system because what

643
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:38,639
will happen is they started out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said</font>

644
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:41,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay here a couple laptops they're</font>

645
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:43,139
projecting the idea and they put up the

646
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:45,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">area of supposedly the immediate</font>

647
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:47,129
contamination with a street map and said

648
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,100
this is where the radiation source<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

649
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:52,230
said okay and then they put all the fire

650
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,359
trucks on<font color="#E5E5E5"> hunt with the fire chief said</font>

651
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:55,470
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

652
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,509
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what are you going to do next</font>

653
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,859
guys and said what do you mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

654
00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:00,570
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a radioactive cloud what are you</font>

655
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:02,779
going to do with it and then they

656
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,529
started hitting some more keys and

657
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:05,639
literally they've been given us

658
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:07,169
requirement give you on getting

659
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:09,959
extensibility the software two weeks

660
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:12,749
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> the event the next thing they did</font>

661
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:16,739
is they pulled in the EPA's toxic cloud

662
00:30:12,749 --> 00:30:18,210
dispersion model and got a lie National

663
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:20,100
Weather Service report and they

664
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:23,399
predicted where the cloud was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

665
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:25,230
go and and then he said oh well yeah but

666
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:27,959
how do we decide where to evacuate

667
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,609
instead gotcha they then did and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

668
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,529
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet went to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the census</font>

669
00:30:29,609 --> 00:30:34,799
and they said what time of day do you

670
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:36,960
want us to assume and they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

671
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,668
let's say it's not so good and a

672
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,919
highlighter all the apartment houses

673
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:42,989
hotels and hospitals in the area<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

674
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:44,909
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> high density housing they said</font>

675
00:30:42,989 --> 00:30:45,650
daytime here your high density office

676
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,570
buildings

677
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:49,670
these are where you need to go to and

678
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:51,649
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they slap the satellite photo on</font>

679
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:53,630
top and said this is where the plume

680
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,950
will get blocked by a hill so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

681
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:58,100
time to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> there or that is a</font>

682
00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:00,290
collection<font color="#CCCCCC"> point they went beyond that</font>

683
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,719
then and said they have essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

684
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:04,460
equivalent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ebay on there except for</font>

685
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,530
emergency services<font color="#CCCCCC"> it started out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

686
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,380
said you know I'm fire department I need

687
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:10,940
more air tanks or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a compressor they now</font>

688
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a system on it where we'll go out</font>

689
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,770
on the internet essentially people much

690
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:17,690
like on ebay bid is say hey I've got an

691
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:20,240
extra compressor truck in a hundred

692
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:22,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">Scott air packs you need them and the</font>

693
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,980
you then look at who's<font color="#CCCCCC"> close to you and</font>

694
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:27,680
get it so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

695
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">is now if you're a local fire department</font>

696
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,400
doesn't know that exists and you're

697
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,320
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get them connected to that</font>

698
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,300
you think you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

699
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting an emergency generator or water</font>

700
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:42,230
pumped from them one hand washes the

701
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:48,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">other in this stuff but again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I very</font>

702
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:51,980
rarely trying to think it was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

703
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:55,340
go or<font color="#CCCCCC"> down a presentation uh for those</font>

704
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:58,490
of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Cisco or uses one a one</font>

705
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:00,709
contact for guests and WPS is Wendy

706
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,810
Garvin or I think if you just call up

707
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:05,390
though the NCS people they'll start you

708
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:06,620
on the process you know it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly</font>

709
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:10,460
it's not a big deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> as no one's ever</font>

710
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:13,189
heard of them this is after what your

711
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:16,520
service level agreement is now when you

712
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:21,650
go triple play what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to start</font>

713
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:24,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about is that is this but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font>

714
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:26,540
put this one someone picks up you know

715
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,889
you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> all dial-up customer how many</font>

716
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:31,040
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> dial custom order am I going to</font>

717
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:34,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">get connected to AOL or whatever but</font>

718
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,860
someone goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the phone well be your</font>

719
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:39,020
average ginger and say there'd better be

720
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,240
dial tone in that phone they pick it up

721
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,830
there's often right and I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

722
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,050
secondly one class of mine I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said is</font>

723
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:48,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">there dial tone in the phone you haven't</font>

724
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:51,290
picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up and he said I'm said well</font>

725
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:53,810
is the light on your refrigerator where

726
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,820
the doors closed and suppose it I know

727
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:57,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said good how do you know</font>

728
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:00,679
Chuck well the light bulb burned out

729
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:03,979
less you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> never replaced it but the</font>

730
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:06,790
reality is dial tone is saying hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

731
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:09,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the phone network I recognize you and</font>

732
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:12,230
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not exactly the level of</font>

733
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:14,719
expectation people of head when they've

734
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:18,200
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs that it's always going to be</font>

735
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:21,020
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this gets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vehicle thing that's</font>

736
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,030
about a hundred forty years ago when

737
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,250
Alexander Graham Bell decided he wanted

738
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:27,670
an order for delivery pizza and had

739
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:30,920
realized he had<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended telephone first</font>

740
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:32,210
but in 140 years the telcos may not have

741
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,010
learned a lot of stuff what they have

742
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:37,490
learned a lot about his emergency

743
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:39,740
restoration sometimes they don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

744
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:42,710
right one of the my all-time favorites

745
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:46,100
was a blacked out of region they had got

746
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:49,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">50,000 years were out of New York is it</font>

747
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,500
was summer and extremely hot and<font color="#CCCCCC"> con had</font>

748
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,090
the power utility yes anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's got</font>

749
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:57,310
their own generators could you shed load

750
00:33:53,090 --> 00:34:00,080
and go on to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own supply and okay uh</font>

751
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:01,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah he also had 48 hours worth a</font>

752
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,030
battery behind that so they figured

753
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:06,950
we'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now at some point or</font>

754
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,810
another though it was still going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

755
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:10,460
was getting end of the 48 hours they

756
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,830
were start the battery that one

757
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,960
generators had died the<font color="#CCCCCC"> batteries were</font>

758
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:17,659
starting to go low and they had loud

759
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,130
alarm bells that went off when this have

760
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:21,319
all they knew just look<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw the</font>

761
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:24,680
transfer switch and get back on utility

762
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:27,410
power however there was no one there to

763
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:29,600
hear the bell and why was that because

764
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:32,389
this was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old bell system everyone</font>

765
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:37,270
in operations was attending a manual a

766
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:37,270
mandatory seminar on high availability

767
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:43,429
so yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean this is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

768
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:45,139
again try to talk to the health of

769
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:49,159
people and again there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more</font>

770
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:52,699
awareness of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> none or a terrorist</font>

771
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:54,469
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I started as biochemist</font>

772
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:56,899
and some of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see with</font>

773
00:34:54,469 --> 00:35:00,339
with chemical plants and transit scare

774
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:02,480
me you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know much more than things like</font>

775
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:05,690
did you taste in point if you've got a

776
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,700
railroad line anywhere near you in world

777
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:09,420
war one when the Germans first attacked

778
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:12,540
with chemical weapons

779
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:15,119
they use 160 tons of chlorine on an

780
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:18,270
8,000 meter front that killed almost

781
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,650
everybody on it cool now there are tank

782
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:22,740
cars the chlorine its water purification

783
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:24,839
it's around everywhere the standard to

784
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:27,180
track our sizes that go around on

785
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:30,808
railroads carrying chlorine are 90 and

786
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:32,129
55 tons what if one do rails or even

787
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:35,010
better what if jurors puts it into a

788
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:37,349
tank round into one of them you've got a

789
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:40,829
mile that may be lethal without

790
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:43,020
protective gear so that's one thing to

791
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:46,109
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know again it may even</font>

792
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:48,000
be in some cases if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you're near</font>

793
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:50,250
a chemical plant you may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit</font>

794
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,250
hazmat gear in the knock it because you

795
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:55,230
may need to just to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out miscs</font>

796
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:58,049
foremost camino for industrial chemicals

797
00:35:55,230 --> 00:36:01,829
aren't that bad and then again<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

798
00:35:58,049 --> 00:36:05,930
unforeseen consequences a a lot of water

799
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:07,859
systems are converting to use

800
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:13,980
chloramines which were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not nearly as</font>

801
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:15,900
talk glory all and that's a nice idea it

802
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,650
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> taste a little better and so on</font>

803
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:21,359
but one thing that nobody thought about

804
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:24,210
chloramines happen to be excellent rust

805
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,130
inhibitors and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was either Tucson or</font>

806
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,829
Phoenix I forget the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> few cities</font>

807
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:32,160
that went into had the ceramic ware

808
00:36:28,829 --> 00:36:34,920
pipes and this city had cast iron which

809
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,848
was held together by the rust and as

810
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,890
soon as they caught a reward

811
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:42,540
purification all the streets<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

812
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:44,129
exploded so when you start saying

813
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:48,299
something for a voice what's your

814
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:49,950
service level agreement for voice well

815
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:51,660
at least where i work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> nortel only</font>

816
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:54,689
we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> carrier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> switches the rule</font>

817
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:57,480
was once up<font color="#E5E5E5"> always up and that is the</font>

818
00:36:54,690 --> 00:37:00,270
telco attitude so if an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP starting</font>

819
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,700
over phone services you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

820
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:04,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">just that you can't reach 911 because</font>

821
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,069
maybe you don't have a 911 service in

822
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:11,940
there and says you can't phone anywhere

823
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:14,460
this is a liability issue there I never

824
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:17,730
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in a house for example that</font>

825
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:20,299
only has<font color="#CCCCCC"> unless it's multi-home voice</font>

826
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:22,880
over IP at least one a cell phone

827
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:25,970
because you know it's like someone's

828
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:27,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">morse code</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or even better than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the army</font>

829
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:30,078
saying about a handgun is you only need

830
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:35,420
a pistol when you need one very very

831
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:39,619
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much so again mission-critical data</font>

00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:43,430
will whose mission is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know some</font>

regional emergency dispatch you may have

you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find out when</font>

837
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:57,740
you get on to get sore WPS find out who

838

else around is on it yours might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

839
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:02,868
but the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you need in your</font>

840
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:04,730
locality build up a people network of

841
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:08,539
the emergency services and do it ahead

842
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:10,789
of time the FBI will help out in this to

843
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:14,240
some extent in that they have now been

844
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:17,180
asked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be consultants on to brief ISPs</font>

845
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,700
ahead of time if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a major attack</font>

846
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:22,940
of some sort on your facilities you know

847
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:26,029
collect so since not all offices have

848
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:27,500
people that know about communications

849
00:38:26,029 --> 00:38:29,000
they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you know where is the</font>

850
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,369
nearest office I mean let's face with

some if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> closest it wait a minute</font>

852
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:37,029

with this TV said in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ah but</font>

00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:49,759
with you in fire service this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is called</font>

858
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:51,710
mutual aid and it's something that for

859
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:53,900
some reason I hp's will call it each

860
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:55,940
other and help each other but they don't

861
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily recognize that the regular</font>

862
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:00,049
emergency services may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

863
00:38:57,619 --> 00:39:01,839
provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of help and again if</font>

864
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:05,089
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> triple play business</font>

865
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:07,940
nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cares if the gaming system</font>

866
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:09,589
goes they're gonna gripe about but if

867
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:12,740
it's something like I'm still for

868
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:15,950
example we have the hospital hospital

869
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:18,529
system on there they use the cable

870
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:22,129
system there for their<font color="#CCCCCC"> medical education</font>

871
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:25,039
medical dispatch I am told that the way

872
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:27,259
that it works out that every so often

873
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:29,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to be sure that civilians don't</font>

874
00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:32,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">watch it you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every half hour</font>

875
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:34,339
you know they show somewhat doing

876
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,259
hemorrhoid surgery or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and</font>

877
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:40,640
scares everyone away and

878
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:44,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">zeppelins are supposed to watch now this</font>

879
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,310
again what is being expected how much

880
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,680
reliability out one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

881
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:51,620
things this is the blast door to

882
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:54,169
cheyenne mountain and they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> i decide</font>

883
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:56,720
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> close they'll keep it inactive</font>

884
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:59,030
there will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a small</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> staff in there for</font>

885
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,720
quite a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically since the</font>

886
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:05,690
Soviets head yes s18 missile a try and

887
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,850
mount was no longer in vulnerable but

888
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:10,880
they didn't a cost-benefit said you know

889
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:12,770
inside this mountain it's cold in<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

890
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,530
and they demonstrated how much they

891
00:40:12,770 --> 00:40:17,509
saved on air conditioning power but they

892
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:19,970
finally decided that now that they've

893
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:21,860
got that what was formerly the Space

894
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:24,410
Command is now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Northern Command and</font>

he has domestic responsibilities they

896
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:29,089
wanted more office space and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

897
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,360
now they've moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the outside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> area</font>

898
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:34,430
at Peterson Air Force<font color="#CCCCCC"> Base but they have</font>

899
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:38,570
a different way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of looking at things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

900
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:41,690
example their idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of backup power this</font>

901
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:43,580
if I'm you see it goes way off into the

902
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:46,630
haze in the distance those are still

903
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:49,400
generators going back for 60 day supply

904
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:51,560
now is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that expect well</font>

905
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,020
how long does some expect you to stay up

906
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,720
and just like it's happened apparently

907
00:40:54,020 --> 00:41:00,410
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were proactive in Manhattan with</font>

how much detail do you have and Mike

unity of a police escorted refill after

a week<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something so those plans were</font>

915
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:19,640
all in place how many of you are in a

<font color="#CCCCCC">situation where you have diesel is if</font>

917
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:25,520
you give them 48 hours a week if there's

918
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:31,370
a major disaster is there some<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that</font>

919
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:33,580
a convoy can get into you there are a

00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:37,250
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> factors that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come into power I</font>

921
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:41,270
one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously if you can come off</font>

922
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:44,300
more than one<font color="#E5E5E5"> substation uh there was</font>

923
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:48,210
one now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I always have</font>

924
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,849
favorite power story was I believe

925
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:52,650
science building at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stanford and a lot</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> places gives it a pop and comments is</font>

927
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:56,550
going on diesels and it is to

928
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:57,930
substitution<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeds it was about as good</font>

929
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,849
as you can get but then about three in

930
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:02,910
the morning once there was some of these

931
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:05,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">great big bang flash lights went out and</font>

00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:08,910
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> running out to the smoke and</font>

933
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:10,890
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the little fragments of beauty</font>

934
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:12,569
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bert meat coming down well it</font>

935
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:15,029
turned out there was a big mechanical

936
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:18,480
power transfer switch among the three of

937
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:20,970
them and a pair of rats set up

938
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,670
housekeeping inside and started<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

939
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:26,129
rats thing when they want lots of little

940
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:28,619
rats and shall<font color="#CCCCCC"> we say there was a dead</font>

941
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:32,070
short and it took out about<font color="#E5E5E5"> three feet</font>

942
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:33,690
of buzz bar not wire rigid copper you

943
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:37,800
know how you're going to get that fixed

944
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:39,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">at three o'clock at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the boarding and son</font>

945
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,770
started complaining because it turned

946
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,509
out what they said we're disconnected

947
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:44,310
from the internet well turned out son

948
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:46,109
was single home to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that site on the</font>

00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:50,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">theory well they put so much backup</font>

950
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:53,009
they'll never be down anyway diesel fuel

951
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:55,650
has got a shelf life there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are several</font>

952
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:57,510
factors most of which is it tends to

953
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:00,630
collect water in the bottom so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

954
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:03,540
to keep turning<font color="#E5E5E5"> it over it's also from</font>

955
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:05,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">my I'm not a mechanical person but but</font>

956
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,230
people told me about generator motors

957
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,240
you really should run them about once a

958
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:11,099
week for 10 minutes be sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bearings</font>

959
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:14,040
are all fine and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the starting battery is</font>

960
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:16,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">OK and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use up some fuel and you</font>

961
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,810
just simply want more fuel deliveries

962
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:21,240
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> so often so you might as well use</font>

963
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:24,210
it up because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it best in the</font>

964
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,979
last two to three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years now we're</font>

965
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:28,260
talking the batteries and air filters

966
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,730
and fencing here's an interesting

967
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,130
question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this is something</font>

968
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:34,490
happened to Katrina and at least one

969
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:37,680
place actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> and thought about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

970
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:41,118
one of the hospitals had its generators

971
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,500
on a mid-level of its parking garage

972
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,359
what they had done though is they put

973
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:47,700
for various reasons and good reasons

974
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:50,910
they put the fuel tanks on the ground of

975
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:54,089
them well the water was<font color="#CCCCCC"> up between the</font>

976
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:57,359
second and third story of there and they

977
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:58,589
still had power to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep up so was it you</font>

978
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:01,210
know it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question of refilling</font>

979
00:43:58,589 --> 00:44:04,450
those tanks is what happens if you

980
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:08,140
sucking on a fuel tank and there's

981
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:10,930
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming in as far as air you have</font>

982
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:13,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">been and here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they actually were smart</font>

983
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:17,140
enough to do what they do on commercial

984
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:20,200
ocean-going oil tankers they ran<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

985
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:23,049
a cooler and they vented the exhaust of

986
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:25,390
the generator back into the fuel tanks

987
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:31,420
which now puts a blank of an inert gas

988
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:33,730
on top of it and also if you do that is

989
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:35,230
if you're you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Minneapolis or</font>

990
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:38,200
something you may need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have diesel</font>

991
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:40,570
tank heaters but if you recirculate the

00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,970
exhaust gets into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it not only does it</font>

993
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:44,380
keep a vacuum forming not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

996
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,810
probably cold climates where we need to

chill<font color="#CCCCCC"> the diesel but those are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ones</font>

00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:19,990
about what happened to World Trade

Center 94 70s was that you know I've

<font color="#CCCCCC">of research going on about how high is</font>

1016
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:44,319
it safe to put even a backup tank also

not put liquid electrolyte batteries

you may have some things as a you may

00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:22,820
the rats you need to figure out is there

1032

think that switch with a you know

elaborately through like that would

1035
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:34,970
break but it did<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now availability</font>

1036
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:38,840
as a mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that is a</font>

1037
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:42,410
relative thing and you have to remember

00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:46,420
the real<font color="#CCCCCC"> experts on rules it's always a</font>

1039
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:46,420
good idea to give a Ferengi in<font color="#E5E5E5"> sales</font>

1040
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:55,670
you've got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference in business</font>

1041
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:59,230
services and commercial and residential

1042
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:01,940
so on what's the parrot availability is

1043
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:06,560
it quota made the visit they ever work

1044
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:11,750
late do you have maintenance windows how

1045
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:14,390
about for voice over IP or<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV not just</font>

1046
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:22,070
the amount of volume is it's got to be

1047
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:24,020
up all the time and when it comes can

1048
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:27,050
you have a way of providing<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources</font>

1049
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:29,650
and is there a situation where if it

1050
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:32,120
you're up links are partially destroyed

1051
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:35,030
let's say you're getting a video feed

1052
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">from someone is it possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if that's</font>

1054
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:41,450
fiber in an emergency situation might

1055
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,120
you preempt that and get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hooked up</font>

1056
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:48,200
to a telephone feed at the other end

1057
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:51,370
it's been done also another thing to

00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:55,040
consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> peace Levario to virginia and</font>

1059
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:57,589
remember that cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> tru TV franchises</font>

1060
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:00,490
are normally on a city or a county basis

00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:02,900
but very<font color="#E5E5E5"> often it may be one company or</font>

1062
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:04,850
just sometimes because of zoning and

1063
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,640
where you put the large satellite dishes

1064
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:10,190
all the headings or near each other so

1065
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,569
even though it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> called for if you</font>

1066
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:13,280
get together with cable providers though

1071
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:27,170
they may even have satellite uplinks no

00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,849
matter what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do though</font>

1073
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:32,000
there are going to be failures in the

1074

local loop of cable or so on and you

1075

know it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes when you call for</font>

help I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that's most</font>

1077
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:43,250
annoyed me about outages on cable is

1078
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:46,460
when they've got you on hold for<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

1079
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:48,260
young 30 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so which is more out</font>

1080
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:51,530
frustrating saying your call is very

1081
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:53,809
important to us or to<font color="#CCCCCC"> their saying if</font>

1082
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:58,040
you go to our self-help site on the web

1083
00:48:53,809 --> 00:49:01,010
I go back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forth I'm usually ready to</font>

1084
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:03,259
kill what I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> found is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1085
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:05,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">in comcast and I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that their second</font>

1086
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:08,569
level center is in Halifax Nova Scotia

1087
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:11,569
so you if you get someone really

1088
00:49:08,569 --> 00:49:13,369
clueless at first local<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for</font>

1089
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:14,839
escalation and then sound Canadian or

1090
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:16,220
say something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> hockey or something</font>

1091
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:20,420
and suddenly they can't do enough for

1092
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:22,669
you but one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you may want</font>

1093
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:24,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">to even for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> home offices this something</font>

1094
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:29,059
I'm very actively considering doing is

1095
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:31,129
that can I get can you is let's say

1096
00:49:29,059 --> 00:49:33,410
you're a cable provider and that's what

1097
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:35,240
you're providing broadband even though

1098
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:38,450
that your competitor can you strike a

1099
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:40,700
deal with a local telco saying that will

1100
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:44,390
you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a bulk discount if we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-home sites on your dsl some nice</font>

1102
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:47,930
deals have been cut and it's kind of

1103
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:50,180
win-win for everybody I mean yeah

1104
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:52,308
Kayla's going to be faster but the thing

1105
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:54,859
is they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> physically diverse media</font>

1106
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:57,020
other than yeah maybe coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the</font>

1107
00:49:54,859 --> 00:49:58,328
building but once you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1108
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:08,180
street they're going to be quite diverse

1109
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:10,579
you hope excuse me that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that again</font>

1110
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:12,680
maybe not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> giant phone company but if</font>

1111
00:50:10,579 --> 00:50:16,280
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going and let's say you are</font>

1112
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:19,609
providing cable broadband you go to your

1113
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:22,220
local business<font color="#E5E5E5"> office of your telco</font>

1114
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:25,220
that's providing dsl and say we

1115
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:29,089
guarantee to buy so much bandwidth s

1116
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:32,029
back up from you will you give us<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cut</font>

1117
00:50:29,089 --> 00:50:33,619
rate on that and they say what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it and</font>

1118
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:35,780
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are sites we've already lost you</font>

1119
00:50:33,619 --> 00:50:39,109
so sure that gives us back a good deal

1120
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:40,400
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> but thing is that if you find the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> merci</font>

1122
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,539
caring enough people if you're a cable

1123
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:47,359
carrier you may get very good telephone

1124
00:50:44,539 --> 00:50:49,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">service rates and vice versa and the way</font>

1125
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,200
to sell it to them is convincing them

1126
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:57,680
that they otherwise would have lost any

1127
00:50:51,200 --> 00:51:01,399
revenue out of it these are the typical

1128
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:04,430
now getting into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the various kinds of</font>

process or<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco 75 hundreds at each</font>

1141
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:44,058
site one is cold the reason they have

1142
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:46,009
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> duo are ESPYs and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything in one</font>

1143
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:48,020
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so they figure that's safe you</font>

1144
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:50,930
don't fail over but the extra one is

1145
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:53,089
they can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike the code or iOS</font>

1146
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:56,149
upgrades on it and they won't do that

1147
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:57,319
and that some tour is eat sometimes what

1148
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,619
you might want to do is even get an

1149
00:51:57,319 --> 00:52:02,329
older cheaper unit and keep it there lot

1150
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:05,029
of telco central offices are triple

1151
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:07,369
processor for that reason one is active

1152
00:52:05,029 --> 00:52:09,289
what is hot standby one is the one you

1153
00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:11,180
do maintenance upgrades when do the

1154
00:52:09,289 --> 00:52:13,549
maintenance upgrades you<font color="#CCCCCC"> then swap that</font>

1155
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:16,819
that with a hot standby so you're never

1156
00:52:13,549 --> 00:52:19,190
down and we usually think in terms of

1157
00:52:16,819 --> 00:52:25,730
two devices but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot to be said</font>

1158
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:29,150
about three I like my back hope

1159
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:30,890
animation again we've gone over a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1160
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:35,150
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things but again is there a single</font>

1161
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:38,180
medium failure ah are there things you

1162
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:39,680
can't do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about yes and you may</font>

1163
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:42,109
if there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> times you need business</font>

1164
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,440
insurance there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was at one was then</font>

1165
00:52:42,109 --> 00:52:48,380
bowing computer services but the pace

1166
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,410
had moved at that point but somebody was

1167
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:52,809
trenching in his great new

1168
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:55,270
that was going to lay new fiber for

1169
00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:58,720
something and drilled into their duck

1170
00:52:55,270 --> 00:53:00,579
and not only though it blew fiber into

1171
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:05,680
it crashing into it was there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1172
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:07,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">it pumped concrete behind it now I think</font>

1173
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:09,578
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us tend to forget about sub IP</font>

1174
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:14,650
technologies and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful</font>

1175
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:18,099
there is still a role for layer to one

1176
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:20,710
of our clients is there is my over

1177

<font color="#CCCCCC">client has got to datacenter as I</font>

1178
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:24,670
mentioned there there the Midwest<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1179
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:28,149
about 20 miles apart they have plenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:30,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">dark fiber between the two one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1181
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:33,039
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they are basically there are</font>

1182
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,780
specialized hosting services it's some

1183
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:37,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">of his application that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't really</font>

1184
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:40,119
understand but they said hey it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1185
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:43,720
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can essentially single</font>

1186
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:45,400
transaction failover no problem so we

1187
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,618
can totally do we have duplicate IP

1188
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,869
servers so what they give but we need

1189
00:53:47,619 --> 00:53:52,510
for them is we set the two sites and

1190
00:53:49,869 --> 00:53:55,240
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had 75 hundreds coming in with</font>

1191
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:57,210
twitter and ISPs and we then ran that

1192
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:59,649
over to the other side over there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50</font>

1193
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:02,890
but then what we get is we put a layer

1194
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:05,920
34 37 fifties in between running

1195
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:09,009
spanning tree between the two sides and

1196
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:12,339
we put duplicate IP addresses on the

1197
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:13,900
servers at each side well as long as one

1198
00:54:12,339 --> 00:54:16,720
was up and the rope was over on that

1199
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:18,460
side it went to those IP addresses but

1200
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">as soon as they lost layer to</font>

1201
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:22,180
connectivity they would automatically

1202
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:25,539
fail over to the other ones with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1203
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:28,149
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP addresses we also had DNS on any</font>

1204
00:54:25,539 --> 00:54:30,910
cast so turned out that with a way they

1205
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:33,910
were really hard to handle with routing

1206
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:36,129
with j'ellooo you know now i will say

1207
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:38,049
that on all of these servers we are dual

1208
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:39,910
nics we had the one phil goes to the

1209
00:54:38,049 --> 00:54:42,788
customer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they can have unique</font>

1210
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:46,629
internal addresses for maintenance but

1211
00:54:42,789 --> 00:54:49,599
that worked out real well even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1212
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:51,940
are have IP and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing service</font>

1213
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:55,029
provision consider private vlans<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1214
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:58,029
security and again if you do something

1215
00:54:55,029 --> 00:55:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that call agent case you are like</font>

1216
00:54:58,029 --> 00:55:04,240
if you have to run vrp<font color="#E5E5E5"> hsrp jail be paid</font>

1217
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:05,560
between sites you

1218
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,919
are either going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need physical</font>

1219
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:11,740
connectivity or layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 conductivity or</font>

1220
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:13,900
I've had to do this with some tunneled

1221
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:18,370
bridging through layer 3 and it was

1222
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:21,310
truly ugly you can do it you know you

1223
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:23,680
can do a GRE tunnel between but convince

1224
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:28,120
it's all one subnet but you really want

1225
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:30,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you typically is in</font>

1226
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:33,670
these situations for medics which for

1227
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:35,799
example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have 7 v orfe addresses that</font>

1228
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:38,590
have to be trapped each pair<font color="#E5E5E5"> of coil</font>

1229
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:41,440
agents has unique pair of unique

1230
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:43,300
addresses and a virtual address and then

1231
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,430
the second group has a second one and

1232
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:47,560
then there's a sort of a super<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vrba</font>

1233
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:49,750
wrote on their own would set selects

1234
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">between the two clusters so you actually</font>

1235
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:54,010
percolate your way up through seven

1236
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:56,470
addresses that can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

1237
00:55:54,010 --> 00:56:02,590
servers but that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really need</font>

1238
00:55:56,470 --> 00:56:06,669
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to get a reliable source which now</font>

1239
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:11,310
IP works but again don't think in the

1240
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:17,760
box any kissed is very nice for DNS I

1241
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:20,049
for other services like sinkholes<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">now if you're going to voice over IP</font>

your biggest problem some you're pretty

cool in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this mo at some point you</font>

to the rest of telephone world now if

1252
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:47,919
you have one what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a good way</font>

1253
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:51,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it if someone offers you a sip</font>

1254
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,960
proxy the chances they know that sip

1255
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:55,600
exists and they could offer that and

1256
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,700
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could make you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know church who can</font>

1260
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:08,770

1261
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:12,520
doing however in one case we dealt<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1262
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:15,030
was they said oh how do we do that well

1263
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:17,430
we have a nortel

1264

as 200 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> connects near exchange for</font>

1265
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:23,009
birds you can end to that and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

1266
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:27,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">well yeah but how do we connect to it it</font>

1267
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:30,870
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> t ones and he said yeah and</font>

1268
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:32,340
t3's<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so what we did is we wound up</font>

1269
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:36,000
with the situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> will give analog</font>

1270
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:39,750
phones went to a local loop the then

1271
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,940
went into a t1 channel Bank<font color="#CCCCCC"> and or a</font>

1272
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:46,860
couple of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then in ones when OC</font>

1273
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:50,760

putting in you know DWDM OC 192 in order

1425
01:04:27,609 --> 01:04:31,089

1466
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:14,230
video control board would be a great

1467
01:06:10,569 --> 01:06:16,359
place to do that so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> went in and</font>

1468
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:18,130
luckily the operator wasn't in there at

1469

01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:24,038
not everything stopped pretending for a

1472
01:06:22,599 --> 01:06:27,849
few minutes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then Tiger woke up again</font>

1473
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:30,849
and he decided was a nice place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he</font>

1477
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:42,098
wet control panel I'm told it took them

1478
01:06:38,589 --> 01:06:49,859
three months to deodorize the studio ok

1479
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:53,170
what's your equivalent<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok fair enough</font>

i'll call it formally the end of it at

1481
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:56,109
this point you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i had some</font>

about alternate voice communication

1488
01:07:06,309 --> 01:07:11,230
there are a lot of options<font color="#CCCCCC"> available to</font>

1489
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:14,230
you think about your local hospital fire

01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:15,430
police all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will work with you they</font>

1491

1492
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:21,430
can make a good case for DMI services up

1493
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:22,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll put this on an analyst also are</font>

1494
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:25,118
some places though you may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1495
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:26,339
contact and get some of these services

1496
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:29,650
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> mainly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a business opportunity</font>

1497
01:07:26,339 --> 01:07:34,230
but certainly these are ways to keep

1498
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:34,230
things up thank
