00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">rajagopal from foundry networks</font>

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,928
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard of foundry if you have</font>

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:18,270
if um not do come over to be and Gary

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,359
went if not if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you only heard of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,759
that's fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> too please come over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to what</font>

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">you often say is one of the best</font>

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:31,740
barangay part so my topic for today is

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,989
multi provider ethernet service delivery

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,510
and in the course of talking to several

13
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:40,500
providers and also several businesses so

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:43,320
contemplating purchasing ethernet

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,940
service delivery this<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed to be kind</font>

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,399
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> topic which caught the interest of</font>

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,489
many folks it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about it today so first of all</font>

19
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:56,370
in terms of what i plan to cover

20
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:59,430
hopefully this will take about 20-25

21
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes maybe and since we are ahead of</font>

22
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,990
schedule you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good time for Q&A</font>

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,909
towards then so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i plan to cover is</font>

24
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:12,630
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly is multi provider ethernet</font>

25
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,290
service delivery the<font color="#E5E5E5"> typical way in</font>

26
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,939
which is done today a<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposal model</font>

27
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,430
also comparison with other<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential</font>

28
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:23,158
approaches benefits challenges and then

29
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:28,470
open it up for interactive discussion

30
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:30,509
towards the end it's always a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

31
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,400
question to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask before talking and</font>

32
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,799
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem if there's</font>

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a need for it so we made the</font>

34
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">drivers for large-scale ethernet service</font>

35
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,619
deployment across multi<font color="#CCCCCC"> provider</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">networks which is really what it multi</font>

37
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:48,390
providing ethernet service delivery is

38
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,329
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> really many drivers for it today</font>

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> first and foremost being the</font>

40
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:57,689
increasing globalization of customers

<font color="#CCCCCC">who purchase such services number two</font>

42
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,089
being the fact that the reality is that

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a limited reach of providers and</font>

44
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,329
the lots of local providers that are

more<font color="#E5E5E5"> common</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than what it says global</font>

into provider handoffs

48
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:19,100
and oftentimes business continuity

49
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,320
reasons might require enterprises<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

connect critical sites to a second

provider another thing which is

52
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:33,020
important I guess in the wake of the Dow

53
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,790
hitting a new record last week is the

54
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:39,040
fact that integration of networks after

55
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:41,600
acquisition is also something we're in

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,810
multi<font color="#CCCCCC"> provided service table comes to</font>

57
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,150
play so I think of us ourselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> as being</font>

58
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:50,450
in the Dow 12,000 era at the risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

68
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:19,579
something that we can expect customers

69
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:21,680
to have so reset to what is done today

70
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,320
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> predominantly it's a point-to-point</font>

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:33,350
multi-point services are eel and service

74
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:35,739
as MAF likes to call it are mainly

delivered as transparent land services

76
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:40,430
we're all aware about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> limitations in</font>

terms of scalability<font color="#E5E5E5"> there the</font>

78
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,730
complexity in management and it's fair

79
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,410
to say that we pls is now beginning to

80
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,869
pick up in terms of offering<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service</font>

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,950
fast-growing market even though it's

small today compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the alternatives</font>

and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> majority services continue to be</font>

leased line friendly or ATM perhaps the

86
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:08,630
two big challenges continue to be the

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,119
geographic coverage that continues to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

88
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,340
the big hindrance in terms of increasing

90
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,048
you were to break it down into why this

91
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:21,829
is such a big problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it as one</font>

92
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:22,969
reach of fiber and<font color="#CCCCCC"> be reach of the</font>

00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:26,000
provider

94
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:28,310
and this presentation talks specifically

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,380
more in terms of addressing the reach of

96
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:34,700
the provider is using how we as a

97
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:40,580
community can cooperate to have inter

98
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:43,039
provider or multi<font color="#CCCCCC"> provided services so</font>

99
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:45,080
the proposed model here is is fairly

100
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,730
simple assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got to</font>

101
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:52,310
provider networks and this there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

102
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:54,140
kind of important in terms of how

103
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:58,010
ethernet service delivery is done within

104
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:01,099
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network the idea is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

105
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,630
simplified external and in a or a

106
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,760
network network interface between the

107
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,219
provider boundaries and the water

108
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:10,370
proposes using the recently standardized

109
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:12,050
I Triple E eighty two dot one ed so

110
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,900
essentially what you have here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a case</font>

111
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,690
wherein you've got for example customer

112
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">E which got some sites where in that</font>

113
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,440
could easily be<font color="#CCCCCC"> committed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provide a</font>

114
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:25,730
once network and maybe it's got some

115
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,530
sites which cannot be<font color="#E5E5E5"> addressed directly</font>

116
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:31,760
by provider one but can be at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

117
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:33,590
provided to so<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide a 12 need to kind</font>

118
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,710
of maybe have an agreement so that they

119
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,820
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> help deliver an ethernet service</font>

120
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,359
by the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of</font>

121
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:47,060
point-to-multipoint between all the

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:50,330
sites that connect customer hey with

123
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:53,180
this example where the the diagram talks

124
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:56,169
about using vpls within the provider one

125
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,550
network there<font color="#E5E5E5"> really isn't any you know</font>

126
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:00,890
impose meant in this model as to what

127
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:05,990
the technology should be used within a

128
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:08,990
providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so the model in words</font>

129
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,450
each provider is responsible for his or

130
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,460
her own network and for what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I call a</font>

131
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:16,969
simple handoffs to the adjacent

132
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,890
providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and as mentioned</font>

133
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,950
before each provider independently

134
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,570
chooses the appropriate technology to

135
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:27,349
transport ethernet service over the

136
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:29,630
domain so you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using vpls you</font>

137
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:33,940
could be using just ethernet over mpls

138
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,940
we just using point-to-point VPNs

139
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:40,949
if for some reason there's a resistance

140
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:44,330
to move the MPLS based networks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

141
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:46,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">find with having a pure layer to network</font>

142
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:50,219
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Godwin a hedge or the emergent one</font>

143
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:51,930
eh that's fine too<font color="#E5E5E5"> or if somebody wants</font>

144
00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:55,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it with EP v3 within a providers</font>

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:57,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and have Ethernet over into TP</font>

146
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,610
that's perfectly fine to the goal here

182
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:02,639
kind of appears as if it's really very

183
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:05,180
similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Q and Q but release although</font>

there are encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> related</font>

186
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:10,699
fundamentally quite different from that

187
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:16,709
but some of the things which are useful

188
00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:18,449
from the point of view<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the NNI is</font>

189
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:22,619
that there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> discard eligible</font>

190
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:24,540
indicator which is there in the outer or

191
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:30,889
the service tag or the service VLAN ID

192
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:36,300
and the C VLAN ID or the C tag format is

193
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:39,750
fairly similar to the wheel

194
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,670
encapsulation as we know today and what

195
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,009
used to be known<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 22 dot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1p is</font>

196
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:50,849
encoded as the priority code point or

197
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:54,149
PCP so in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic engineering</font>

198
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:56,040
and QoS again the approach is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a</font>

199
00:09:54,149 --> 00:09:58,350
hierarchical view of this so each

200
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,559
provider network determines the best

201
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:05,639
path within that<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and it's</font>

202
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,990
optimized within each domain what's key

203
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,360
here is that the inter provider

204
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,779
boundaries we've got the mappings

205
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:16,319
between exp 2 dot when ad PCP mappings

206
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:19,860
again assuming here that you know the

207
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:28,559
first provider uses mpls within that

208
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:31,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">network you can you're really doing this</font>

209
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:34,259
at the service instance level because

210
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:37,550
the inner tag or so to see as the

211
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:39,629
customer frames<font color="#CCCCCC"> I self being transported</font>

212
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:44,729
transparently without any modification

213
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:48,360
of that resiliency is often a big

214
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,800
concern or redundancy and the resiliency

215
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,769
mechanisms which are used by each

216
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:56,069
provider within his domain of influence

217
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:58,530
or within his network is independent of

218
00:10:56,069 --> 00:11:00,760
what other providers may be used

219
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:03,339
so again going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the example of</font>

220
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,100
using vpls for instance within a

resiliency in terms of provisioning what

230
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,540
a provider needs to know is the SV ID of

231
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:39,939
the partner provider or something that

232
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">they could agree upon and then submit a</font>

thats that's in the works right now

307
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:18,489
which goes with the descriptive and

short name of inter provider switching

hierarchical solution to offering multi

<font color="#E5E5E5">provider services with the hierarchy</font>

313
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:40,240
most importantly being aligned across

314
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:41,229
organizational boundaries it uses the

315
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,769
technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are already</font>

316
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:46,749
standardized today or well known so dot

320
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:57,910
contemplating to provide such multi

321
00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:04,329
provider service delivery gives a range

322
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:06,040
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> options to choose from one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

323
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:08,319
I find appealing here is that the

330
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,550
challenges which are probably more at

331
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:29,170
the operational level as opposed to the

<font color="#CCCCCC">technology in the first of all is the</font>

335
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:40,720
challenges I would guess in terms of

336
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:42,250
inter provider service delivery the

337
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:47,740
first one is of course who owns the

338
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:50,050
customer this is the customer owned by

339
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:54,250
the provider with whom contact was first

340
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,810
made or maybe have a policy where and

341
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,750
there is ownership based on geographical

342
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:02,619
regions so I'm a provider based on the

343
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:04,720
west coast and maybe I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an</font>

344
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:09,459
agreement with somebody who serves the

345
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,520
UK area and because I've got no interest

346
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:17,290
in having<font color="#E5E5E5"> local service in the UK here</font>

347
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:18,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe anybody who is a customer in the</font>

348
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,790
UK area becomes my partner's customers

349
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:26,050
and anybody else would in my local area

350
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:27,520
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> my customers you could also</font>

351
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:30,940
have revenue sharing arrangements based

352
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:34,740
on any such criteria of course I'd

353
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:37,810
welcome other thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of</font>

354
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,110
revenue sharing agreements that that we

355
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,110
could have

356
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,879
the other one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in terms of the</font>

357
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:53,120
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end-user ownership later</font>

358
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,130
to provisioning so a logical next step

359
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,260
would be even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though it's a pretty</font>

360
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,430
significant leap forward would be to

361
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,100
have the provisioning systems of

362
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:03,050
providers be integrated to simplify tend

363
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:06,649
to end provisioning and I guess this

364
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:08,840
really is driven by the number of

365
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,750
instances of you know Ethernet services

366
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:15,770
where you'd be having multi provider

367
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:19,820
segments billing account and accounting

368
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:24,230
and as we saw before SLA guarantee is

369
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:26,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">mating that is certainly not trivial so</font>

370
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">while well negotiating a part in</font>

371
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,020
agreement here I think it's important

372
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:33,920
it's important that the two providers

373
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:38,840
agree on what is the SLA that could have

374
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:40,910
we upon at least for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunnel ditto</font>

375
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:46,370
for troubleshooting and n customer

376
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:48,770
outage the the customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> whose purchase</font>

377
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,389
in the internet service needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> know who</font>

378
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,670
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> take responsibility for the</font>

379
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,290
resolution and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple answer to this</font>

380
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:56,000
would be the provider who sends<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bill</font>

381
00:18:54,290 --> 00:19:01,850
to the customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> she takes responsibility</font>

382
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:04,370
for for this so that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much what</font>

383
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,620
I hadn't before we open it up for Q&A I

384
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:08,449
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to take a small poll how many</font>

385
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,219
of you are contemplating or actually

386
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:16,930
already doing multi provided services

387
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:19,750
today great thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

388
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,190
so that's it that I had and feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

389
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:26,670
come over<font color="#E5E5E5"> to microphone and have some</font>

390
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:30,310
questions yes sir keith mitchell is see

391
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,690
I've done quite a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

392
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:34,260
and to provide a provisioning in the

393
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:37,720
past and there's a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of issues</font>

394
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:40,120
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think one of the biggest ones is that</font>

395
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,510
layer to infrastructure is much more

396
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:47,350
fragile than layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 IP and it's very</font>

397
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:49,120
easy for stray layer to traffic

398
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,899
particularly if it's non unicast traffic

399
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,189
and one providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> network to cause</font>

400
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,260
operational issues and another providers

401
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:57,460
across the interconnect I'd be

402
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,140
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if this approach</font>

403
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,240
you're proposing has any mechanisms to

404
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:06,850
help prevent and deal with these kind of

405
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:10,750
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so first of all just to make</font>

406
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:12,399
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it more explicit what's</font>

407
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,890
being proposed here is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a</font>

408
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">layer to infrastructure but the focus is</font>

409
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:19,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">on providing layer to service which</font>

410
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,550
means that could be built<font color="#E5E5E5"> and powerful</font>

411
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:26,110
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 infrastructure so for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instance</font>

412
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:29,169
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when we talked about mpls layer</font>

413
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:31,419
2 VPNs being used<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee being built</font>

414
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,670
over a lazy infrastructure so it's the

415
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:42,100
handoffs where you really have in the

416
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:43,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">layer to hand off secretin ok but this</font>

417
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,459
still layer to service being provided in

418
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,770
to end and there's still the possibility

419
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,770
of interconnection of different layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

420
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:56,889
infrastructures and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there to traffic</font>

421
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:59,260
causing problems right so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

422
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:01,510
something the customer decides or the

423
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:07,800
end customer decides to purchase as a

424
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:07,800
layer 2 service right<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

425
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:14,270
so question for you first and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

426
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,649
like to poll the audience do you think

427
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:19,070
providers are going to have any concern

428
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:23,210
about broadcast flooding and unknown

429
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:25,550
unicast going across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wide area all</font>

430
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,820
right so I guess it goes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to no</font>

431
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:31,700
question the previous gentleman asked

432
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:33,169
absolutely and I think while planning

433
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,050
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> network like this we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to</font>

434
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:38,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">have you know checks in place to make</font>

435
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:40,340
sure that that does not happen and I

436
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's fair to say that most</font>

437
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:45,230
equipment in the market today already

438
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,690
have those mechanisms in place I just

439
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,940
want to be emphasizing in that the goal

440
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:51,680
here is not to have a layer to

441
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,830
infrastructure but only to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a later</font>

442
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:58,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">service that's being a delivery</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> until</font>

443
00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:01,610
end but all the current proposals don't

444
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:03,020
address this issue very well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font>

445
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:05,419
proposing that something needs to be

446
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:08,690
fixed or brought to the standards

447
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:11,360
community to deal with this right so I

448
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:14,690
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are already efforts underway</font>

449
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:19,419
for instance at the I Triple E and ITF

450
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:23,600
in terms of curtailing broadcast terms

451
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:26,150
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got so much futuristic I</font>

452
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:30,530
think it start to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right</font>

453
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:33,650
now without really you know getting into

454
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:35,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">something which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll see at least a</font>

455
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,250
couple of years from commercial

456
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,870
deployment right now and you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

457
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:44,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hierarchy will allow a scalable</font>

458
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:46,429
service have you received or try to get

459
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:50,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">any data on the number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> max that can</font>

460
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:53,090
be supported over this or you suggest a

461
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,629
safe deployment is the front end the

462
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:59,139
service with routers right so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

463
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:01,820
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about point-to-point</font>

464
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,430
deployments then there's really no need

465
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:06,169
for doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> macado's learning the issue</font>

466
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:11,680
comes more in the point of

467
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:14,750
point-to-multipoint services right so

468
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,280
yes there are certainly you know limits

469
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,730
there that punch will be cognizant about

470
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,730
and

471
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:24,049
the only thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

472
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,230
it's an important consideration while

473
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:29,990
planning out your network in terms of

474
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:32,600
designing the the equipment<font color="#CCCCCC"> that needs</font>

475
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:35,570
to be chosen as well as the way the

476
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,039
network's laid out<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'd like to hear</font>

477
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:43,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the audience says if anybody's an</font>

478
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:46,370
opinion yeah hi just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a correction on the</font>

479
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,260
multi-segment pseudowire and in fact we

480
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement towards an of last year</font>

481
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:53,299
interrupt with the two vendors and in

482
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:56,240
deployment right now and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

483
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:58,279
beyond concepting ITF matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fact we</font>

484
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,260
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain OEM and grandfather</font>

485
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:01,970
stuff already so what have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

486
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,240
considered as other solutions are<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

487
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:08,450
working is running deployment thank you

488
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:12,230
ok so to just lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a conceptual I</font>

489
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:17,029
meant you know it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a draft stage</font>

490
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:19,750
but thank you for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> correction other</font>

491
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">comments or questions</font>
