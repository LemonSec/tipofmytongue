00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm Nick feemster I'm going to give a

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:13,469
brief talk on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on mining DNS PL</font>

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,189
queries my co-author here David<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dagan is</font>

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:19,789
sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> right beside me and my student</font>

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:24,810
on rude<font color="#CCCCCC"> ramachandran did a lot of the</font>

6
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:27,240
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the heavy lifting here so this</font>

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,990
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a fun little study that we that</font>

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,149
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did with seeing basically what we</font>

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,239
could mine out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS blacklist</font>

10
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:40,370
queries the idea from this for this

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:44,250
study actually came<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a piece of spam</font>

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,870
mail that David got as you know we've

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,180
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a bit of research</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in spam and</font>

14
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,750
we actually read our spam from time to

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:55,829
time so so we we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea from from</font>

16
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:59,100
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email that David had where a bot</font>

17
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:02,489
master was selling a fairly large bot

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:06,170
and it said you know rent out this set

19
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:09,929
of bots<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a certain amount of time</font>

20
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:13,860
nineteen hundred dollars all the IP

21
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,630
addresses in this botnet are unlisted in

22
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,180
blacklist and we thought hmm that's

23
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,798
really interesting how do you how do

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">they know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're unlisted of</font>

25
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,330
course they could be lying but you know

26
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,350
it's assume for a minute that you know

27
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,929
in fact they know what they're talking

28
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,490
about well they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some way</font>

29
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,920
of figuring this out right so we thought

30
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,899
okay well perhaps these guys are

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,090
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking up the status of the</font>

32
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:41,430
bots in the blacklist so let's go look

33
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:45,509
let's let's let's use this as an

34
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:49,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity can we actually mine the DNS</font>

35
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:51,689
blacklist queries to reveal this kind of

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,610
reconnaissance so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably a</font>

37
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">little different than some of the DNS</font>

38
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,340
blacklist studies you've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

39
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,169
which are looking at perhaps you know

40
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,630
what's actually in the blacklist here

41
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,939
we're turning things on on their head a

42
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,190
little bit we're looking at who's doing

43
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,508
lookups to the blacklist and can we get

44
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,980
information of

45
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:16,708
about bad players from who's actually

46
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:20,609
doing the lookups so that's in a

47
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:24,390
nutshell the inside behind behind this

48
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:26,849
little fishing expedition of course

49
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,369
there are lots of legitimate lookups

50
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:30,988
coming to the DNS blacklist so the the

51
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,129
key<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenges actually how can we</font>

52
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:39,000
figure out in this huge mess of queries

53
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:41,608
what queries are legitimate<font color="#CCCCCC"> acquis</font>

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,250
reason what are you know what constitute

55
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:46,739
this reconnaissance activity so we're

56
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,720
going to basically develop some<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

57
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:53,370
heuristics on that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not perfect</font>

58
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,709
as you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see but even using some of</font>

59
00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:01,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">these heuristics we found we've got some</font>

60
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:02,489
pretty surprising things there there's a

61
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,290
there's a paper on this which you can

62
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,840
which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get is linked off off off</font>

63
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,849
of my my<font color="#CCCCCC"> webpage if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you just google for</font>

64
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,180
that where we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about temporal</font>

65
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:14,429
properties but most of our study focuses

66
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,340
on these spatial heuristics which I'm

67
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:22,049
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe next so as I mentioned</font>

68
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:25,709
this is not perfect because large ISPs

69
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:28,470
obviously use different mail servers for

70
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:32,910
inbound and outbound traffic but there

71
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">are hacks that you can do to to sort of</font>

72
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:39,599
account for that as well the basic idea

73
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:40,679
still applies if you consider the you

74
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,569
know the inbound and outbound mail

75
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,230
server as a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> node if you know what</font>

76
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:52,078
those IP addresses are the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

77
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:54,358
simple actually the heuristic relies on

78
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,940
the inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> legitimate</font>

79
00:03:54,359 --> 00:04:00,180
mail server or set of mail servers that

80
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:04,079
that server or group of servers is going

81
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:07,769
to be both the subject and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> target of</font>

82
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:10,349
DNS blacklist lookups that is it's going

83
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:12,000
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sending and receiving mail right</font>

84
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:14,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">because when it receives mail it's going</font>

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,889
to perform lookups to the blacklist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

86
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:19,829
when it sends mail to other people other

87
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:22,410
people will be looking it up so there's

88
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:27,990
sort of a symmetry going on there

89
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:30,840
in the reconnaissance case in fact what

90
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:34,590
we were looking for was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lack of this</font>

91
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,780
symmetry that is the a host performing

92
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:40,770
reconnaissance<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be doing lots of</font>

93
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:44,190
lookups to the blacklist but is will

94
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,870
never get looked up itself so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

95
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,290
was sort of what we started out looking

96
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,150
for in fact went when we dug a little

97
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,860
deeper we found some some some more

98
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,650
surprising things but that's that's sort

99
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,200
of the basic insight that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use to sort</font>

100
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:02,429
of tease apart legitimate queries from

101
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:05,210
reconnaissance queries<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is sort</font>

102
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:10,230
of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic the basic measurement</font>

103
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:13,109
approach we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very large</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spamhaus</font>

104
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:15,840
mirror at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Georgia Tech that David has</font>

105
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:19,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">been has been putting together that we</font>

106
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,450
used for the basis of the analysis we

107
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:25,200
then constructed this this graph of

108
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:27,840
who's querying whom the graph is giant

109
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,390
so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason</font>

110
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,979
we're in the research forum I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

111
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:34,260
get to some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the difficulties at the</font>

112
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,480
end but we needed to sort of prune it to

113
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,500
see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could get a sub graph and</font>

114
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,860
start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for anything interesting</font>

115
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">in there so we we pruned it actually by</font>

116
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,690
looking first at like for some of these

117
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,919
some of these nodes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we know were</font>

118
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:52,050
interesting IP addresses that we knew to

119
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,710
been involved in some botnet activity

120
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:58,919
previously and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we looked at what</font>

121
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:03,030
nodes in this graph had<font color="#CCCCCC"> hi out debris</font>

122
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:06,719
that is what nodes are sending a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

123
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:09,239
queries to the blacklist that are not

124
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:14,550
actually being targets of queries

125
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:16,350
themselves so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a a graphical</font>

126
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,440
representation of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically this</font>

127
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:21,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the spatial heuristic we're applying</font>

128
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,430
for every edge where some<font color="#E5E5E5"> host a is</font>

129
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,620
looking sending a look up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> B to the</font>

130
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">dns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VL we're adding an edge to this</font>

131
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,740
query graph and then we're extracting

132
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,810
nodes

133
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,580
have have this high out to read and

134
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:37,889
agree ratio and looking to see what we

135
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:40,740
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things actually we</font>

136
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:42,720
sort of thought we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought okay if we</font>

137
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:47,280
were doing this reconnaissance how would

138
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,960
we do it well of course the five seconds

139
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,409
of thinking would get you to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

140
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,789
approach which is we call this

141
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party reconnaissance this is</font>

142
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:59,818
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some dedicated machine</font>

143
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:02,310
just pounding a blacklist of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course this</font>

144
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:08,569
type of thing we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of expected to be</font>

145
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:10,470
the predominant technique hence the

146
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:11,940
heuristic we developed right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean this</font>

147
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,900
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exactly the kind of thing that</font>

148
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:20,789
heuristic would pick out pretty well we

149
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:24,030
did see some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this there are a couple</font>

150
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:27,750
other techniques the 15 seconds of

151
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:29,789
thinking might get you to these<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

152
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,620
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach that we that we that we</font>

153
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:33,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for which was a sort of</font>

154
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,979
self reconnaissance approach which says

155
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,000
well you've got a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to look</font>

156
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:41,190
up all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> spot i pee addresses but</font>

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,719
you may also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a botnet so why not</font>

158
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use the botnet to start doing</font>

159
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:53,659
lookups on these IP addresses

160
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:58,080
distributed computing cutting edge so

161
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:59,819
this we did not see very much at all in

162
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">fact it's a really dumb idea right</font>

163
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:06,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you know a machine looking up</font>

164
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,159
itself that's never going to happen in

165
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,110
any legitimate case it's it's very easy

166
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:14,370
to detect so unsurprisingly we didn't

167
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:16,650
see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that this this third</font>

168
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,819
approach which actually which when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

169
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:21,780
started this work we sort of thought

170
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:23,880
okay this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably something that as</font>

171
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,830
these guys get more clever and as we as

172
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,789
we you know as this heuristic gets

173
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,318
published the bots the bat masters will

174
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:33,149
move on to doing something like this

175
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,589
distributed reconnaissance where you

176
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:38,070
actually distribute the workload have

177
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:41,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">BOTS look up you know other BOTS</font>

178
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:44,580
in the same botnet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> other botnets etc</font>

179
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:50,040
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually we very surprisingly</font>

180
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:51,690
witnessed evidence of this we were

181
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:57,260
really surprised<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see this let me sort</font>

182
00:08:51,690 --> 00:09:01,590
of show you what we saw here actually so

183
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:03,120
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're if you remember</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from nano 37</font>

184
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:08,760
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a large spam</font>

185
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:12,210
whole spam sinkhole database spam

186
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,670
sinkhole data feed that we use to do the

187
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,560
spam and bgp hijack data so this is

188
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,329
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same data set that we used</font>

189
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,099
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in this study so what we did is</font>

190
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,280
we we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two sets of IP addresses</font>

191
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:26,580
right we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a set of IP addresses</font>

192
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:29,819
that we know are hitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> our spam</font>

193
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,850
sinkhole and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we prune those</font>

194
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,260
first down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the intersection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of IP</font>

195
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,320
addresses that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hitting our spam</font>

196
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,240
sinkhole that we knew to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be botnets okay</font>

197
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,200
so now we've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of IP addresses</font>

198
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:46,100
that we know are our botnet IP addresses

199
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,650
that are that are spamming our sinkhole

200
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,930
then what we actually the second set of

201
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:55,140
data<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we had was of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the high</font>

202
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,760
out degree nodes that is the the set of

203
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,069
nodes in the spam house trace that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

204
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,870
sending lots of queries to the blacklist

205
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:07,800
but not getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> queried a lot themselves</font>

206
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:09,960
what we found rather surprisingly was

207
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,120
that some of these high out<font color="#E5E5E5"> degree nodes</font>

208
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,520
which I've shown on the right we're

209
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:19,250
actually there were edges<font color="#E5E5E5"> going into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

210
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:24,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">bots that were spamming are our sinkhole</font>

211
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:26,030
those actually were not about IP

212
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:32,250
addresses that we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew about</font>

213
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:34,380
already so that was actually probably

214
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:38,610
the most surprising finding that we

215
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:41,280
in this little study was that sort of by

216
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,630
taking these two data<font color="#E5E5E5"> sets and linking</font>

217
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:47,040
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> together you can actually start</font>

218
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,780
with some small set of things maybe you

219
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,370
know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be bots and actually bootstrap</font>

220
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:55,650
up to get to get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> larger set in the</font>

221
00:10:53,370 --> 00:11:00,960
middle of the of the slide here<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

222
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:02,640
shown basically some of the I've removed

223
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,650
the IP addresses to protect the guilty

224
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,319
but those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the AS IS in which we</font>

225
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">found nodes for that had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very high out</font>

226
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:17,070
degrees and in fact the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in degree of all</font>

227
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:21,900
of those notes there was zero so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

228
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:23,760
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is basically just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CCDF it's a</font>

229
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,959
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> tough to read but the main point</font>

230
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,600
is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've drawn out there with the</font>

231
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:31,230
arrow which basically shows that you

232
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,470
know ninety<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of these nodes that</font>

233
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:37,800
we see are only issuing one query so

234
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:39,990
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know it is perhaps the case</font>

235
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,069
of this simple spatial heuristic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

236
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,690
we've come up with may need to be

237
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:49,080
refined because in fact it looks like

238
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,640
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> bots masters are actually quite</font>

239
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,020
sophisticated already at distributing

240
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,490
these these these types of

241
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:59,760
reconnaissance queries<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what does</font>

242
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:02,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">this all mean we were really surprised</font>

243
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,580
actually if I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a bad</font>

244
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:09,030
news these guys are way ahead of us we

245
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:11,310
had sort of speculated on how the you

246
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:13,980
know we first weren't even sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

247
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:17,880
this reconnaissance was going on we

248
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,290
figured it might be worse than worse

249
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,360
than what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we expected not only is it</font>

250
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on but there's some pretty</font>

251
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,410
advanced techniques that these guys are

252
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:29,520
using to perform this reconnaissance

253
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,430
there's a flip side to the coin though

254
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,740
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are some spatial</font>

255
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,900
dependencies in this graph right so we

256
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,730
could you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got two data</font>

257
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,220
sets for example if you start with

258
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,600
something like a spam sinkhole like I

259
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,970
should

260
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:49,029
before it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to for example</font>

261
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,199
maybe mine the query graph and see well

262
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:53,180
we know these guys are up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to no good</font>

263
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:54,859
let's look at who's querying the

264
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,888
blacklist and who you know are there any

265
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:59,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody any other nodes querying those</font>

266
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:00,829
nodes that we know are up to no good and

267
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,240
perhaps that tells us<font color="#CCCCCC"> something about</font>

268
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:11,000
those so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all sounds really you know</font>

269
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:13,399
really easy to do but uh there are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

270
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,980
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a few problems of course and</font>

271
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,509
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the that's again as I</font>

272
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,720
mentioned as I alluded to why we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

273
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:23,899
the research forum figuring out<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

274
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,690
how to mine this query graph is pretty

275
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:28,610
intensive both computationally and in

276
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:31,100
terms of storing the graph it's it's

277
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:36,380
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> massive as I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did some</font>

278
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:37,759
some sort of hacky pruning to get it

279
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,769
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a size where we could look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font>

280
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:42,019
piece of it that we that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we thought</font>

281
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:44,630
might be might be interesting with high

282
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:47,689
likelihood but actually doing what I

283
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,819
just said in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of like taking a</font>

284
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:52,819
small set in bootstrapping up using the

285
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:56,810
query graph is turns out to be a lot

286
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:58,310
harder than it sounds although it's

287
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,160
certainly true that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that starting out</font>

288
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:04,579
with some pruning techniques may be

289
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:08,449
promising so that's that pretty much

290
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:11,599
concludes my talk I'll take some

291
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:14,949
questions if there's done<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks there's</font>

292
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:19,880
also a six-page tech report or short

293
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:22,670
shruti workshop paper on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> homepage you</font>

294
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,910
can you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more details</font>

295
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,910
there

296
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:39,580
Nick Randy busia IJ um I have a fear the

297
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:41,349
too few people use bought spam

298
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,580
prevention techniques such as dns<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

299
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:47,290
BLS and one indication might be what

300
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,480
proportion of the queries total queries

301
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:53,620
are represented by botnets proving

302
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,970
they're clean is it significant you

303
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,620
saying what percentage of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> total</font>

304
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:00,550
queries are this type of reconnaissance

305
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:06,610
right very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> low is it slow yeah okay</font>

306
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:09,160
thanks there seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be some general</font>

307
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,450
interest in fingerprinting requests I

308
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,230
don't know if that's possible for

309
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:16,750
requiring in this particular case would

310
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">it make sense to see if is a pattern</font>

311
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:21,520
when a particular fingerprint of the

312
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:27,390
query to blacklist to see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> one I can</font>

313
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:30,579
identify the evil from<font color="#E5E5E5"> be normal queries</font>

314
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:33,460
they essentially the same minded

315
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,020
undistinguishable queries you sing are

316
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,090
there other heuristics or properties

317
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,710
that we can have users features to

318
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,210
distinguish the legitimate yeah because

319
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:44,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have presumably all running the same</font>

320
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:47,560
version of a software that's that's

321
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:49,540
possible they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be running the same</font>

322
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,829
version of the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that that</font>

323
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,319
might be something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look for we have</font>

324
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,490
this video I'm sorry go ahead oh I was

325
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,460
going to say there are there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are other</font>

326
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:59,440
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that that also we might</font>

327
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,960
we might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look for based on</font>

328
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:07,030
the fact that legitimate queries are

329
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:08,500
driven by actually emails being sent so

330
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,170
there might be a fingerprint for that

331
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,170
that we could say ah well these follow a

332
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,490
pattern we'd expect and the rest are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

333
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,260
second follow-on question is there any

334
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,700
temporal correlation between rees

335
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,069
queries<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they just kind of randomly</font>

336
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,110
pop up although is their kind of a all I

337
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">just got myself a new botnet I need to</font>

338
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,830
do the query and then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do because</font>

339
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:29,110
I really no need to do that repeatedly

340
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,220
like you would do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> email that's a</font>

341
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,590
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know an answer</font>

342
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,210
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe david has looked at at some</font>

343
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,830
of the following<font color="#E5E5E5"> like temporal</font>

344
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:38,050
correlations we didn't study the

345
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,240
temporal properties in this so so the

346
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,899
the intuition we<font color="#CCCCCC"> gained</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

347
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,250
to reduce some of the data is that

348
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,410
techniques such as bucket izing and

349
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,510
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things into epics really don't</font>

350
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:52,329
reduce this volume of the data and this

351
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:55,480
indicates that there's a very low and

352
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:57,610
slow pattern being used in other words

353
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,860
an individual bot might do<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

354
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:03,880
handful of queries over the course of an

355
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:05,679
entire day and this tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> match some</font>

356
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,010
of the patterns<font color="#E5E5E5"> of spamming behavior</font>

357
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,020
that we sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> see for spam bots that</font>

358
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,490
send out just a small number below a

359
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:16,800
threshold than an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP might be</font>

360
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:19,449
patrolling yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to echo that point</font>

361
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,609
the low<font color="#E5E5E5"> and slow thing does show up in</font>

362
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:24,640
the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> spam data that we see as well</font>

363
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:26,198
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of this both in the</font>

364
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,880
reconnaissance and in the spamming

365
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:43,150
that's clearly explicitly designed to

366
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:44,679
slip under radars thanks just just

367
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,230
momentary note sorry to barge in again

368
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,480
Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> bush um when you've got a hundred</font>

369
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bots and you're testing a</font>

370
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:58,660
hundred thousand addresses each box does

371
00:17:52,240 --> 00:18:02,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">not have to do very many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay our next</font>

372
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,670
speaker is hopefully here somewhere
