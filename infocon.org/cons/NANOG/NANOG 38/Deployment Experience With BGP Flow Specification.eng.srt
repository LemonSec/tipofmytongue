00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,240
get to the good stuff which is actual

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:20,730
actually looks like in a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so</font>

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,740
first the problem you know today

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,529
providers have some limited means for

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,630
mitigating large-scale DDoS attacks back

10
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,698
from Danny and I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the survey earlier</font>

this year<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the year before the most</font>

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,380
common way that providers mitigated tax

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,380
is by black holing<font color="#CCCCCC"> while this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

14
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,360
effective to stop the attack traversing

15
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,160
the providers network is perhaps less

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,800
effective for actually helping the

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,739
customers website sequel servers or

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,480
other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are under attack and</font>

19
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,370
it turns out that not all customers are

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,099
clueless many of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are but not quite</font>

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,828
all and there's been a growing push from

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,859
many customers for providers to offer

23
00:00:54,829 --> 00:01:00,629

24
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,100

destination black holing tackles all of

35
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,619
which have fairly serious implications

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:34,439
on customer traffic or fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

38
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,270
flow specification well the basic idea

39
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,919
is that we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> this thing called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

40
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,740
and we've got lots of experience

41
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,250
stuffing all the stuff into bgp that may

42

if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could stick some other stuff in</font>

47
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:02,490
BGP like firewall rules I use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

dynamically pass firewall rules around

51
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,480
on the network not only intro provider

52
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,280
but perhaps even

53
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,329
we could do this between<font color="#E5E5E5"> providers and</font>

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,150
filter closer to the source of attacks

55
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:23,629
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the high level what is BGP</font>

56
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:27,080
flow specification will jump into a few

<font color="#E5E5E5">details so what is a flow specification</font>

58
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,209
well is just another address family yet

59
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,849
another opaque address family that<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">discretes independently of the v4 or v6</font>

the basic what you'd expect discard rate

66
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,019
limit but there's also some really nifty

67
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:56,780
capabilities which will speak about

68
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:59,590
shortly including redirection based on

69
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">things matching this firewall rule and</font>

the ICMP code paketsize the SCP TTL and

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:21,200
in an example of a least an ask example

of a filter below is you know match<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

these ports and for this / 24 so

78
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:29,299
significantly more flexibility of course

79
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:35,810
beyond what we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have which was</font>

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to BGP that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> regatta</font>

83
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,829

84
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:50,239
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the flow specification is</font>

85
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:52,459
congruent with ipv4 routing by congruent

86
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,230
I mean that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

87
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,329
different using next hop with info

88
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,790
specification it really is making sure

89
00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:01,400
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the host specification is from</font>

90
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:04,129
where we expect it to be from or that is

91
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,799
poking a hole in existing advertisement

92
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:09,440
of course as will speak later on there

93
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,180
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to set your own policy you can</font>

94
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,680
in fact if you've got devices in your

95
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,169
network announcing flow sophistication

96
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,668
turn off these policies and just trust

97
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:19,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">the device is sending the right thing</font>

98
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:22,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll speak about that shortly but</font>

99
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:24,729
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> follows many of the same rules</font>

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,680
as we know in love with ipv4 and has all

of the issues associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as</font>

102
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:35,410
well of course so why flow specification

103
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,720
what are the benefits the benefits are

104
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:41,020
you can pass her own filters with bgpz

105
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,840
ease of deployment and management and we

106
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,060
have experienced with<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP to some degree</font>

107

of solve we have solved the trust

exists today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably the strongest</font>

111
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,870
argument and it provides a way of

00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:03,039
leveraging increasingly some of the ASIC

113
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,630
filtering capabilities in routers what

114
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,000
are the drawbacks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP flow</font>

115
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,460
specification trying to provide both

sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the coin well when there are</font>

criticisms about bgp flow spec the

118
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:18,580
biggest criticism basically comes down

119
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:21,099
to that it uses EGP and as such as all

120
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,849
the faults and foibles of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp including</font>

is you can't actually query a router or

there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> predefined way to understand</font>

i'm going to start first with a slide of

167
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,700
those problems that we're facing some

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">already were mentioned by correct</font>

169
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:40,550
basically our large customers are

170
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:42,440
getting attack and we kind of have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad</font>

171
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">hoc type of response where the customer</font>

172
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,480
kind of calls into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NOC we</font>

173
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,860
investigate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and then we</font>

00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,780
generate them type of mitigation

00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,610
technique in the devices recently we

176
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,030
just allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer to advertise</font>

179
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,480
the prom that's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the aggregation</font>

180
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,070
point to the customer so that's two

181
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,890
carries the traffic all the way to the

182
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,290
to the egress point to the customer so

183
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:12,800
that's hurts the network so this attacks

184
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:14,330
are the only congest creating congestion

185
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,220
in our networks are there not only

186
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,800
intended to our customers they affect

187
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,990
the network they also affect other

188
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,129
services like both<font color="#E5E5E5"> something very</font>

189
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,849
important now

190
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:28,909
it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also ask example top sites again</font>

191
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:31,849
increment the cost of operation takes

192
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:34,729
time takes time to mitigate these are ad

193
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:36,740
hoc responses as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said so it depends on</font>

194
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:40,310
how fast you can response to these

195
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:44,360
mitigation techniques other observations

196
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:46,609
we have seen is a DDoS attacks are

197
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,470
coming from organized type of crime

198
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:52,209
botnets type of that and also they're

199
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:55,160
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a amateur type of attack so</font>

200
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:57,018
it's difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really understand from</font>

201
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,579
work we're getting those generally we

202
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:02,959
get botanist there's kind of little bit

203
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:04,849
more organized their anomaly that we

204
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,000
find but uh that's what we have seen in

205
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:11,209
our network again we have TCP syn flood

206
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,130
attackers who generate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the small packets</font>

207
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:15,800
per second that create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of damage</font>

208
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,600
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our services and again we have UDP</font>

209
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:22,579
type of fragment attacks that are also

210
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:26,180
generating problems in our network so

211
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:30,170
other observations we see is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

212
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:33,949
seeing some ICMP type of traffic to

213
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,870
trying to generate<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8h pins or whatever</font>

214
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:38,060
we try to filter that in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> network as</font>

215
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:40,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">much and we don't see a lot of those</font>

216
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,138
ICMP attacks constantly in our network

217
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">who is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect ourself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing</font>

218
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:46,880
some firewall filtering but there static

219
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,399
they stay there so in the future comes

220
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,980
kind of outdated we have to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> again and</font>

221
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,449
update the configurations others that we

222
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,800
have seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the traffic and</font>

223
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:58,540
attack that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have seen are coming from</font>

224
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,969
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> asia pacific area difficult to track</font>

225
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:05,990
difficult to identify us because of

226
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:08,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">national nat gateways so you see a lot</font>

227
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:12,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">of generation in some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know if</font>

228
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:14,899
the source is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that source here is</font>

229
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:19,490
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> diagram will use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arbor to display this</font>

230
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:21,529
where we have kind of a 2.7 million

231
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,400
packets per second of that maximum

232
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,670
sustained is not

233
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're for a certain period of time so</font>

234
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,300
just demonstrating that we get those

235
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,660
attacks and we get those reports into

236
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:35,449
our network so preview mitigation

237
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,490
approaches again black holing sometimes

238
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,320
also removing the prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the custom</font>

239
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:45,080
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other provider so that also</font>

240
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:47,240
affects oh it's it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good</font>

241
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,480
mitigation thing we also affects the

242
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,780
traffic of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer so that's a</font>

243
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,180
problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> those type of black holing</font>

244
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:58,930
sir black hole<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the destination or</font>

245
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,579
removing the prefix out of our peering

246
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">Arbor fingerprinting cheering would have</font>

247
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:08,300
done that without providers and try to

248
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:12,709
to show our signatures of attacks and

249
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:16,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">try and share with other peers and still</font>

250
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:19,760
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is just tiring requires a</font>

251
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:23,960
lot of getting contact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our peers</font>

252
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,430
and try to generate those fingerprints

253
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,160
and understand the type that we're

254
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:30,530
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mitigate so other mitigating</font>

255
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,370
challenges we see in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> network is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

256
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:36,110
so firewalling filtering and black

257
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">flowing are kind of insufficient just</font>

258
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,230
because it takes time to generate we

259
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,530
have an attack would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a signature</font>

260
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:44,720
you have a destination and a source you

261
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:46,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">try to black hole the destination you</font>

262
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,250
try to put a filter in the device so it

263
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,350
takes time to implement that so that's

264
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,360
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that are kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

265
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,950
we're looking for something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a</font>

266
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,710
little bit faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> response and other</font>

267
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:59,750
thing is uh determining the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

268
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the customer so that affects</font>

269
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,410
availability of the customer and again

270
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,810
constant configuration changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add</font>

271
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,420
and remove routes to that are black

272
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:13,010
holes in the device requires changing

273
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:15,709
configurations and all that mitigation

274
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,480
challenges again it takes from 15<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 15</font>

275
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,840
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an hour to mitigate an attack</font>

276
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,790
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all depends as if we identify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

277
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:26,240
tackle we get a call from the customer

278
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:28,459
we have to identify the filter or the

279
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,470
route try to deploy it into the device

280
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,710
I so it takes time it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a very fast</font>

281
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:36,530
response again and I I guess a lot of

282
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:38,510
operators will probably experienced

283
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:41,150
something similar I mean takes time to

284
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:44,420
do that in all depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the experience</font>

285
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,949
of the personnel working on them not or

286
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,360
working in engineering or secure

287
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,580
engineering it takes time if you have

288
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,680
only one security engineer you will take

289
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,800
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to generate the certain filter</font>

290
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,160
or or if you have more i mean the tents

291
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:00,079
it relates all the cost of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

292
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,199
group and how much people you have in

293
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:07,010
your team so mitigation today we just

294
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:09,940
started doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a deployment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of flow speck</font>

295
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:13,130
made a deployment of clothes<font color="#CCCCCC"> bag using a</font>

296
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:16,700
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a control deployment do not work</font>

299
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,870
the traffic but we're trying to do some

300
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,910
type of scalable solution where we use

301
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:31,070
bgp community architecture to be very

302
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:33,500
granular and our advertisement so we

303
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,690
advertise flows back to the specific

304
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,070
router where we get the anomaly coming

305

00:14:50,729 --> 00:14:55,410
targeting the role the geographical

338
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:56,999

339
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,919
appear if it's a transient how many

340
00:14:56,999 --> 00:15:02,789
Pearson transit you have under on the

00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:04,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">side so then all the information is</font>

342
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:06,479
gathered by seefeld data and BUP

343

information from all the other devices

345
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:13,919
have it like this simple attack but we

346
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:16,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a source and a destination to that</font>

348
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,849
going to get alarmed in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> arbor so the</font>

349
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:26,459
secure a shin center will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

350
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:27,749
mitigate that using that the technique

351
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,839
of flows back and it's going to

352
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:33,660
pre-populate that information in our

353
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:36,059
mitigation tool so what happens it gets

354
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,858
mitigated by only<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertising to that</font>

355
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:40,230
transit thanks to that community that we

356
00:15:37,859 --> 00:15:42,059
already<font color="#CCCCCC"> had in this mitigation that we</font>

357
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,970
see there is kind of a very general and

358
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:46,949
it almost looks like a filter and then

359
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,869
that destination in that port and discs

360
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:50,969
are all the traffic so anybody that is

361
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:55,230
peering in that transit is going to get

362
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:56,730
affected by by by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> far flows back</font>

363
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,939
filter so the idea is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more</font>

364
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:04,259
specific put a source or put a<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP flag</font>

365
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:07,379
will put a destination port already<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

366
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:09,169
a destination for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> for sport so the</font>

367
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:11,220
more you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put into the flow SPECT</font>

368
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:14,220
advertising the more specific you know

369
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,669
me in the less of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> origin outage</font>

370
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,439
you're going to have for the customer

371
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:20,740
again if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I generate another attack we</font>

372
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:22,810
have that come

373
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,760
source and destination and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> /</font>

374
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:27,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">a shin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> centered gets the alarm decides</font>

375
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,939
to mitigate and it decides<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mitigate</font>

376
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:33,250
using the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix of / 24 and</font>

377
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:37,570
again that's more specific than the

378
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:40,000
previous advertisement the problem there

379
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:42,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">is affecting the whole / 24 so you</font>

380
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,520
probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trim that that was / 32</font>

381
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:48,760
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the destination as a destination for</font>

382
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,620
if it requires a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP code where a TCP</font>

383
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,279
flag all that gets identified by our

384
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:57,670
monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> suspect allows you to</font>

385
00:16:54,279 --> 00:17:02,260
be that specific and advertise that with

386
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:03,969
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific signature its peak</font>

387
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:07,240
experiences with<font color="#CCCCCC"> folks like so this is</font>

388
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,819
new technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have vendor</font>

389
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:11,740
supporting it from monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> and from</font>

390
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,480
routing perspective so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our box</font>

391
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:18,359
and we have find that in our network

392
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:21,250
testing so again we have generated like

393
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:24,129
our example that we have seen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

394
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:28,329
fixed now<font color="#E5E5E5"> but up just stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

395
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:30,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">find them in the on lab we we have</font>

396
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:32,350
generated multiple destinations for

397
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:34,750
signatures and try to deploy them to the

398
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,730
devices but what happened is instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

399
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,130
mitigating that a specific signature

400
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:43,179
averaging got mitigated or destination

401
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:45,370
source so that got fixed another thing

402
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:47,559
was as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you were deploying</font>

403
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,360
clothes peg to the device was being nap

404
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:51,370
differently into the router save you

405
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,059
were mitigating port 80 you were really

406
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:59,169
mitigating<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 4000 so that didn't</font>

407
00:17:55,059 --> 00:18:01,440
really make sense right but things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

408
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:04,270
were kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of discovered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> during the lab</font>

409
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,720
testing and all that other limitation

410
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:10,030
that we have seen is reporting and it's

411
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,030
starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get improved that the</font>

412
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:16,178
devices the router report query action

413
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:18,280
accurately the dynamic<font color="#CCCCCC"> filter because</font>

414
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:20,890
really full spec it's a dynamic filter

415
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,660
that gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> install into the device the</font>

416
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,679
problem is a generating like<font color="#CCCCCC"> seefeld</font>

417
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,450
data or stuff like that will try

418
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:28,970
work with our vendors to get more in

419
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,840
reporting techniques to be able to graph

420
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:35,179
that and have a better tool for our

421
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,559
network operators because that's the

422
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:41,269
main requirement how do I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

423
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:43,009
mitigation is it went through as soon as

424
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:44,690
you mitigate the traffic is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

425
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:46,999
stop or how you know for how long and

426
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:51,340
all that so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to to get those</font>

427
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:55,279
counters into a better graphical

428
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:57,499
reporting tool planning and testing

429
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,840
again we did lab tests<font color="#CCCCCC"> inducing traffic</font>

430
00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:03,049
generators with certain flows the

431
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:07,668
specific signatures<font color="#CCCCCC"> dscp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called tcp</font>

432
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:10,090
flags to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to identify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

433
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:12,409
were too and then what we did is

434
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:14,860
mitigated with armor so basically that

435
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:18,860
what our lab testing and our lab

436
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:21,918
deployment feels like works we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

437
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:24,740
impressed the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it helps to us to</font>

438
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,919
do a faster response into the network so

439
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:30,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think the main key here is flows</font>

440
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:35,119
picked by itself is kind of a filter it

441
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:36,980
doesn't really give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flexibility</font>

442
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:38,928
like it's like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal static filter I</font>

443
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:41,960
think the main thing is to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

444
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:44,720
traffic analyzer in front of it if you

445
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,820
analyze the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

446
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,490
you're getting attacked flows back we'll

447
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,649
make a lot of sense again<font color="#CCCCCC"> a control</font>

448
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,269
deployment we only started with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pearson</font>

449
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,189
transit and using the community

450
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:58,990
architecture to make sure that we're

451
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:01,639
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to specifically</font>

452
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,529
mitigate where we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mitigate not</font>

453
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:06,830
trying to deploy those pic or on the

454
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:10,960
network because there's no need<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

455
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:12,300
only coming from a certain entry point

456
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font>

457
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:17,520
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to go through some of the</font>

458
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,139
lab environments that we had and some of

459
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,720
the stuff they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think very interesting</font>

460
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">too we verify what something called</font>

461
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,180
route instance and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate-limiting so</font>

462
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,280
full spec can also help to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

463
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,380
in this example you're going to see that

464
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have again the internet and our</font>

465
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,210
aggregate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Pearson transits but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

466
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:39,780
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> their a VPN called the cleaning VPN</font>

467
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,760
or and then I have a device called air

468
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,190
the cleaning station<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a firewall</font>

469
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,470
router I mean in the lab was really a

470
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:49,050
router so but it can be a cleaning

471
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,990
station and its advertising a default

472
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:55,830
route to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> brf so the intention of</font>

473
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:59,970
this is if we get a certain signature or

474
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:01,949
attack or to a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> network device to</font>

475
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:03,810
be able to use full spec in this case

476
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,720
we're using only a router to generate

477
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:08,340
this flows back advertisement but what

478
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,410
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to generate that</font>

479
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:14,220
signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain destination but I'm</font>

480
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:17,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to attach or tag that with a route</font>

481
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,470
instance and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a vrf route</font>

482
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,180
target in what happens is that that

483
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:24,600
router the pier router is going to

484
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:26,400
import<font color="#E5E5E5"> that traffic into that vrf very</font>

485
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,560
interesting that since<font color="#CCCCCC"> i already have</font>

486
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,300
the default route in that BRF is going

487
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,990
to automatically start by<font color="#CCCCCC"> varying that</font>

488
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:35,940
traffic to that device that<font color="#CCCCCC"> device is</font>

489
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:38,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">also participated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on a normal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eye before</font>

490
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,590
network to another interface so what

491
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:44,040
happens he has a default<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to</font>

492
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:47,159
the other network so what comes out

493
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:49,649
green teen or whatever but a idea is

494
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,110
that that device can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be some</font>

495
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:54,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">type of scrubbing tool or a mechanism to</font>

496
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:57,840
kind of a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> signature of traffic</font>

497
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,960
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us it was only a router</font>

498
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,209
but it's open for any other application

499
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,940
again another thing was to create the

500
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:09,210
rate-limiting and I pin out that blinds

501
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:12,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">vary but that's the idea we can rate</font>

502
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:14,220
limit to the traffic so other

503
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,320
applications I don't know prolly there's

504
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,730
some type of

505
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,590
alert or an anomaly that we're not sure

506
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:21,630
that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to medicate it or really we</font>

507
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,639
want to troll<font color="#CCCCCC"> throttle the traffic</font>

508
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,130
because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know email or something</font>

509
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,930
like that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can still rate limit that</font>

510
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:32,460
and do some type of scrubbing it is

511
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:34,560
necessary so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to say</font>

512
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,720
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that box I just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show</font>

513
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,440
more kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of application that can be</font>

514
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,150
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> soon so what is missing I think</font>

515
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,490
one of the main piece of multi-vendor

516
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:47,250
support I think have heard some people

517
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:49,200
interesting of deploying flows back but

518
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:52,320
you have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the previous lives we</font>

519
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,240
talk about junos and and and that kind

520
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,550
of limits a little bit the deployment of

521
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,670
flows back I think it's a good idea to

522
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:03,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">have all the vendor starting to</font>

523
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:06,240
participate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this draft again in</font>

524
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">Panetta because our current meta unit</font>

525
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,900
per bob i think we add<font color="#E5E5E5"> more features</font>

526
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:16,230
into the flow spec advertisements it

527
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:18,120
going to open to more applications right

528
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,940
now it's kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trick to a certain</font>

529
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:27,149
destination and force prefix but what if

530
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:30,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do more kind of thinking more of</font>

531
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:33,750
a prefix list where if you get a botnet

532
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:35,550
from different so that it forces you can

533
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,790
you generate the dynamic perfect is

534
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:42,180
where it gets applied to 22 flows back

535
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:44,010
and have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better mitigation technique I</font>

536
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,230
mean these are things opened that we

537
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:49,470
have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of think that makes sense and</font>

538
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:51,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think in the same thing as we are we</font>

539
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,340
try to report better in the mid

540
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,379
mitigation techniques I mean if you have

541
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,949
the mitigation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> you kindness if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

542
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,570
have the alert and you mitigate that you

543
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:02,730
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to also have the report</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

544
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:04,560
how long the vindication is continuing

545
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:09,390
to happen and then if you want to remove

546
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,919
the filter later other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> too is do</font>

547
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:13,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have kind of an automatic</font>

548
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">type of medication I think automatic</font>

549
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,370
makes a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people nervous you don't</font>

550
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:20,040
want to have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> device</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to automatic</font>

551
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:22,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight your network but if we start</font>

552
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,889
trusting more and is<font color="#CCCCCC"> supporting to get</font>

553
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,830
better in there

554
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:28,330
they're anomaly detection prolly that's

555
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,889
going to make sense in the future when

556
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:35,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">network starts growing and growing</font>

557
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:36,490
faster so bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean another thing I</font>

558
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,910
was talking is to have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of</font>

559
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:43,720
signatures repository where you already

560
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:45,880
have well known<font color="#E5E5E5"> at flows that already</font>

561
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,550
kind of going to create some type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> war</font>

562
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:51,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">mordidas flow why not have that already</font>

563
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:55,810
kind of being automatic install in your

564
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:58,570
device again that's kind of things that

565
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:03,520
we think it can happen but who<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

566
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:05,260
prolly is crazy talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is missing</font>

567
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,139
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> into carrier support I think it</font>

568
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:11,860
why do we allow their peers to advertise

569
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:14,080
those big wipe it makes sense why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not I</font>

570
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,689
will appear that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting attacked or</font>

571
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,610
peer through our connection whining what

572
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,740
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't generate a full spec route</font>

573
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,810
and mitigating<font color="#E5E5E5"> our network it's open</font>

574
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,280
again to questions uh what if that

575
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:27,460
creates a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of oddities in our</font>

576
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:30,790
customers I now appear network thanks to

577
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,770
us so that's a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

578
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:35,050
I mean it makes sense if we can allow

579
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:36,940
other peers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> mitigate in our</font>

580
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:38,800
networking we can do the same to others

581
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:43,720
that can probably open to a better

582
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:45,909
relationship with them again change the

583
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,150
specific signature feels on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the</font>

584
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:52,240
flows back on the flow things if you

585
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:54,610
have a certain alert that is being

586
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,170
generated with a certain dscp code why

587
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:58,090
not change it to best effort or

588
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:01,330
sometimes those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we think</font>

589
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:06,000
they are valuable for us in the future

590
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:09,460
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> continuing to use flows back um so</font>

591
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">just to talk about our recommendations</font>

592
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,680
of people are thinking to use flows<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick</font>

593
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,030
network on operators<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's a to</font>

594
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:21,010
consider right now a single vendor

595
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:22,540
support if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this on your peers</font>

596
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:25,629
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> trans</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and aggregate and I think</font>

597
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,870
makes sense to already deployed another

598
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,930
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:36,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">USB</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> EP is kind of uh not that secure or</font>

601
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,489
depends on how you're going to deploy it

602
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:39,559
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to use only one router</font>

603
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:41,180
factory in your network well then that's

604
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:42,770
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that secure right if the rubber</font>

605
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,410
scepter goes down you're going to lose

606
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:50,059
all your full spec medication another

607
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:51,440
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most important thing and</font>

608
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:53,660
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that full spec by</font>

609
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,580
itself it's a normal filtering dynamic

610
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,770
filter it makes a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very good</font>

611
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,510
useful for deployment but didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

612
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:01,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to analyze the traffic I think</font>

613
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:04,059
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important key to make</font>

614
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,380
full spec to make sense in the network

615
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:08,870
again it's a low-cost appointment right

616
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,850
now if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> already have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the gear I think</font>

617
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,309
it's a good thing you guys start looking

618
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:16,459
at it and try a new lab testing first

619
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:20,330
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it makes sense and again I think</font>

620
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:22,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">we I can say the response to mitigate</font>

621
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> faster it's too</font>

622
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:26,090
requires engagement of the security

623
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,309
operations center we cannot go and

624
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:31,010
mitigate automatically we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

625
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:32,928
engage sometimes the operator the

626
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,250
customer whoever owns that network to

627
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:36,500
make sure that we're going to mitigate

628
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,900
correctly but a lead we don't have to

629
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,820
worry about configurations in and

630
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,770
creating the filters or the certain

631
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,740
configuration or strip to the point 0 on

632
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:47,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think again those big</font>

633
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:50,720
offers you the granularity<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything does</font>

634
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:53,020
key theme for flows pick up it's open

635
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,020
for questions

636
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,080
hi there Roland Donovan<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco i have</font>

637
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">three quick questions for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you if that's</font>

638
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay the first question is and i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

639
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,810
give all three questions you can answer

640
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:09,540
them the first question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when you talk</font>

641
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,610
about policy like prefix listing things

642
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,920
like that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you thinking about perhaps</font>

643
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:15,959
whitelisting certain types of things

644
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,810
from being mitigated and things of that

645
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:21,330
sort on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second question I have for</font>

646
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:24,149
you is when you talk about automatic

647
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:26,760
response are you proposing a fully

648
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:30,360
automated system as opposed to operator

649
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:32,580
assisted automation and then the third

650
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is you also raised</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

651
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,960
possibility of inter provider

652
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:39,600
Communications of mitigation information

653
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,990
have you held any initial talks with

654
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:47,250
other SPS and if so on what were what

655
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:49,260
was the response there thank you well

656
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:52,200
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer the another first</font>

657
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:57,300
one answer to lift it to after the first

658
00:28:52,200 --> 00:29:01,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the we have not engaged any of our</font>

659
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,790
peers so or that to do this type of

660
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,110
mitigation it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only something that we</font>

661
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">think in the future can probably make</font>

662
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:14,699
sense if everybody starts working with

663
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:16,950
flows pic so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> answers I mean</font>

664
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:20,280
we are only proposing right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> the gap</font>

665
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:22,770
can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future that's what I think it</font>

666
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:26,160
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be helpful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but right now it's not we</font>

667
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:29,030
don't have engage anyone the other one

668
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:32,250
was do automatic medication and I think

669
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:34,230
it's also an idea that we think we

670
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:38,160
already have the data being<font color="#E5E5E5"> collected by</font>

671
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:40,140
net force if Lodi or s flow and and we

672
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:44,190
start trusting more to that information

673
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:46,360
why not possibly try to apply that out

674
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,340
of medication with a

675
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,990
with this producing flows / 12 or

676
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:54,340
devices but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again we have not really</font>

677
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,950
generated anything automatic right now

678
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:59,290
everything right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it's two operated</font>

679
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:01,330
by person and it's two engages other

680
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,370
groups to make sure that the the

681
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:07,169
mitigation is going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> accurate and</font>

682
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:09,969
we're going to do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> false positive</font>

683
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:12,010
medications and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other question</font>

684
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,780
I had was all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was actually our</font>

685
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,520
distributors I mean let me answer the

686
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,430
white listing a question first actually

687
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,720
there are folks that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know that</font>

688
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,340
we've seen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are looking at a point</font>

689
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,470
and what they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is apply</font>

690
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,020
exclusion policies for things that they

691
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:27,850
might do like you know like you know

692
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,220
scrubber guard kind of mitigation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

693
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,899
sort of thing and so they could forward

694
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,400
traffic on that they know to know to be

695
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,530
legitimate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not have to consume</font>

696
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,770
resources on some you know some Deepak

697
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:40,060
and mitigation device to you know for

698
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that before those micro flows and</font>

699
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:45,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">network transport layer attributes</font>

700
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:46,690
whatever so yes is the answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

701
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question I had was again</font>

702
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,140
about the prefix list are you thinking

703
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">about like whitelisting certain types of</font>

704
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,710
things or what did you mean by the

705
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,760
policy and prefix last statement that

706
00:30:53,710 --> 00:31:01,710
you said<font color="#E5E5E5"> was currently missing today I</font>

707
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:08,129
think I think that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea to kind of</font>

708
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:11,650
to do that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I again there's only</font>

709
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:15,580
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of desk just a whitelist listening</font>

710
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:18,280
that certain anomaly of that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

711
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that will be but i assume didn't got the</font>

712
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,470
question right though you mean the

713
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,209
policy apply that or<font color="#E5E5E5"> or in one of your</font>

714
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:26,650
slides you said specifically one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

715
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:28,780
things that you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see in future</font>

716
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:31,810
floats book implementations had to do

717
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,280
with policy statements in prefix list

718
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:35,139
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was wondering what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

719
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,210
application for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is it just white ah</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thoughts in there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well right now</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's kind of the signature of flows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pic</font>

722
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:45,640
it's a destination and a source prefix

723
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:49,660
but what<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get an anomaly coming</font>

724
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:52,090
from a lot of sources you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to create</font>

725
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:54,659
for each one a specific flows back why

726
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:56,009
not to allow a prefix list that

727
00:31:54,659 --> 00:32:00,389
pull that to be able to do the

728
00:31:56,009 --> 00:32:02,609
mitigation I think that's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

729
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:04,678
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to create a full</font>

730
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:07,949
spec if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten different sources</font>

731
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:09,749
or different ports so you kind of want

732
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:12,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to kind of use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a regular</font>

733
00:32:09,749 --> 00:32:14,549
expressions or a prefix list to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

734
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,940
to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so so that's something</font>

735
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:23,908
that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be very helpful for</font>

736
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:25,950
continuing this yep jean-christophe so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

737
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:27,899
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have more comments than</font>

738
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:30,210
questions but I'll certainly welcome the

739
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:33,330
feedback i like to hear from you about

740
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:35,489
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> though the one concern that I sort</font>

741
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:38,989
of had is not so much that's bgp and bgp

742
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:41,099
is insecure per se but that it gets the

743
00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:43,169
deterrent is if it's still transitive if

744
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:45,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">i understand the protocol correctly that</font>

745
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:47,070
this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets passed around and</font>

746
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:48,869
the routing tables<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe such a big</font>

747
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:50,549
problem with your example that seems

748
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:52,529
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really nice application of flows</font>

749
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:56,190
Beckett it seems to fit<font color="#CCCCCC"> in perfectly</font>

750
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:57,809
with things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arbor does but</font>

751
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,859
passing that around the routing tables

752
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,960
particularly the public Internet routing

753
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:03,178
table as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well from a research</font>

754
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,409
perspective I certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an interest</font>

755
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:06,389
in this I think it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be really</font>

756
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:07,499
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to collect this a trout</font>

757
00:33:06,389 --> 00:33:08,549
views I think there'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

758
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:10,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting things that should get out</font>

759
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:12,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that but it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the security</font>

760
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:13,649
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP is necessarily problem but I</font>

761
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:15,689
guess I'm a little bit concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

762
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:17,119
the stability if it's widely deployed

763
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,639
and I'm wondering what sorts of

764
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,418
applications you've seen yet between

765
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:25,168
provider and if there have been any

766
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:26,549
studies to that effect there yeah you

767
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:29,129
know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way to think of this is</font>

768
00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:32,580
much like other<font color="#E5E5E5"> NRI attributes such as</font>

769
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:34,379
VPN and you you know today you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> within</font>

770
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,689
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it certainly would show</font>

771
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:38,070
up in refuse at least at Hope and you'd

772
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:40,919
expect the same if you did have

773
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:42,269
bilateral agreements with your peers so

774
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:44,940
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that this is something</font>

775
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:47,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">that would be a you know transitive bgg</font>

776
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,929
attribute that would make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it into rap</font>

777
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:52,139
views I think it's much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more akin to</font>

778
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:55,289
what providers today are doing with VPNs

779
00:33:52,139 --> 00:34:01,449
and other sorts of non transitive bgp

780
00:33:55,289 --> 00:34:05,300
attributes and address families Randy

781
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:07,070
Randy Bush<font color="#E5E5E5"> i J um I'll leave his</font>

782
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:11,270
imagination to everybody else what I

783
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:15,380
think of more bgp and adding more bgp

784
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:17,300
speakers to my network and especially

785
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:20,000
when they're speaking in new and strange

786
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:24,669
tongues but what I'd really my real

787
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,590
question is I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see in the</font>

788
00:34:24,668 --> 00:34:32,989
relevant literature section of the paper

789
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:38,630
a discussion of the Floyd Bell oven at

790
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:41,928
all push back stuff and where the

791
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:44,450
decision was of what of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take and</font>

792
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:48,980
one of that not to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I think</font>

793
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:53,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's critical to what you can do for</font>

794
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:54,889
ddos mitigation and since that's five

795
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:57,530
years old and I'm kind of disappointed

796
00:34:54,889 --> 00:35:01,279
its lack of progress and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a long</font>

797
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:03,080
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Victor yes so I'll comment someone</font>

798
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,620
asks you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your first comment actually</font>

799
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,060
the the alternative of potentially

800
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,799
running another protocol and having<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

801
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,630
debug that and so forth is kind of a

802
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,240
trade-off and of course that's for the

803
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:17,090
network operator to decide and then it's

804
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,859
for the pushback stuff um so you know

805
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:20,450
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dinner</font>

806
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,310
implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know of three</font>

807
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:25,250
implementations of this and it's

808
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:26,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually not an idea or working group</font>

809
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,760
document at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment if that's what</font>

810
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,160
you're asking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that versus pushback</font>

811
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,440
stuff never managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do anything in</font>

812
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,390
the IETF like most things let's let's

813
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,460
forget the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok night air by force I was</font>

814
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:40,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">wondering I just meant the actual there</font>

815
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:43,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">were actual publish papers on that and I</font>

816
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:45,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">just would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

817
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:48,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">very well thought out stuff i'm not</font>

818
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,940
saying this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not all I'm saying is in</font>

819
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:53,120
the literature references section of

820
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:55,790
this I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand how the to</font>

821
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:58,160
meet and and what's good and what's bad

822
00:35:55,790 --> 00:36:00,230
and why this is better I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

823
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,049
it's worse I don't know I'm just saying

824
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,850
I'd like to be able to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> those more</font>

825
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:06,860
visibly yeah I think that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

826
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:15,230
worthwhile effort to undertake

827
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:17,350
so any other questions thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

828
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">much</font>
