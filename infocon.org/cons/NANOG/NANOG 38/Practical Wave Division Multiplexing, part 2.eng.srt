00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,870
good morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh this is a talk</font>

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:09,719
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> wgm which is a technology to allow</font>

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:14,160
more getting more capacity to a local

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:16,500
single strand of dark fiber and it's a

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,420
continuation of a our previous talk at

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous conference but if you have</font>

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">missed that one don't worry we'll just</font>

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">cover what was missing what we covered</font>

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,830
before so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is w DM and val is good</font>

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,140
double<font color="#E5E5E5"> G M is really a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> solution to a</font>

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:39,449
problem of getting high capacity

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:48,300
transport over a short range or metro

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:52,230
area network<font color="#CCCCCC"> Metro as method is real a</font>

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">distance of about 100 kilometers where</font>

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,898
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the technology without</font>

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:04,710
having to use amplifiers how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> wgm</font>

17
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:07,320
work it is essentially sending multiple

18
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:11,580
independent streams of data over one

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:15,179
single mode fiber why is it by double G

20
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:18,060
M is very popular because the cost of

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,740
dark fiber is fairly low it is

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,860
comparable to the cost of a single lead

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,830
circuit and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> capacity of a dark fiber</font>

24
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:31,340
is essentially unlimited and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as limit</font>

25
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:33,929
and it can scale up to based on the

26
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:38,670
equipment<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you put into terminates</font>

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,740
dark fiber so you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not paying if you</font>

28
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,899
scale from to give it to thank you give

29
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,399
it to 20 gigabit you are not paying more

30
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,710

do wyd wavelength division<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiplexing</font>

35
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:06,750
basically have<font color="#E5E5E5"> LX and ZX optics and two</font>

same but over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same fiber or you can</font>

44
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:33,620
do den 5th division multiplexing for 10

45
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:39,680
gig Ethernet and you could get up to 64

46
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:42,670
10 gigabit channels why is WM very

47
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,250
interesting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who has</font>

48
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:48,679
operational experience and trying to

49
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,040
build a network on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-cost basically</font>

50
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,700
you can grow this when you have a system

51
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,030
which is gwm two channels you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can add</font>

52
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:03,399
more filters and extract more

53
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:10,580
wavelengths and scale it up as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you grow</font>

54
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:13,100
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an example of a of a filter set</font>

55
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:17,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">up for one of one of the configuration</font>

56
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:21,260
first we have 13 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 50 splitter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

57
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,150
and the 13 10 13 10 and goes to another

58
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:28,000
scooter that extract selects for bang

59
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:31,930
bang links and as a result in you have

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to 10 gigabit channels and 8gb channels</font>

61
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:39,620
over a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> pair of fiber so once you</font>

62
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,130
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> reached the capacity of the</font>

63
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,650
standard

64
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:47,160
of the standard system how can you scale

65
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,680
it to get even more and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

66
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,260
subject of realtors presentation the

67
00:03:49,680 --> 00:04:05,940
more exotic and more advanced techniques

68
00:03:52,260 --> 00:04:08,519
how to get additional capacity well the

69
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:16,680
van technology is<font color="#E5E5E5"> LX four and a large</font>

70
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:20,280
coolers you can do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can add 10</font>

71
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:24,390
gigabit channel using LX for wavelength

72
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:29,039
what is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 x4 is is actually in</font>

73
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:32,430
by itself is<font color="#CCCCCC"> WDM multiplexed 2.5 GB</font>

74
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,230
channels there are four channels and the

75
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,090
useful thing is that it doesn't

76
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,630
interfere with a lot of wavelengths so

77
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:42,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can use LX four and L are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

78
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,940
same pair and essentially you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

79
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:49,980
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same pair</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tory gigabits instead</font>

80
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:51,920
of 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> gigabit ethernet what is the what</font>

81
00:04:49,980 --> 00:05:01,050
is the what is an interleaver

82
00:04:51,920 --> 00:05:04,500
interleaver you can have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it easy it</font>

83
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:09,150
split it split I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sorry i disown</font>

84
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:12,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">slides into rivers add capacity by</font>

85
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:17,179
essentially taking taking the two

86
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:23,810
channels and splitting them based on

87
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:23,810
even odd even odd spacing

88
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:43,820
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> even X for example if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a if</font>

89
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:46,640
you have a system with cwm the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cwm</font>

90
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:49,219
channel is approximately<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nanometers</font>

91
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,659
wide you can we can put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into two of</font>

92
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,720
those channels into the same interleaver

93
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:59,330
and you can extract<font color="#E5E5E5"> one channel which</font>

94
00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:01,910
has both both data and each of those is

95
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,460
about half of the light<font color="#E5E5E5"> level what does</font>

96
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:09,470
the circulator so circulator essentially

97
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:11,390
a uses polarization to transmit on the

98
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,260
same wavelengths in both directions so

99
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:17,180
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a system that used two pairs</font>

100
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:22,190
of fiber you can put the same system on

101
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:24,590
ace on a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> strand of fiber using</font>

102
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:29,300
the fact that polarization can be can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

103
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:33,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to separate light going on</font>

104
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:37,310
different only different directions on

105
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:40,310
this on this fiber so the Cavett's of

106
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:42,890
doing this technology to<font color="#CCCCCC"> my knowledge</font>

107
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:46,419
there is nobody doing commercial systems

108
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:48,830
based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> internal livers or LX 4lr or</font>

109
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:50,990
circulators so you have pretty much on

110
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:55,070
your own as far as building a complete

111
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:58,580
system these certain technologies for

112
00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:00,979
example these circulators you depend on

113
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,979
the limited internal reflection of the

114
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:05,300
fiber and this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

115
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:11,900
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to worry when you're doing</font>

116
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:13,760
just single directional<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet if the</font>

117
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,099
fiber of the splices have a significant

118
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,890
internal reflection you may get<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own</font>

119
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:21,080
signal reflected back and you would get

120
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">linked to itself and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before your</font>

121
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,669
port will get disabled because it will

122
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:30,190
detect link so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to attenuate</font>

123
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:30,190
signal to prevent this from happening

124
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:36,350
the doing doing this configuration

125
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:40,790
requires a somewhat expensive equipment

126
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:43,070
to test it and to

127
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,980
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something get something useful</font>

128
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,780
out of it the spectrum analyzer the

129
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,870
broadband light sources all that stuff

130
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,640
is not very cheap<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course what</font>

131
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,850
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen if the engineer for building</font>

132
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:58,370
system gets hit by bus you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know build</font>

133
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:03,980
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how the</font>

134
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:09,050
system works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how to how to maintain</font>

135
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:11,810
it if it breaks what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so where</font>

136
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:14,180
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the stuff there are number of</font>

137
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:18,970
companies who produce optical components

138
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:22,040
AC<font color="#CCCCCC"> Avonex attack the components itself</font>

139
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,290
somewhat expensive but the best place to

140
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:29,000
buy event and there are couple companies

141
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:31,190
who build the components based on your

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,729
specification for example Alex<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4lr</font>

143
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:40,070
splitter the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> that made it</font>

144
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:41,660
forested volume market so if you have

145
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:46,810
any questions I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to manage</font>
