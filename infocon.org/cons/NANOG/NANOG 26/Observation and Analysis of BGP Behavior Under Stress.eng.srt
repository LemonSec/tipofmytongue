our observation that these spikes were

if we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not careful when we learn</font>

finally we can conclude that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

436
00:27:55,110 --> 00:28:00,270
mentally increase the congestion the

438
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:10,020
work great our empirical observations

439
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:14,270
seem to support their conclusion and

440
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:18,750
this the fourth related study is site of

441
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:23,240
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> men a landfill time they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze</font>

444
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,379
identified some characteristics that we

445
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:38,309
see in this study<font color="#E5E5E5"> however their names</font>

447
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:45,899
in test lab environment our main purpose

448
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:53,510
is to diagnose problems in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

449
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:57,470
traces this is a list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> references for</font>

450
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:57,470
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard metal</font>

451
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:16,928
so glad I just pasta rate wrong thing

452
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:20,139
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in the event of something</font>

453
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:22,480
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninda rolling out you may not have</font>

454
00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:26,439
actually been observing the BGT session

455
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:30,100
dropping from congestion per se but it

456
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:32,679
may have been an overly active engineer

457
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:35,168
at a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP or set of ISPs going</font>

458
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:37,090
oh my god I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> this whole bunch of</font>

459
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:39,009

<font color="#CCCCCC">it are they flooding us are they</font>

461
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:44,049
attacking us let's tear down the session

462
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:45,879
and see what happens oh yeah in another

463
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:49,690
way let's bring it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that's also</font>

464
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:54,699
one possible scenario yeah it could be

465
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:56,710
congestion or router reboot<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I'm</font>

466
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:59,470
actually postulating that that in a lot

467
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:01,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these cases it's the humans that</font>

470
00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:08,769
weather the storm better than if we as

471
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,690
engineers start getting involved in

472
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:12,999
booking our fingers at things to maybe

473
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:16,450
try to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> better yes I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dis</font>

being heaved so it's uninteresting for

ops 2 he said it though of course if you

485
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,619
are silly enough to allow fingers on

486
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:52,049
your router's instead of contributing

487
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:52,049
things automatically anything can<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font>

488
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:57,519
yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> minor comment so you focused</font>

00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:00,100
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spike but it's not about the</font>

spikes really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if you looked at</font>

491
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:05,889
the withdrawals are after cleaning up

492
00:31:03,009 --> 00:31:07,840
the data the interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is the</font>

493
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:10,360
sustained level of withdrawals it's

494
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,320
about factor of<font color="#CCCCCC"> five was so higher than</font>

normal

496
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,000
going for about 24 hours and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

497
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,400
it's quite feasible it may be several

498
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,440
thousand networks there's no more really

499
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,270
involved another thing that's

500
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,880
interesting is I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you looked</font>

504
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:39,520
similar general behavior too so I think

505
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:42,010
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we're digging in is not</font>

506
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,650
short of you know to filter out what you

507
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:47,650
call experts meaning of updates that do

not change<font color="#CCCCCC"> i pierce path attribute but</font>

509
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,480
to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> Peter what exactly caused it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

510
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:55,330
why do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have so significantly higher</font>

511
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:57,730
level about a debate that reflect

512
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:00,790
internal changes in areas rather than

513
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:02,680
our external did you bypass so I think

514
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:05,649
the student had a clear-cut answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

515
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:07,180
what exactly has been going on yes I

516
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,220
want to stress up the spikes don't

517
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:12,460
matter here it's the alleged confession

518
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:14,890
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tray for the entire forest yeah</font>

519
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:17,230
we're looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> one side partners that</font>

520
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:21,580
we shared a story with trash like you

521
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:24,460
are saying their own entrance into the

522
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:27,909
truck and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite considerably yeah</font>

523
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:31,420
we don't can tell that there's aircraft

524
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:34,030
Kentucky writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> instability but we want</font>

525
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:37,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know whether the instability occurred</font>

526
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:40,030
all over the internet or are they

527
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:43,360
contributed by a small set of the

528
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:50,110
network or not I agree it's it's at

529
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:52,929
several thousand networks yeah yes and

530
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:58,169
one more clarification I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make is</font>

531
00:32:52,930 --> 00:33:00,940
that our web-based worm<font color="#CCCCCC"> should analyze</font>

532
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:04,780
widespread<font color="#CCCCCC"> damage to the particularity</font>

533
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:08,320
impractical the next room might make<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun</font>

534
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:13,149
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we shouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

535
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:15,960
concerned about project knee problems in

536
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:19,150
fact one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reasons we look at this</font>

537
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,980
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is trying to identify what are</font>

538
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:26,090
the weaknesses in the chi Chi that

539
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:28,880
would have to improve our flicks mobile

540
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:32,449
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> platico to be more resilient to</font>

541
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,540
the next royal attack so as we have
