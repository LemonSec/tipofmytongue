157
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:36,729
random scanning of the address space so

<font color="#E5E5E5">just click a 32-bit number out of thin</font>

175
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,719

to flooding would use flooding of the

209
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:02,709
would just sit there however we did as I

mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> six and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number generator</font>

running bro the intrusion detection

00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:23,250
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen similar sorts of stuff from</font>

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:39,610
it's the data that I have easily in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

224
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:47,889
turning up how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many new posts per minute</font>

232
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:15,889
at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point we're seeing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1800 new host</font>

234
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:26,540
we're seeing nearly what I'm always blow

00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:31,269
this map 30 30 every second host women

236
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:34,639
seen before it was really amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

237
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:37,759
there's also this pattern was very sort

238
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:42,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">of surprising or striking peak goes up a</font>

240
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:54,889
a population that is being saturated ok

00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:59,628
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> far from just at OBO we saw more than</font>

243
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:04,279
worked out some of the biases involved

00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:08,329
in these<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network telescopes and from his</font>

00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:19,279
that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 68</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hours interesting thing about</font>

248
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:21,049
these worms is that the larger the

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,009
population<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bastard is spreading</font>

250
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:26,779
because the worm is basically

251
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:29,630
distributing out the work of spreading

252
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:32,880
amongst all its numbers

253
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:35,010
so that night it turns from the 19th of

254
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,620
the 20th the worm was supposed to go in

255
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:40,380
flood the flooding didn't work because

256
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:44,850
the address<font color="#E5E5E5"> had been changed and so the</font>

257
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:46,589
worm does so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really a pretty</font>

258
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,660
amazing partner<font color="#CCCCCC"> hanging on the 19th is</font>

259
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:53,730

260

gone on the planet and whether one is

261
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,390
dead some of these there's a huge us out

262
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:59,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">there with clocks that are really really</font>

263
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:01,800
far off and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that it's</font>

264
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,290
the 20s they think it's September may or

265
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,599
whatever or just really a July and so

266
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:08,640
they'll keep going but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's great fewer</font>

267
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,240
than most of them how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just fix one of</font>

268
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,890
these come August first to start

269
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,110
spreading the worm again and all the

270
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,209
cooks all right host the correct clocks

271
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:23,510
are again vulnerable come honest person

272
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:30,268
and sure enough that's what we get so

273
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:34,649
now so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a midnight pacific time</font>

274
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:37,800
the ones actually based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> greenwich</font>

275
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:39,660
time so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know eight hours back or so</font>

276
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,620
it starts to spread again and it's clear

277
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:45,719
we're seeing the same spread some sort

278
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,029
of growth patterns before we did get a

279
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,589
secondary effect which is in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> evening</font>

280
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:52,829
machines are turned on and they get

281
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:55,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">infected as well now the wait here</font>

282
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:59,279
though is quite a bit lower and you can

283
00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:02,969
you can see that you know roughly half

284
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,860
the machines got patched in the less

285
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:09,240
than two weeks between us from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

286
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:13,680
incident free days later we get code<font color="#E5E5E5"> red</font>

they would get infected that's a masc

319
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,279
and then it would also go and look these

route backwards left behind the previous

2 and F F in D pretty I left the one

that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty clever now and and it</font>

324
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,519
also highlights how these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things in a</font>

325
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:10,959
certain sense start to form<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ecosystem</font>

326
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,940
one of the really interesting things

327
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,729
about is because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was multimodal has</font>

328
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,769
jumped across firewalls there's sites

329
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,680
that didn't have any problem of code red

330
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:22,750
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> or two that ninda ravished because</font>

331
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,750
it was much<font color="#CCCCCC"> better coughing fire off do</font>

332
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:28,589
these email tricks and this put up the

333
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,730
poison page on the web server<font color="#E5E5E5"> trick</font>

334
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:33,399
another interesting thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninda is</font>

335
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:35,709
the payload is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> known I mean it's</font>

336
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,329
understood how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it spreads exactly what</font>

337
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:39,760
it does whether there's some time on in

338
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,920
there it's just not known and that's

339
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,920
because it takes quite a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources</font>

340
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,319
to

341
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,569
you know crawl through non-trivial

342
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:52,310
program and really determine what it

343
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:54,380
does this is the what the onset never

344
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:57,800
looked at get warrants quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> grab mrs.</font>

345
00:16:54,380 --> 00:17:00,380
connections per hour and you can see

346
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:04,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it was an enormous spike when it</font>

347
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:06,230
first came out on over 300,000

348
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,939
connections per hour coming in as its

349
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,890
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> scanned this is not taking into</font>

350
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:14,419
account other ways it's spreading this

351
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:18,890
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the scanning and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> crews reactions</font>

352
00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:21,620
blown up connections per second and with

353
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:24,770
what I find sobering about this is the

354
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:26,479
very rapid onset so at six thirty in the

355
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:31,970
morning the action starts restart

356
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,380
getting a elevated rate infections per

357
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,320
second and it takes about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half hour</font>

358
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:39,410
for it to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to full porn nearly a</font>

359
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:43,879
hundred connections per second and just

360
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:46,880
sustained as the worm spring here's a

361
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:50,720
timeline of the worms we we start with

362
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">co-read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CR v 2 or code red one july</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 19th</font>

363
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,120
huge spike and then because it stops in

364
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20th it goes it comes back of its</font>

365
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:05,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">first this is a different metric these</font>

366
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:07,820
are confirmed infected so it's we not

367
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,830
only are we scanned by some house but

368
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,168
they send over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the poison URL so we can</font>

369
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:16,720
we can tell which of the three worms it

370
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:19,580
is code wed to comes a few days<font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">one code red one dies on the twentieth</font>

373
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,260
of those because it's who comes along on

374
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:31,899
a weekly pattern<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninde comes along and</font>

now this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going this is all the way</font>

380
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:52,870
through this last summer nimba continues

381
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,490
to attack you know at<font color="#E5E5E5"> LVL we see a</font>

384
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,770
that's endemic out there the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait is</font>

385
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:06,900
going down as you can see on the other

386
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:09,670
hand color one has this resurgence and

387
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:13,180
it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> weird how it grew for now</font>

388
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:15,070
I able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure that out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but every</font>

389
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,500
month and a monthly pattern it comes

00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,090
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for a while ruined going</font>

391
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,660
through now it sort of sustains itself

392
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:26,320
at right around<font color="#E5E5E5"> two thousand different</font>

397
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,100
September's it's roughly still staying

398
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:41,980
flat so so we have proof some ecosystem

399
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,780
out there just worms cops on the trying

400
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,210
to attack and a lot of here very<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">matters</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that ok so that's what's what</font>

402
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:53,290
we've seen what we've endured and really

403
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:57,820
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> research began was thinking</font>

404
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:59,379
about better words meaning more

405
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:03,040
effective ones and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interested</font>

406
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:06,190
in this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we just threat posed</font>

by worms is really in particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

408
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:12,430
worms we're not all that well design

00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:16,360
compared to what one could and we're

410
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:18,809
concerned that it just took us hours in

411
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,758
some cases to figure out better ways

412
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:23,850

413
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:26,429
nasty he was thinking about worms will

414
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:31,529
also rapidly realize you can do a lot

415
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:34,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">better though several ideas for going</font>

416
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:35,600
faster one is when you do this random

well alarms really large so instead you

into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> schedule further one as the</font>

433
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,350
worm scale and in fact if they can tell

434
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:21,389
when they infect a host that that host

435
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,789
has already been infected then they know

436
00:21:21,389 --> 00:21:25,229
there's another instance of the worm

437
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:27,779
working their piece of the schedule in a

438
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,490
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> editing right someone all holy</font>

439
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:31,470
got here and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means someone's</font>

440
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:34,649
working the schedule right around where

441
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:38,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">I am and they're heading so again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Yuri</font>

442
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:41,879
randomized these are simple tweaks good

443
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:45,000
easy start to add

444
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,220
and yet it makes an enormous difference

445
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,730
because it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that rather than having</font>

446
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,440
you know tens of thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one copy</font>

447
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,780
is all sort of pounding on various

448
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,640
addresses at random those 10,000 are all

449
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,710
giving up the outer space into

450
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,510
essentially when 10,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the crotch</font>

451
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:05,370
spread much faster once you have this it

452
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:08,370
means when the ones big it goes really

453
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:10,919
fast but he's called upon getting big

454
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:15,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that one it's not so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to solve</font>

455
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:16,740
either so the kini observation is you

456
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:20,129
want critical mass<font color="#CCCCCC"> and critical mass is</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that big but it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not one host on</font>

00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:27,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want something significant and so</font>

460
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,580
the notion is you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> strep throat we</font>

461
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:34,170
call a hit list which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> collection of</font>

00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:35,760

465
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,960
to start from the hit list you get those

466
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,649
by brute force and then use coordinated

467
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:50,370
skinny as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go and then you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can just</font>

468
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:52,470
crunch the the modeling of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

470
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:57,470
you've got a million global hope your

471
00:22:55,290 --> 00:23:02,159
hit list is 10,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's one percent</font>

472
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:05,910
your worm scans 100 AD<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus second</font>

473
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:07,170
which is attainable is a dump watch your

478
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:23,310
that is the problem that's very fast way

479
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:25,950
faster than the hours unfortunately you

480
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:29,129
can go faster still once you think about

481
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:31,980
these hit list then the National well

482
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:34,650
how big could I hitless be is one

483
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,810
percent you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the limit can I get</font>

484
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:39,840
more and so I suppose you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the</font>

485
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:42,240
entire hitless how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it well</font>

486
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,629
I'll depends you could just brute force

487
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:49,230
in so you work out that you know size of

488

sins resets you can see if you have a

they got you I mean they they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

513
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:57,900
redundant they are divvied up the

address position<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your skin um it's a</font>

516
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:05,399
getting spread your scanning developed

517
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,889
is hitless over months and then there's

518
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,630
other ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trying to prime out the</font>

519
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,970
information you know I could

520
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:14,220
you may make guesses based on out

521
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,500
walking the DNS like building web

522
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:21,120
servers you might just get over comms

523
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,920
and look for www that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hostname you might</font>

524
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,810
see what you can get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the search</font>

525
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,660
engines they know the names of tons and

526
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:29,850
tons of what servers of course we might

527
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:34,170
just listen you know on some protocols

528
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:38,760
like pure pure you can just join in and

529
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:42,650
see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes you're a war listen to</font>

530
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:45,990
the existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> work right I have a list of</font>

533
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:54,360
there they are I've got their addresses

534
00:25:51,350 --> 00:26:00,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so suppose you can build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up this</font>

535
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:02,340
list now the game is changed and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

536
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:06,120
go really fast so you start out you've

537
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:09,419
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire list and you're going to</font>

538
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,939
each generation and take the list and

539
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:16,800
divide it up by some branching factor in

540
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:20,580
and so the first copy of the one takes

541
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:23,520
in entries off the list goes and infects

542
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:25,949
them hands than<font color="#CCCCCC"> one over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> N of the entire</font>

543
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">list and they do this the next</font>

544
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:32,910
generation 1 over N squared whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> n 2</font>

545
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:34,260
and there's ways to engineer this said

546
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:37,130
that you have to copy the list round of

547
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:40,320
the list is not actually all that big

548
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:42,030
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with failure</font>

549
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,679
and you'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of</font>

550
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:45,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">locality and you know there's a lot of</font>

551
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,770
engineering to really get this done

552
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:51,030
right and we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done that</font>

553
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:53,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">engineering but you can just do the map</font>

554
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:56,430
which is say the blanching factors 10

555
00:26:53,540 --> 00:27:00,060
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes seven generations to get</font>

556
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:01,440
10 million hose and depending how long

557
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:04,050
generation is it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a few</font>

558
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,730
seconds maybe a lot longer than that you

559
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:08,340
get tens of seconds

560
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:12,480
got your millionaire in this case

561
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:14,220
tenderloin house and then there are

562
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">other techniques we didn't explore in</font>

563
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,450
depth that we know which is one that

564
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,340
works particularly variant is

565
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,160
topological ones and these are ones that

566
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,300
use once they've infected a host they

572
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:43,350
just because of the application level

573
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:46,170
network you can track its topology and

574
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:48,360
you know what that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:52,140
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> high proportion of hits you're</font>

577
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,490
because by the records they've left in

578
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,949
the past proving that they're out there

579
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:03,180
and that this hosts you're on talks to

580
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:04,770
them if you do this topological scanning

581
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,790
then it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot less anomalous because</font>

582
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:08,940
you're making connections that have

00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:10,620
already been made<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the past and if the</font>

interconnections apologies rich you can

585
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:18,090
go really fast so the business is worse

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Moores</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worms it's in and out ok</font>

00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:22,709
where do we how do we defend against

588
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,530
this I mean it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite bad well you</font>

589
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:28,470
can build them and the time scales are

590
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:31,520
really the low human response even code

591
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:34,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">weds pretty much below human response</font>

592
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:38,070
but these where you've got at most tens

593
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:43,470
of minutes even<font color="#E5E5E5"> or just a minute or</font>

594
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:45,870
something it's a whole other game so you

595
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:49,020
need our data detectors and you need

596
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:51,270
automated response and perhaps you can

597
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,250
use deception to honey pots to slow

598
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:56,340
downloads this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard I'm going</font>

00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to turn at this point but it's also only</font>

600
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,929
half the problem was we thought of

<font color="#E5E5E5">another way to be nasty we call these</font>

contagion works now in teaching ones

603
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:11,220
like really they weren't that suppose

604
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,850
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exploits one for Webster</font>

605
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:16,610
than one for web clan and in debt so

606
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:18,810
these are attainable

607
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:22,709
you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with the server or client</font>

608
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:26,760
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there and infect it and then you</font>

609
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:28,380
just wait and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you bait maybe you</font>

610
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,360
put up some juicy content that's going

611
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,790
to bring people<font color="#CCCCCC"> your lawyers sometimes</font>

612
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,860
if you just wait and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the clients</font>

613
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:36,600
come you check and if they're vulnerable

614
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,820
to the client exploit you infect them

615
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:42,360
and then you send over both the server

616
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:44,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client exploit and then you just</font>

617
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,740
sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as the client happens</font>

618
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,240
to serve other sites it's going the

619
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,590
infection and it is going to see if

620
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,000
they're vulnerable as well and it's so

621
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infect them with the</font>

622
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,210
silver exploit and again send over both

623
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,520
the server and client exploits so the

624
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:02,430
key is here no communication patterns

625
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,240
change at all you're just parasitically

626
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:07,740
writing existing communication patterns

627
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:09,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the only change is the transfers are</font>

628
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,730
slightly larger because<font color="#E5E5E5"> now there's not</font>

629
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:15,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">only a content which you continue to to</font>

630
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:22,020
correctly propagate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's the one</font>

631
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:23,790
so how bad can this be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular was</font>

632
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,220
very sibling for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us realize peer-to-peer</font>

633
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:29,220
is just prima for this sort of infection

634
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,960
so first you may only need a single

635
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,360
exploit because the peer-to-peer of the

636
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,400
server and client are current and

637
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're basically the same thing I'm so</font>

638
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:41,310
that lowers the barrier entry the<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers</font>

639
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:44,060
are often running identical software

640
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:46,429
there's monocultures in peer-to-peer

641
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:49,230
particularly in the big big you know

642
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:51,030
highly successful interview they've

643
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,670
they're all about rich interconnection

644
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:55,530
so they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that nice apology they're</font>

645
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:58,620
used to move big files around so that

646
00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:00,930
your real worm on top of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> jpeg or</font>

647
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,909
MPEG wherever it is is going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

648
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:05,460
hard for any sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of anomaly detection</font>

649
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:07,110
system design I'm they tend not to be

650
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:11,090
mainstream so that's not you know there

651
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:13,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">are is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plugins for Nutella like</font>

656
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:27,800
got this and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> final points that</font>

657
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:30,889
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really big so here is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a large</font>

universities kazaa traffic and Marcus

659
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:37,190
this was measured a year ago back when

660
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:40,580
Marcus and kazaa both used bass track

661
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:42,440
which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> report 12 14 more business</font>

662
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,600
since moved often they tell us anything

663
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:49,610
this is port 12 14 traffic at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

664
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:52,850
university and its measured in gigabytes

665
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:55,909
a day so we the US is doing about<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

666
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:59,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a half terabytes a day of cuz off</font>

667
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:01,730
and then here's the Christmas break

668
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:05,179
everyone well students all go home and

669
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:07,520
then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> come back and yeah I'm struck</font>

670
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:09,500
at how steady this is you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

671
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:13,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have one and a half to</font>

672
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:16,820
us um that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of traffic and in</font>

673
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,280
particular suppose that you control your

00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:21,820
broken<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> University and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you earned all</font>

675
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,200
of its because our servers how many

676
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:27,800
connections this university make<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font>

00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:30,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">day to other because on servers now this</font>

678
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:32,300
is crunched<font color="#CCCCCC"> off of the November rods</font>

679
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,940
these are confirmed established

680
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:39,070
connection so TCP through handshake

681
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:41,990
completes its not scanning or anything

682
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:44,389
I'm CNN<font color="#E5E5E5"> fin so there was a it was a</font>

683
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,590
completely normal connection so i

684
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:48,500
suppose that every one of those

685
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:49,820
connections<font color="#CCCCCC"> allowed you to infect to</font>

686
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,810
maybe it would maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would depend on</font>

687
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:56,510
the exploit the first day of<font color="#E5E5E5"> november we</font>

688
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:57,889
get more than half a million new hosts

00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:00,470
we've never seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're starting</font>

690
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:03,320
the numbers the statistics so half a

691
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:07,610
million posts talk with the university

692
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:09,409
over kazaa happen really wow and then

693
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,570
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next day you know it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little over</font>

696
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,540
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> four thousand new ones we didn't</font>

697
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:22,399
see the day before and so on throughout

698
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:25,040
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> november so even near the end of</font>

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a perfect number but is roughly</font>

705
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:39,720
you get the idea this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an immense</font>

and if you had an exploit that because

ours is a monocle terms you know it's

00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:03,149
fast track there's probably two or three

715
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:06,418
flavors of it and that's it so if you

716
00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:08,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">had a an exploit you could just sit</font>

717
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:13,409
there and at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the month have</font>

718
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:16,168
nine million house does it take a month

719
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:18,179
no because you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> first day</font>

720
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:20,638
you've got half a million more servers

721
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,918
out there spreading the contagion on

722
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,210
your behalf so clearly it's not going to

723
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:26,609
take a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's probably going to be a</font>

724
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:31,859
lot faster it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> real hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to compute</font>

725
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:33,389
because you have to understand in our

726
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:37,739
connection patterns not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only at the</font>

727
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:38,700
university but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also elsewhere and and</font>

728
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:40,770
then on the other hand you might also

729
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:43,020
cheat you might you know try to decide

730
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:44,819
well we won't just passively go where

731
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,500
the user goes we're going to you know

732
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:53,190
make a few connections on our own just

733
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:57,359
to spread the word<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what we've</font>

734
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:59,940
sketched here are a number of very nasty

735
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,700
ones that we believe quite possibly can

736
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:05,069
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> built and we already outline that</font>

737
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,230
once one has this capability to get a

738
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:12,810
million<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Norma's damage</font>

739
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:14,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">um that with the lat part of the talk</font>

740
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:19,349
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what can we do about</font>

741
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:22,649
this Stewart came up with this analogy

742
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:24,390
that's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> two edged sword so the</font>

743
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:27,510
analogy is we've got a center for

744
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:30,379
disease control the US for infectious

745
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:33,240
diseases and we need the cyber

746
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,130
equivalent now the reason the analogy is

747
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,680
too slippery

748
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:39,320
and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big processes it sticks</font>

749
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,600
in people's mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Center for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Disease</font>

750
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,030
Control know that and that's a useful

751
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,620
thing for like Washington<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really does</font>

752
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:48,350
matter but you've got a tag that is

753
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:49,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to help people remember what</font>

754
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,200
you're trying to cushion on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

755
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,150
hand it's off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the lip you know</font>

756
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot that is not</font>

757
00:35:53,150 --> 00:36:01,280
at all analogous between human disease

758
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:02,900
spread and computer and this is really

759
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,350
proven a lightning rod and we've got any

760
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">hate mail on this and excusing us as you</font>

761
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:10,790
know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we want to go out and build</font>

762
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,920
this thing and no we do not but we want

763
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:14,870
very much to get a dialogue going on

764
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,030
well what should be the response and if

765
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:19,069
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in some form so I'm sort of</font>

766
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:22,130
set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up for disease control what would it</font>

767
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:24,020
look like so taking pic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind you</font>

768
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:26,540
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to this is us you know</font>

769
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:30,259
sketching what would go into such a

770
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:33,920
beast as that's we thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

771
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:36,140
we really are looking for dialogue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

772
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,300
not you know try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this happen as</font>

773
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:41,540
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> envisioned so what would you do what</font>

774
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:43,220
you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to identify outbreaks that's</font>

775
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,779
basic you want to know that the worms

776
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:50,060
out there and so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need</font>

777
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:52,340
sensors large set of sensors and some

778
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:53,840
sort of decentralized communication

779
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:57,110
mechanisms<font color="#E5E5E5"> decentralized that it can't</font>

780
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,640
be targeted that lets you take in the

781
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,920
information from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sensors and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

782
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">determinations and one idea we've been</font>

783
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:07,010
working on here is a notion called

784
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:08,330
wormholes which are distributed are you

785
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,970
basically just tunnel endpoints you

786
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:14,840
scatter throughout the network in some

787
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:16,879
fashion boxes address space and whatever

788
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,620
goes there gets routed to a honey farm

789
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,200
which is collection<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual machines</font>

790
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:23,750
running servers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're monitoring</font>

791
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,430
the honey<font color="#CCCCCC"> formal you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

792
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,170
servers in there should never<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever make</font>

793
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:29,299
an outbound connection because they're

794
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:31,580
your servers and that's not part of

795
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:34,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">their job so if and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when they do they're</font>

796
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,600
infected with a worm because that's sort

797
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:37,650
by definition something came in and

798
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:42,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">exploited the service and</font>

799
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:45,029
spread you need to rapidly understand

800
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,529
what the thing is you've got and there's

801
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:48,690
two parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us there's how does it</font>

802
00:37:46,529 --> 00:37:52,529
spread and then there's what else does

803
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:54,900
it do what's the payload so for this

804
00:37:52,529 --> 00:37:59,510
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need human experts</font>

805
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:01,559
that's just the no automated way to

806
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:03,299
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so you can do some on the</font>

807
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:05,369
spreading because you can run it in a

808
00:38:03,299 --> 00:38:07,319
lab and see what it does but for the

809
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:09,960
extra payload is going to be very

810
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:11,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand even with these</font>

811
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,650
experts is going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

812
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:16,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> instead of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> art in code</font>

813
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:20,250
obfuscation is grim for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who want</font>

814
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:25,618
to understand what the code does in

815
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:28,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular static analysis is pretty</font>

816
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:32,010
much completely defeatable by various

817
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:34,618
cooking techniques<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you need a</font>

818
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:37,440
well equipped lab and<font color="#CCCCCC"> archives computers</font>

819
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:38,789
and you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this even at</font>

820
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,930
even if it's one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> very rapid</font>

821
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:42,480
ones because you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to</font>

822
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:45,089
know what happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what do you</font>

824
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:51,750
fight infection this is the really nice

825
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,039
one you'd like ways to somehow keep the

826
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,170
worm from spreading well what that's

827
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:57,510
going to mean automated mechanisms push

828
00:38:55,170 --> 00:39:01,529
out some way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify the one and</font>

829
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:04,260
stop its traffic huge issues here over

830
00:39:01,529 --> 00:39:06,510
who controls it what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the liability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

831
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:09,660
squeeze up<font color="#E5E5E5"> Howie's Elaine is it was</font>

832
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:12,390
targeted maybe there's a model of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">emergency broadcast system where you've</font>

834
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:16,859
got automatic ways to push out

835
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:18,660
signatures and very much locally control

836
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:22,319
policy decisions as to what you do with

837
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:24,720
this signatures and then one idea here

838
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:27,089
is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> these flash burn so what if you</font>

839
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,098
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit list in advance what if you</font>

840
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:30,599
do good guys white hat go up and do the

841
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:33,359
scanning also and build up the hills

842
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:35,640
then early in a flash worm early<font color="#CCCCCC"> meaning</font>

843
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:38,130
like the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> few seconds you might</font>

844
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,960
know was good probability this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

845
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:42,420
target it's going to go out go after

846
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,990
senators and then you could do something

847
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:49,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them I'm not saying this is all</font>

848
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:53,189
easy I am saying running needs

849
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:56,130
discussion you want to track new

850
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:57,270
applications as they come analyze the

851
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,160
threat associated with those

852
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:03,710
applications it would be really nice to

853
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cos eyes what r is</font>

854
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:07,470
the deployment will whip the extent of

855
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:09,740
its deployment out of it in our

856
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:12,330

864
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:38,369
is buggy software and and you don't want

00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:40,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">to ignore that in terms of how you</font>

respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the overall threat but that's</font>

00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:48,960
a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue and so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

868
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,700
as we step this we figure out this to

869
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,119
think you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sounds hopelessly</font>

00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:57,890
hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it that's a really big thing and</font>

871
00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:00,300
how do it makes it hard is I think

talking about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> tyndall dollar threat</font>

875
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:10,439
are we talking 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> billion dollar threat</font>

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">this clearly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a threat are we talking</font>

even<font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger than that because because</font>

there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of pain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and trying to</font>

that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a big set and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then I</font>

888
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:42,299
and in down the line no that's just

889
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:44,130
going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger and bigger so if you</font>

890

take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that threat seriously and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>
