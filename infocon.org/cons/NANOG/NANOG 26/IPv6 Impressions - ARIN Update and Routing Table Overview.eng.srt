8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,690
in my fine tradition of giving other

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,500
people's presentations that's what i'll

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,989
be doing today so neither of these are

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually my work and I don't know very</font>

12
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:45,690
much about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 but but I found these</font>

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,489
presentation was the second funny way

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,468
the first presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an update on</font>

15
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,899
what the IR IR s the regional registries

16
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,760
how they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> exciting v6 how many blocks</font>

17
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been assigned and the second</font>

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,989
presentation is by a guy whose name I

19
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,989
can't pronounce but I hit something like

20
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,629
him and I don't really know him but I

21
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,099
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> him give this talk at a meeting in</font>

22
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,080
Europe and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a travel</font>

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,580
budget and I thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:15,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting so I traveled the world</font>

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:17,100
giving its presentation so so and anyway

26
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,470
it's really interesting stuff there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

27
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:26,070
global v6 routing table believe it or

28
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:28,020
not so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start so um anyway that's</font>

29
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'll forget that I</font>

30
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,390
don't know if you can read these but I

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,610
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> these with the help of some other</font>

32
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,229
people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are actually really</font>

33
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,909
interesting websites that have different

34
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:44,490
characterizations as a global v6 routing

35
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,430
table and one of them in particular is

36
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,990
like this holistic view and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's visual</font>

37
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can look at you know who</font>

38
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">announced what and which prefix looks</font>

39
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,180
really kind of neat so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

40
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,880
chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're at all interested the</font>

41
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,439
really neat websites and maybe we should

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,408
do some of this stuff would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be for it</font>

43
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,839
might be kind of cool so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

44
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ray pulls back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,060
together about ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> address allocation</font>

46
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,740
process and policy and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that good</font>

47
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,590
stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of history</font>

48
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,080
let's see in 1999 we had an interim

49
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,700
policy and what people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really know</font>

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,890
is that pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much anybody could get a</font>

51
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:26,690
block too bad you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and we</font>

52
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,269
went through a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of processes to try</font>

53
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,090
to have a global kind of a uniform

54
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,400
policy across the regional registries

55
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,890
and we got a joint consensus and may

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,640
2002 on a new initial policy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

57
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:44,059
talk about that some more it's really

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,100
really hard to get consensus among three

59
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,950
different geographic regions now for

60
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,390
because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> lack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick and and you know</font>

61
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different meetings scheduled at</font>

62
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,609
different times it's pretty interesting

63
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,410
so some of you may be familiar with this

64
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:59,240
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might not this is what the</font>

65
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,250
drug<font color="#CCCCCC"> saf used to look like and what the</font>

66
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,920
things used to be called and the bit

67
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:07,370
boundaries<font color="#CCCCCC"> TLAs and sub chiles and as</font>

68
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ray has graciously animated that one</font>

69
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,350
array so we won't talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that I</font>

70
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,360
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if Tony's tutorial talked</font>

71
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:17,810
about this yesterday but it'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick</font>

72
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,240
if it's redundant so the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> breakdown</font>

73
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:26,510
as the address space kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of is it going</font>

74
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:28,160
to do anything hold on ok so the I can't

75
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:31,840
tell whether it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep going or</font>

76
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:35,570
whether it's to stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so an insight</font>

77
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,370
assignment based on RFC 3177 is flash 48

78
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,380
which if you do the math is a really

79
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:43,340
huge amount of address space but

80
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:45,590
everybody wants more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the minimum</font>

81
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:50,210
allocation that the registries give out

82
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:53,300
so in b4 its flash 20 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 it was a /</font>

83
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:57,050
35 but that just got relaxed so folks

84
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:00,220
who have a / 35 already they can get a /

85
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:03,530
32 by just asking you know get it the

86
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">boundary flipped it flipped over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and if</font>

87
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,100
you go and you meet the criteria which

88
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,339
I'll talk about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more then you can</font>

89
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:13,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">get a / 32 which is way bigger than a /</font>

90
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:16,040
30<font color="#CCCCCC"> Q and v4 and then there's a proposal</font>

91
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">underway right now the regional</font>

92
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,729
registries go to I Anna or I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

93
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:26,360
they get they get a slush 23 right they

94
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:29,449
get / 23 that they then allocate out

95
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,550
like they do in v4 and what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

96
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,189
do is get a / 3<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a pool that</font>

97
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,719
that's used among the regional

98
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:38,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">registries so that they can do more</font>

99
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:41,349
smart allocation and spacing out

100
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:44,120
different you know different

101
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:47,030
registrations so that they can grow and

102
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,669
be contiguous so that's a proposal

103
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,080
that's being tossed around and if you

104
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:54,080
have questions about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can ask</font>

105
00:04:51,080 --> 00:05:00,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Richard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jimerson</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Richard J at Aaron's</font>

106
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:02,568
head so how did the assignments work the

107
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:07,610
usual<font color="#CCCCCC"> insights eyes like I said this</font>

108
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:10,159
last 48 / 64 is what you would assign as

109
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,289
an ISP to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a customer if they have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

110
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:14,479
one subnet and they swear they're never

111
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:17,120
going to subnet again and if you have a

112
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,729
device connecting like a you know table

113
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,439
of dial-up subscriber or whatever they

114
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:27,740
get one address which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 128 and then</font>

115
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:30,229
the other assignments that happen or at

116
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,370
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> isp infrastructure you give out a /</font>

117
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:38,900
48<font color="#CCCCCC"> per pop and this is part of our FB</font>

118
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:40,759
3177 as well so how did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen how do</font>

119
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,008
you get initial allocation so most of

120
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">you I guess well at least in theory or</font>

121
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:47,419
ISPs so if you wanted to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 addressed</font>

122
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,888
if you would go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a registry and you</font>

123
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:50,930
would get it just like you do it before

124
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:53,900
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process that that</font>

125
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,960
happens that's a flowchart I love flow

126
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,099
chart so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need an address you're</font>

127
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,620
going to get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them if you need</font>

128
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:03,020
one so if you meet the allocation

129
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,539
criteria which is Israel on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the screen</font>

130
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,849
you're not an insight you must be an ISP

131
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:09,800
in the right region and the other

132
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:11,810
regions they call them LIRS which are

133
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,710
local internet registries which is

134
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:18,050
basically their concept of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP but</font>

135
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,270
it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway that's what it</font>

136
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">means to same thing and if you plan to</font>

137
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:25,909
provide ipv6 connectivity and you're

138
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:29,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have two hundred and sites</font>

139
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:32,330
connected to you in within<font color="#CCCCCC"> two years and</font>

140
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">then if you meet those criteria then you</font>

141
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,630
can get applies where drive space and

142
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:38,539
sign the agreement and pay the fee and

143
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you receive your / 32 which is the</font>

144
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:43,260
minimum out

145
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,060
occasion sorry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> voice so if you</font>

146
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,340
use up that huge amount of address space

147
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,770
that you get which I can't imagine you

148
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,840
would but if you did then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could go</font>

149
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,030
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get more and basically you'd</font>

150
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,669
apply again and you justify another

151
00:06:54,030 --> 00:07:01,190
block and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd get another fresh 32 or</font>

152
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:01,190
they'd move it one bit so you get a 31

153
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:06,270
so let's look<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit at what's</font>

154
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:10,620
been allocated in these<font color="#E5E5E5"> four space the</font>

155
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:15,060
number 17 99 111 those r / 8 right

156
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:18,300
Richard okay this is what's been done in

157
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:22,410
v4 just for comparison the the most

158
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,930
notable thing is that the assignments

159
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,229
for registry<font color="#E5E5E5"> in v4 aaron has assigned</font>

160
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:31,070
quite a bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AP Nick and right</font>

161
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:34,080
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at if you look at the v6</font>

162
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:36,090
allocations you'll see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP Nick and</font>

163
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,300
right are certainly assigning a lot more

164
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:43,710
v6 and actually if if any of you have

165
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:46,110
any ideas why<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so or I'd like to</font>

166
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear from people about you know why</font>

167
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,849
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing v6 or because it seems</font>

168
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:53,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a really really the thing to do</font>

169
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:57,229
another you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's outside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the US</font>

170
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,510
so anyway this is the breakdown of the

171
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:04,229
numbers after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know 29 62 63</font>

172
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:06,900
those are actually allocations<font color="#E5E5E5"> tattoo of</font>

173
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:09,120
ISPs for those of you the / 30 tues that

174
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,429
had been handed<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and then this is a</font>

175
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,820
graph over time and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

176
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">breakdown for country of and the the</font>

177
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,110
numbers by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country's again are the /</font>

178
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,720
32 source watch 35s depending on whether

179
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">they come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to get their 32 so this</font>

180
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,970
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it looks like so there's a lot</font>

181
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:28,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Japan and certainly you know all the</font>

182
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,370
other little all the other little slices

183
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:37,279
combined certainly it's pretty large and

184
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:39,839
that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the v6 registry report</font>

185
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,809
did should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I take questions in the</font>

186
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,180
middle or does anybody have any comments

187
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:50,660
or questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

188
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:55,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I didn't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so because I don't</font>

189
00:08:50,660 --> 00:09:00,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it doesn't seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like that's free so</font>

190
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:02,870
this is um not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> English just to see if</font>

191
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,420
you're like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time presented this</font>

192
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,399
was in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right meeting and greece i</font>

193
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:12,140
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> so i think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe this might</font>

194
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:14,660
be drink but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i couldn't figure out he</font>

195
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,010
has him in this HTML thing with an index

196
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,839
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't figure out how to delete</font>

197
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,930
this slide without stirring up the index

198
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,540
so I left it this is what it really says

199
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:25,279
and I have his email address later on if

200
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,810
you're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in asking him</font>

201
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,899
questions because I may not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

202
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:32,899
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question but again I heard</font>

203
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:35,779
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> and presents this talk and a right</font>

204
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:37,040
meeting quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while ago and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was kind</font>

205
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:38,959
of kind of thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was neat that</font>

206
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,459
there was a global v6 routing table and

207
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the stuff that actually happens</font>

208
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:43,910
in the v6 routing table is pretty

209
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:46,640
entertaining so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

210
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:50,029
audience would really appreciate it so

211
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">um what is it well you know it's a bunch</font>

212
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:55,220
of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISPs exchanging routes and</font>

213
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:57,170
and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some pictures</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

214
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:03,020
observations and some of them were

215
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:04,729
pretty cool so the v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing table</font>

216
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,640
contains a mixture of fixed phone

217
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,740
address space which is historical and oh

218
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,199
and another comment about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6-foot</font>

219
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,930
address space it's actually since the

220
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,400
last nanog i was at there was a lot of

221
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,870
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a lot of discussions and it</font>

222
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,189
looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the regional registries are</font>

223
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,500
actually going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

224
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,150
allocation and and maintenance as a

225
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,120
fixed phone address space which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

226
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:28,640
really kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a neat thing so it's a</font>

227
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,350
mixture of the newly allocated rir box

228
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,410
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixth unboxing I have a whole</font>

229
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,390
buncha graph of how that's broken down

230
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:37,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">some AS IS announced the six bone stuff</font>

231
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:40,100
only and there's a next year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and some of</font>

232
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,750
them advertise our IR space only<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

233
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,279
it depends on what you got you know

234
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,480
because if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have one block you really</font>

235
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,140
don't need another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless you're</font>

236
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,620
transitioning the infrastructure is a

237
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,449
little different from region to region

238
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:56,870
the really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting things for this</font>

239
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">group are that unlike and v4 pretty much</font>

240
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,480
everybody's giving

241
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:02,540
transit to everybody else and it could

242
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,239
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that changes over time but I</font>

243
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,889
think in the spirit of getting a new

244
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:09,980
protocol working and getting everybody

245
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:11,660
happy and cooperating and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

246
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,399
actually just it's like in the old days

247
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,639
where if you peered you got everybody's

248
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:18,369
routes from everybody there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

249
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:22,220
of filtering going on as you'll see

250
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:23,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is pretty entertaining and there's</font>

251
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,869
still a lot of tunnels<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the tunnels</font>

252
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:30,529
of you know being<font color="#E5E5E5"> phased out so I'll</font>

253
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:33,679
talk some more about that so um the way

254
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:37,040
this chart should be read is on the

255
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,779
rafters if the length prefix and then if

256
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,118
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> color morally over on</font>

257
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:44,509
the right that's that's what the same

258
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:47,929
numbers were on April twenty-eighth the

259
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:51,199
last time you ran the numbers so on what

260
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:55,029
is that September 9370 for prefixes in

261
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:58,128
the global v6 routing table and on April

262
00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:00,139
twenty-eighth there were 297 and this is

263
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:02,660
the breakdown so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see there</font>

264
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:05,839
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of 35 s and 30 tues because</font>

265
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:08,809
those are the minimum allocation there's

266
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:12,619
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of flash 48 which does a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

267
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:15,499
you know people advertising more

268
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:18,619
specifics and there's a couple / 128

269
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:21,259
which kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cool oops I don't know</font>

270
00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:23,209
whether people will start filtering in

271
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:27,499
the long run but this is mostly because

272
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:30,189
nobody's filtering so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what the</font>

273
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:32,809
growth looks like for the last 12<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

274
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:40,519
and this is all the prefixes whether

275
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:43,610
there are ir or six bones and some of

276
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,740
these little Peaks are big Peaks there's

277
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,540
some breakdowns of what they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'll</font>

278
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,139
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about those and this is a</font>

279
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:54,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">comparison of the the top line well in</font>

280
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:56,029
the beginning the top line is the sixth

281
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:58,128
on space in the bottom line<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our IR</font>

282
00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:01,069
space and what's interesting is they're

283
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:03,110
starting to cross the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR prefixes are</font>

284
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:06,169
starting to grow beyond the you know

285
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,819
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the six bone prefixes so it</font>

286
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:10,120
seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that natural</font>

287
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:12,849
processes the rirs<font color="#E5E5E5"> designing the space</font>

288
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:16,380
the six bowknot is starting to happen

289
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:21,190
there toward the end see so there's

290
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:24,189
about 200 and some prefixes depending on

291
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:27,279
who d aggregated what day and then

292
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:30,580
reaggravated again excuse me so these

293
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,350
are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of their little blips so on</font>

294
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:36,730
the rest you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that somebody d</font>

295
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:38,920
aggregated 65 48 out of six bone space I

296
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ASM</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> verse there so you can work it</font>

297
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">up if you want and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another one</font>

298
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:47,890
more somebody preach 37 more specifics

299
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,690
so that happens a lot sometimes as you

300
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:52,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">can see they usually get d aggregated</font>

301
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:56,680
again it's just somebody who didn't

302
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:01,300
filter right this is interesting because

303
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:07,630
you know the policy change from 35 to 30

304
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:10,479
tues happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7701 so what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that july</font>

305
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,820
july first and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

306
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,000
30 tooth are growing and the 35s are

307
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,680
starting to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get aggregated and</font>

308
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,360
disappear from the running table which

309
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,620
makes them really interesting artifacts

310
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:27,550
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll show you in a couple minutes</font>

311
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:31,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oh see um the 624 prefixes and I don't</font>

312
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,680
know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this but it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

313
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:34,480
there's some being advertised I think

314
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,160
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of this slide is that</font>

315
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,890
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones that are that are</font>

316
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,839
advertising them the ass embers and

317
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,089
there's some more<font color="#CCCCCC"> information on the</font>

318
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:45,940
anycast addresses and art and RF user

320
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:54,190
a look at that let's see so in the

321
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,709
summer aid there's 144 allocations out

322
00:14:54,190 --> 00:15:00,279
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2001 block that are being</font>

323
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:02,020
announced and 201 allocations by the

324
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,120
rirs and here's the breakdown<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,100
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> and parenthesis is the number</font>

327
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:12,130
was 431 2002 so Aaron's grown a little

328
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,839
bit and if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ap</font>

329
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:18,880
Nick and rice<font color="#E5E5E5"> have grown quite a bit</font>

330
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:22,800
since April the 144 allocations visible

331
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:25,019
but L 960 are 161

332
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,689
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the breakdown of the</font>

333
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,670
prefix length and some of them are still

kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes sense for transitioning</font>

337
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:42,240
there's 241 unique a esas which is grown

Garrett said<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're seeing some time</font>

347
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:09,690
between May and sep tember but then not

348
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,518
anymore after September tents so those

349
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:15,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">are three fixes that you know I've been</font>

350
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:18,690
withdrawn because it's less specific /

30 choose the I<font color="#E5E5E5"> X's or exchange point</font>

352

show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some there's some ghost</font>

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,660
vendors in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have any idea</font>

358
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:41,010
or people have any idea why contacting

359
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,540
her it would be pretty useful because

360
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:47,130
he's been trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check this down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

361
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:48,449
a while so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing</font>

362
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:51,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">that happens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you start advertising</font>

363
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:53,700
the 32 and you withdrawal the 35 you end

364
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:56,360
up with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> ghosts announcements with</font>

365
00:16:53,700 --> 00:17:00,630
these really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice AF has really short</font>

366
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,550
you know concise AF has seemed to stay

367
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">around for a really long period of time</font>

368
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,178
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really resemble</font>

369
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,689
the AAS pass of the originally announced

370
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:13,040
/ 35 as you can see and this happens a

371
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:15,449
lot and they'll be there for months so

372
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're not there's there's some series</font>

373
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:22,620
but nobody's really figured out why this

374
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:25,979
happens there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of prefixes in the</font>

375
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:28,319
table<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually aren't prefixes at</font>

376
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:31,640
all or out of blocks that shouldn't be

377
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:36,178
advertised<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here's a few of those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

378
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,220
think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

379
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:40,470
is another one with the really long AAS

380
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,059
pass that was advertised correctly and

381
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:46,129
then pulled out of the routing table and

382
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:48,690
it stayed around for what did you say

383
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:53,389
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> months with this really long AAS</font>

384
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:56,490
pass so that's kind of cool let's see

385
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:58,439
there's a lot of lazy aggregation going

386
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,090
on where people just say oh well

387
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,879
nobody's filtering and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just</font>

388
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:06,418
announced whatever and so there's these

389
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:10,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">/ 128 in the global routing table which</font>

390
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:11,999
are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool I'm sure that that'll be</font>

391
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,178
great when we have lots of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

392
00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:17,190
v6 it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

393
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:19,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">multihoming going on looking where</font>

394
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:22,769
people are announcing more specifics to

395
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:25,230
multi home and there's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> no really</font>

396
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:26,940
defined practice if anybody in here is

397
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,009
on the multi<font color="#E5E5E5"> six mailing list you'll see</font>

398
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,259
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're lots of interesting ideas</font>

399
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:34,740
for how we would multi home and nobody's

400
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:36,749
agreeing on any of them so that's a real

401
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:40,369
concern I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be six because we</font>

402
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:44,220
could have really large routing table

403
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:47,879
please invalid AF numbers are pretty

404
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,889
cool so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no there's several</font>

405
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:51,629
people announcing ones that shouldn't be

406
00:18:49,889 --> 00:18:54,959
announced and once that aren't assigned

407
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:57,408
like 45 328 isn't a sign but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in the</font>

408
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">routing table which is kind of neat</font>

409
00:18:57,409 --> 00:19:03,570
let's see I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what else I like</font>

410
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:05,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">this one I like the its online slide if</font>

411
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,860
somebody had a bug i guess it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bug</font>

412
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:11,039
in zebra so they announced a lot of the

413
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,469
v6 space is that wasn't there and

414
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:20,820
decided to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was all there so that's</font>

415
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:23,039
kind of cool the good news and more

416
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,658
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> appearing natively with v6 and</font>

417
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:29,519
the tunnels are<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to go away</font>

418
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:31,649
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice let's see they're</font>

419
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,200
doing smarter things over the tunnels

420
00:19:31,649 --> 00:19:36,178
with cgp metrics people have started

421
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">filtering for obvious reasons on the</font>

422
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:42,330
previous slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of probably a</font>

423
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:44,100
good thing you usually what happens is

424
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:46,080
people accept everything so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

425
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,178
can get everywhere but they're they're

426
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,120
conscientious about what they re

427
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:52,000
advertised to

428
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,120
appears which is kind of polite and

429
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,530
here's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice precinct filter if</font>

430
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,120
you're interested in filtering and

431
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:03,250
there's some more<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter stuff on here</font>

432
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,820
web page<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you're interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

433
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:13,350
take a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that put my voice holds</font>

434
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:13,350
out so these are oh that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

435
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,820
these are my slides so I have no

436
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,629
empirical proof of my own then it works

437
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:25,419
but I've heard it does I have a funny

438
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:28,179
story that I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this workshop where</font>

439
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:30,429
we hooked<font color="#E5E5E5"> up v6 and network with the</font>

440
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:33,130
guys in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room they were like I don't</font>

441
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:36,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to a dozen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of us or so and I have</font>

442
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:38,440
this I'd look and it's running OS 10 and

443
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,178
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> loaded Bieber on it because I heard</font>

444
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,350
the rigid v6 and I went off to this

445
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:43,480
meeting and I spent half the morning

446
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:46,030
looking on the web page trying to find

447
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,130
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to configure v6 on my laptop</font>

448
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,600
which was feudal because nobody at Apple

449
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,300
hasn't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean like the customer</font>

450
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,909
support people that the man pages have

451
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,590
no idea and so I thought well you know

452
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,660
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the router working and it was</font>

453
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:00,850
happily doling out addresses and so I

454
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,620
didn't ask him<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sagan sure enough I'd</font>

455
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:05,399
learned my address and it all just

456
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:08,699
worked it was like it was pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> scary</font>

457
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:11,200
yes I wasted like four hours reading

458
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,840
documentation when it just worked so

459
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,730
that was kind of cool although I did

460
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,290
learn that subnetting these addresses is

461
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:23,440
just really evil but you can spell

462
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:25,389
things and uh you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dad so every</font>

463
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,730
group at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rim got more creative about</font>

464
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,290
work words they could spell so I'm

465
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,120
waiting to see somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a thing a</font>

466
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,920
little subnetting tool that lets you

467
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,870
pick what words you want in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> choices</font>

468
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,490
so when you give them to somebody you

469
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:41,500
don't like you can write something in

470
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:44,500
the address that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool so the</font>

471
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:49,440
stability apparently from from their

472
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:52,300
point of view has gotten better their

473
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,400
software problems are getting better

474
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:57,970
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that guy who advertised everything</font>

475
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,070
was actually a bug and the transit

476
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,720
sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know with everything</font>

477
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,990
that when people start making money they

478
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,080
still

479
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,400
giving transit so if you want v6 transit

480
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,909
maybe you should start peering now

481
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,490
because you might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it soon and</font>

482
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:15,040
filtering is recommended and you know

483
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:18,750
certainly makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense to watch out what</font>

484
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:21,220
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what people are advertising and</font>

485
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,350
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to consider getting rid</font>

486
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,550
of the guys doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bad stuff although</font>

487
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:27,129
it doesn't seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> like there are a lot of</font>

488
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:35,649
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was curious how many people here</font>

489
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:37,380
are doing v6 not as many huh why would

490
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:40,660
they do it or why shouldn't they do it

491
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,220
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you doing it because anybody do</font>

492
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,450
you have customers does anybody have a

493
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:52,570
paying customer that uses v6 Wow<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

494
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:55,570
that's cool well i think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh oh and</font>

495
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:58,240
here's some purpose and little other

496
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:00,520
things to look at and again the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> urls</font>

497
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,530
i had at the beginning are really pretty

498
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,000
interesting if you're into like looking

499
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:07,240
at the routing table they're pretty neat

500
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,090
I think that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of my incredibly</font>

501
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,030
short presentation does anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

502
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:14,980
give any feedback about why they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

503
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:18,550
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the other I mean I know</font>

504
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:21,850
that my take on it is that in in in

505
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:23,800
other countries you know they they

506
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,260
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much before so you know</font>

507
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of v6 and you know</font>

508
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,830
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know cellular phone</font>

509
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,809
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and stuff that are really keen</font>

510
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,370
on having enough address space to do

511
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:35,710
what they want to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

512
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:39,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all obvious coming to the</font>

513
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:41,620
microphone how exciting oh let's see

514
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,960
what Abby has to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you just</font>

515
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:45,729
walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the peanut gallery has</font>

516
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,770
suggested that most of the countries

517
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:50,309
when it's made the observation that most

518
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:53,320
of the countries where ipv6 has been

519
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:55,360
employee use the engineers get five

520
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,720
weeks a year of vacation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they</font>

521
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,350
have 4x<font color="#E5E5E5"> ministers</font>

522
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,630
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> with no technology you know</font>

523
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:04,428
they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on their vacation I don't</font>

524
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,870
know maybe who knows wishing that they

525
00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:07,490
have good work ethic he may just get

526
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,590
five weeks of<font color="#E5E5E5"> vacation because they live</font>

527
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,940
in those countries so but you know

528
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,350
seriously I was talking with one of the

529
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,940
evil government people who will on

530
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,730
monday and what should the building

531
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,320
strategy for ipv6 be<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said it seems</font>

532
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">really simple it's like the new net</font>

533
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,450
thing right until<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are content</font>

534
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,940
providers who are only accessible on it

535
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,530
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> in users for only accessible woman</font>

536
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">where we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run out of like in</font>

537
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:31,970
space which we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to do in the</font>

538
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:33,740
next receiver you know a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years it</font>

539
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,659
just isn't that much of a priority for

540
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,400
people who are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> earth alert that's</font>

541
00:24:35,659 --> 00:24:40,659
what I see from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

542
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:43,250
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> was so this is the lazy American</font>

543
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:44,390
isn't very relevant yet because no one

544
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:48,110
wants to pay for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's no</font>

545
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:51,350
crisis that make sense I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> followed</font>

546
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:53,000
that um for those who read the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

547
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,399
tutorial you learn I heard this but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

548
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">apologize for being redundant I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

549
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:01,309
in Shanghai in August and an education

550
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:03,559
conference in the education network

551
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:06,158
manager told me he could have used 72 /

552
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:09,889
eights if he could get though right and

553
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:11,360
how could<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do to go doubt his network</font>

554
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:14,740
and then over dinner we were talking

555
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,000
he's got 320 million students to support

556
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,309
right if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the population of</font>

557
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">North America it's under 300 million so</font>

558
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,940
I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the back of the napkin'</font>

559
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:26,179
calculation and Aaron lineage is about

560
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:28,610
75 / aids that don't count<font color="#E5E5E5"> Department of</font>

Defense or anything like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's in</font>

562
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:34,280
the ballpark for what we use currently

563
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:36,710
right for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> population he wants to</font>

564
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,270
support so effectively we're gone it's

565
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:43,940
all gone already because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only 90</font>

566
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:49,580
left right anybody else

567
00:25:43,940 --> 00:26:01,039
oh yes sir well my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stephen and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

568
00:25:49,580 --> 00:26:02,870
use ipv6 hi Steven and I will confess to

569
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,940
having gotten involved with it when I

570
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:08,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a researcher and it was a fun</font>

571
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:10,100
science fair experiment since then I

572
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:14,480
have fallen in with an even worse crowd

573
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:17,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh yeah and there are you know one of</font>

574
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,429
the hats that I wear<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm expected to</font>

575
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:23,629
provide infrastructure that will operate

576
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:26,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">in ipv6 land and so not wanting to</font>

577
00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:29,990
function in the vacuum that I learned

578
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,309
was so comfortable in research we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,320
presence<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're out there on the</font>

584
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:51,559
eventually we support them in my other

in my day job my<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers expect that</font>

00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:55,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm in the same way that i provide</font>

going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide v6 exchange point</font>

589
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:03,740
services and you know at least there

590
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:06,860
there's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really any rocket science</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

591
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:09,559
move ethernet frames for a living and so

592
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,500
if the ether type is 800 vs<font color="#E5E5E5"> living in</font>

593
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:14,389
forever the user type is for ipv6 frames

00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">6 one-half dozen the other to me I just</font>

595
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:18,529
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to dole out exchange point</font>

596
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:19,490
addresses like I do for before but then

597
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:20,960
have some clue to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer</font>

598
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,779
questions when people have trouble

599
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,950
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> v6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working or they wonder why</font>

600
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:31,100
they see certain types of announcements

601
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:33,909
on the exchange point prefix they ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

602
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:38,168
and I say no no that's wrong and I go

603
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:40,909
you know educate whoever is sending

604
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:47,409
router no router announcements<font color="#E5E5E5"> or what</font>

605
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:47,409
have you so that's my that's my thing

606
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:52,770
all right I feel feel better I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

607
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:58,980
so better than Thank You<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stephen</font>

608
00:27:52,770 --> 00:28:02,940
everybody support what a nice experience

609
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:07,470
I have a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I well I work for a</font>

610
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,730
carrier now but before<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's like</font>

611
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:13,560
one of those things too is and I where I

612
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:15,900
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Terry I have some experience</font>

613
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,620
trying to get a technology pushed out

614
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:21,210
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet I'm in the past and</font>

615
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:23,840
you know I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of come to the point</font>

616
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,890
like there's ask my question Antonia's

617
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,419
you know it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it seems like</font>

618
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">when there's a desire and a need for</font>

619
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:33,330
something dinner that community really

620
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:37,740
mobilizes well you know and alec so what

621
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:39,149
so if there is this huge you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I the</font>

622
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,830
carrier thing is kind of instructed to

623
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:44,280
me because the carrier i work for

624
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:47,460
happens to have a cellular and so we get

625
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:50,600
along really well yeah well i think so i

626
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:55,830
don't use it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does I</font>

627
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:57,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I've tried anyway but so I don't I</font>

628
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,699
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully understand what the problem</font>

629
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:02,310
is with ipv6 if there's a huge demand

630
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:03,780
for our address space because apparently

631
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,669
based on what son was saying maybe

632
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:08,129
that's what's driving things if that's

633
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:09,570
there why why aren't their business

634
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:11,640
models why aren't these things happening

635
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:13,679
and is there anything we can learn from

636
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,720
our past experience that will be

637
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:20,360
instructed as to why why this is

638
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:23,730
happening this way maybe six pregnant um

639
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:28,620
to follow on some of the things we'll

640
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:31,080
talk about next time more detail but one

641
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,520
of the issues is you as a community are

642
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,379
not going to go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and deploy a bunch</font>

643
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,760
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff unless you see customers</font>

644
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:41,250
demanding it right and and IP by its

645
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:44,010
nature is not something your customers

646
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:45,390
are aware of per se and what packets to

647
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,650
move right they've got an application

648
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,240
you happen to know it means IP

649
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:52,590
underneath it but they probably don't

650
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,750
and in particular for consumers we if

651
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,459
we've made it so that the consumer knows

652
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:58,570
that you're using be six instead of v4

653
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,500
something's really screwed up

654
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:02,059
consumers shouldn't ever see the

655
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,920
difference all I know is they type on a

656
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:08,030
type of name or click on a link and

657
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:10,010
magic happens right so what you're going

658
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,840
to get is an implicit demand if you

659
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:13,610
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at your network and you</font>

660
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,709
start seeing a lot of protocol type 41

661
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,780
packets flying around that's implicit

662
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:20,480
demand from your customers that they

663
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:23,389
want v6 right because what we've done is

664
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,390
made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so that this technology is</font>

665
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:27,950
deplorable independent of the routing

666
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:31,040
fabric where some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

667
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:33,080
technologies required you to move them

668
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,090
in conjunction so this will be covered

669
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible and you can get</font>

670
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,389
this implicit demand so when you're

671
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to start seeing that enforce it</font>

672
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:43,670
demand that's you know the leading

673
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:45,800
question and it's a hard prediction but

674
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:49,250
you know certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft has already</font>

675
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:51,590
started telling their development

676
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:54,230
partners that this is important as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font>

677
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:56,870
as they're concerned it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> embedded in XD</font>

678
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:59,360
it's coming and done<font color="#E5E5E5"> netserver</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with our</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Sony is pushing hard into this space</font>

681
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,870
you're seeing a lot of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Japanese</font>

682
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:08,410
service providers turning it on and new

683
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:10,909
applications coming from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> area so</font>

684
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually hit I</font>

685
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,780
can't tell you but sometime over the

686
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,300
next couple of years there will be a lot

687
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:21,559
of implicit and shits going on because

688
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:24,530
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

689
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:27,080
in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh a lot of our customers are</font>

690
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:28,520
ISPs and that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an artifact</font>

691
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,710
that's visible to them that's the other

692
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,200
space issue so it's not that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't</font>

693
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:35,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">know you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them are asking</font>

694
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,360
for I've heard a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for</font>

695
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:42,290
v6 based on that as the artifact that

696
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,850
that's a value to them so I know it's

697
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:45,230
not the customers don't see it end user

698
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,178
since it may be and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's what</font>

699
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:48,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">you meant right what customers do see it</font>

700
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:50,990
especially in the case of carriers were

701
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:52,250
a lot of their customers are ISPs a lot

702
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:53,420
of their problem that has to do with you

703
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,820
know I can't get outer space I can't

704
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:57,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember all of this other stuff one of</font>

705
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,990
the one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proposals I heard from</font>

706
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,840
somebody who I want I'll let him remain

707
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:05,540
anonymous was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that may be what they</font>

708
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,310
would do as an ISP would be to tell the

709
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:10,310
customers well if you want you want

710
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:11,059
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> v4 stressful you know address</font>

711
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">for your</font>

712
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:14,840
house then you pay five bucks or

713
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:17,029
whatever but if you want if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

714
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,949
switch to v6 you can have it thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

715
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:22,340
so I could never have to talk to me

716
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:23,809
again for free why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do that what</font>

717
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,480
we're making what would be my business

718
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:28,279
advantage and doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because I would</font>

719
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,440
actually have to provide that facility

720
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:32,330
now now what why would I do that well I

721
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,539
can tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> who proposed it later and</font>

722
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:36,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you can talk to him all right okay</font>

723
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:38,870
official reasons I'm just I'm just

724
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,519
wondering it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really it</font>

725
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:42,379
doesn't it would go the other way I

726
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:46,659
would imagine well I think that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

727
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:46,658
his<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to move v6 forward</font>

728
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:57,529
seated / 64 is for the masses give a

729
00:32:52,899 --> 00:33:01,008
powerful incentive to the virus authors

730
00:32:57,529 --> 00:33:07,159
to not even bother spoofing for unicast

731
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:09,379
r PF changs second straight man last

732
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:11,950
night in the security boss the

733
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:14,209
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> about unicast RPF came up and</font>

734
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:17,710
since we have a much larger group today

735
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:23,690
I don't react the question you know

736
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:25,940
given that the way unicast RPF needs to

737
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:28,309
work to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very effective and pushed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

738
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,990
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way out to the edge it needs to</font>

739
00:33:28,309 --> 00:33:33,499
be the default setting for everything

740
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:35,179
right but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go and tell the product</font>

741
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:37,460
teams would they need to do this as a

742
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:39,169
default in all cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> they come back and</font>

743
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:41,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">say but the customers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are telling me</font>

744
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:43,249
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't want strict unicast i'll</font>

745
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:46,279
be off because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work if I'm</font>

746
00:33:43,249 --> 00:33:48,230
the multi homes thing right and so this

747
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:50,289
community having the clue you know I

748
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:52,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and has the ability to turn it off</font>

749
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:54,289
with the people you really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

750
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:55,580
have it turned on don't have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CUDA</font>

751
00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:59,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">card on so we need to turn it on by</font>

752
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:00,740
default right and so I you know I asked

753
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,029
the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> last night how many people</font>

754
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,259
would learn it on by default everybody

755
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:04,789
raised their hand and then they

756
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:08,780
immediately said but I don't want it to

757
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:11,480
apply to me right so if there is a cost

758
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:14,629
trade-off here so might my point to the

759
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,310
community is if you believe unicast RPF

760
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:19,480
at the very edge where it does the most

761
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:22,520
good is effective you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to tell your</font>

762
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,900
vendors this and be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear and be</font>

763
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,989
willing to step<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and turn it</font>

764
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,310
off if it doesn't apply to you right if

765
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:31,459
that's the thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual it'll be</font>

766
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:34,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">cheaper in the long run you know solve</font>

767
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:38,570
this but you do have a point spoofing

768
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:39,920
within the 64-bit space yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

769
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,920
they can do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of damage their quotes</font>

770
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:46,070
right but you know you allocated that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 64</font>

771
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit submit to that customer therefore</font>

772
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,730
you can track it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer and</font>

773
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:53,420
they can be whichever host in that space

774
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:55,460
but you'd still that customer and I hope

775
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's 64 is within their infrastructure</font>

776
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:01,510
and if they don't then have to fan it

777
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:04,700
out to a whole bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of / 1 thoughts</font>

778
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:07,070
well if if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do finance</font>

779
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,870
we give them 48 right in that way

780
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:13,060
they're giving 64 and you could track it

781
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:17,779
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the subnet so I've a story similar to</font>

782
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:20,540
the knack story um except I had a pile

783
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:22,790
of iron from some unnamed router vendor

784
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:26,029
and had put it all glued it all together

785
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:28,790
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is as my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I signed a</font>

786
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:31,220
couple of ipv6 addresses and lo and

787
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,810
behold it just worked well you know all

788
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:35,680
the sudden my v6 routing table was

789
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:39,680
populated me and I didn't do anything

790
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:44,379
it's magic not really but it sounded

791
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:47,859
good anyway anybody else<font color="#CCCCCC"> or are we done</font>

792
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,860
great thanks
