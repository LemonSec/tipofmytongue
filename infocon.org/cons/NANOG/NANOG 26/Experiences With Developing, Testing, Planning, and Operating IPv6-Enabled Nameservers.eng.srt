and so well answer to the question that

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,500
came up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kathy I want to recount</font>

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,018
something I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said some time ago which is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that if you attach enough rocket</font>

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:19,500

other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take a very</font>

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:06,060
document an API but there's an RFC by

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,369
Matt Thomas and some other people that I

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">think cleans up a lot of the socket</font>

22
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,530
model and gives you a much better handle

23
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,270
on sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do if you're</font>

24
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,180
a multi-homed host and you want to make

25
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,820
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your UDP responses go out with</font>

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,380
a source address that corresponds to the

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,899
destination of the packet you're

28
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:29,009
answering that used to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult</font>

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:32,930
now it's very easy there were some

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:36,060
config changes to be named ed comp for

31
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:38,689
ipv6 handling and largely<font color="#E5E5E5"> this just</font>

32
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,780
means that in places<font color="#CCCCCC"> put aside arrest</font>

33
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:46,589
used to be just ipv4 it's now also v6

34
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,680
but it must be<font color="#E5E5E5"> noted that again because</font>

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:53,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way you listen it's a little bit</font>

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,790
harder on a v6 machine to decide which

37
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,679
interface you will listen on so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

a slightly different syntactic model

about how you would you do with listen

40
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,490
on and it was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> our idea that was just</font>

41
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,860
sort of what we had to do to

what the v6 community do what they

wanted some of you may have heard of an

multi-segment at a six record that would

48

have let you build an address by more or

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR who had delegated you the space</font>

when you have 128 bits it's pretty easy

to find a convenient for a bit boundary

<font color="#CCCCCC">will use a dual stack host and so they</font>

get your work done and never know until

ability is one of the application layer

problems that various folks are still

133
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,630
working on and hopefully an encore count

134
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:47,760
to the microphone and give us a snapshot

135
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:51,090
on that I mean by reach ability is if

136
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:54,030
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a zone that is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only has</font>

142
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,570
is probably more common where if you

143
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:12,120
will only have these six addresses on

144
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,980
your computer but you have to reach ad

145
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,930
for an<font color="#E5E5E5"> inservice because until you've</font>

146
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">been referred to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone who only has a</font>

147
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:22,170
records for their glue what<font color="#E5E5E5"> ought you do</font>

148
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:28,830
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we'll have some help for that</font>

149
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:32,360
during the<font color="#CCCCCC"> QA obviously answering</font>

150
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:35,280
authoritative<font color="#CCCCCC"> li-on v6 is pretty easy</font>

151
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,810
but in our testing we also wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

152
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,809
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could answer zone</font>

153
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:43,320
transfers initiate zone transfers fall

154
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:45,860
back appropriately if somebody specified

155
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,659
as the master servers for his own

156
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,850
collection of both v6 and v4 addresses

157
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,990
so all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up in the test plan</font>

158
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:57,480
as well forwarding one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we</font>

159
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,640
do is we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a v6 reachable name server</font>

160
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,260
that does the recursion and forwarding

161
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">so that's the thing you put in</font>

162
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:08,730
resolv.conf is dual stack so if you as a

163
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,340
purist are inside my land you'll be able

164
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,410
to talk v6 to them server that is then

165
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,419
able to chase down both a records and

166
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,360
quad a records so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crutch that</font>

167
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,810
we happen to use there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

168
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,300
approaches that look

169
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:24,300
like Matt that perhaps we'll hear about

170
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,419
so all of these things were ultimately

171
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:34,029
need to work before we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> releasing</font>

172
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:43,510
snapshots that claims to support v6

173
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:48,640
transport so we'll say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's latched</font>

174
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:51,279
32 is a lot of space about half of that

175
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lamb just the way that they do</font>

176
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,730
the mapping of addresses inside of a

177
00:08:55,089 --> 00:09:00,700
dhoti got one network is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they need</font>

178
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">this last 64 to make it work and so 48</font>

179
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,450
of those bits go into the mac address

180
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:07,360
and then 16 other bits go into various

181
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,850
other things so that means you are

182
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,060
limited to only four billion lambs

183
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:18,370
inside of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a / 32 so be careful with</font>

184
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:21,400
that in our case where you see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> w x y</font>

185
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:24,490
and z we have a number of just zeros

186
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,050
that are intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a future expansion</font>

187
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,150
and then we have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> site codes and</font>

188
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:34,270
then within sight codes we have sort of

189
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:38,890
veal and tags so on the / 48<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

190
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:40,540
will use<font color="#E5E5E5"> for effort they gave us a / 48</font>

191
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:42,220
because they knew we would be filtered

192
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,189
if they gave us a longer prefix than

193
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,380
that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only need one address so</font>

194
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:52,330
we're dedicating an awful lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bits to</font>

195
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:54,490
just representing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one thing and yes</font>

196
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:56,140
as Kathy<font color="#CCCCCC"> said you can spell things it's</font>

197
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,480
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun you see a lot of dead and</font>

198
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,720
beef and things like that in these

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,580
addresses in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> case I used 1034 because</font>

200
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:09,100
that's the RFC that gave rise to the

201
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:15,850
protocol so there is funding funding can

202
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:18,100
be had now in operating these and

203
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,140
upgrade an infrastructure of a whole

204
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,899
bunch of blind date servers to run by

205
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:25,970
nine and

206
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:28,579
sorry to say that we didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

207
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:33,350
that in earnest until we started using

208
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:37,549
v6 so my normal policy for ISC is that

209
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:39,529
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> so-called eat our own dog food and we</font>

210
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:41,389
run the same software that we publish

211
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:43,339
but when you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two major releases</font>

212
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:44,989
that are both still in production and

213
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:47,480
both still getting released cuts once in

214
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:49,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">a while then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of decide</font>

215
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,929
which one you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the one</font>

216
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,689
that got run was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one that had been</font>

217
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:56,809
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> run for years previously but</font>

218
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:58,879
when the ops people inside of ifc's

219
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:00,350
started running by nine they discovered

220
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,259
all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

221
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:06,230
terrible just a lack of syslog and the

222
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:07,910
lack of feedback from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rndc command</font>

223
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,759
were two things that had to get fixed

224
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same day the deployment happened so</font>

225
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:14,929
if you've seen any improvement in that

226
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:18,499
then you know where it came from now

227
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:20,660
it's eerie to folks who run high volume

228
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:23,269
in servers to switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> from bind 82 by</font>

229
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,399
nine because you'll do a PS command and

230
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:28,579
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will see no name dash expert</font>

231
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:31,660
commands in your process table that's

232
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:34,519
gone so this now just does everything

233
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,799
internal to the one process and has its

234
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:42,980
own multiplexing and task switching

235
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:45,589
internally<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it almost overcomes the</font>

236
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:48,739
fact that it uses a lot more CPU cycles

237
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:51,559
per query but again you can put multiple

238
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:54,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">CPUs to the task so if you have one of</font>

239
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:57,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">these high-performance multiprocessors</font>

240
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:59,749
eon or<font color="#CCCCCC"> solaris you know spark with local</font>

241
00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:02,899
alpha whatever it is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cut a lot of</font>

242
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:06,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">CPUs by nine we use them all and it</font>

243
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:10,040
needs them all and it will need more

244
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:13,579
memory as well we we didn't generally

245
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,498
notice about a 25-percent bloat just

246
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:17,748
going from<font color="#E5E5E5"> bind 82</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by nine with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

247
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:19,100
set of zones what loaded and then you'll

248
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:21,679
notice an additional twenty five percent

249
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,989
bloke if you go from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 32-bit machine to</font>

250
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:27,589
a 64-bit machine because a lot of the

251
00:12:23,989 --> 00:12:29,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">memory footprint is just pointers but</font>

252
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:32,029
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Moore's law says that</font>

253
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,130
successful software companies should be

254
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:36,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">finding ways to use all of this</font>

255
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:43,890
all of this new<font color="#CCCCCC"> silicone so we're doing</font>

256
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:49,050
our part there are name servers out

257
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:51,569
there that really do some bad things so

258
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:54,750
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if you ask them a question</font>

259
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:57,089
about a quad a record at a given node

260
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,190
even if there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a records at that at</font>

261
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:03,390
that name<font color="#CCCCCC"> they will tell you that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

262
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:05,550
name itself does not exist and there's

263
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:09,390
an interesting fallback behavior written

264
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:11,910
into the ipv6 transports in order to

265
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:13,439
cope<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this possibility because you</font>

266
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,790
know you could be referred to<font color="#CCCCCC"> as own and</font>

267
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,779
you could be trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the right</font>

records but the zone you were delegated

273
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:34,200
to doesn't really says and so we

274
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:36,029
actually retry in some cases using a

275
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,649
even after we've been told that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name</font>

276
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:39,779
doesn't exist because there are these

00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:43,230
other implementations out there that are

278
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:45,899
just terrible you can also have a load

279
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:48,240
balancer that will answer a query for a

280
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,970
record what I just don't answer anything

281
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,610
else doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you anything so again</font>

282
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,620
in some cases we treat a timeout as they

283
00:13:53,610 --> 00:14:00,089
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to retry using a different query</font>

type or and it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this stuff is</font>

person who is sending the query can tell

that the response it needs to fit into

369
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:08,940
because the default the the implicit

370
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:11,340

<font color="#E5E5E5">and that was causing a lot of truncation</font>

bigger dns x signatures and keys are

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:32,100
and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been gathering strength in the</font>

00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:12,150
by a dynamic dns update<font color="#E5E5E5"> dean for CP</font>

429
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:15,360
capability of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns servers to</font>

430
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:18,560
automatically generate those and you

431
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:24,629
know those records automatically for the

432
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:28,169
dhcp entries we've relied on well the

433
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:31,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">hostname that i gave dhcp 2040 phu kham</font>

434
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:33,810
was really kind of a placeholder as

435
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,670
unlikely the client was going to change

436
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">this hostname to correspond to that</font>

437
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,260
following dhcp transaction so it's

438
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:42,540
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just there to keep get host by</font>

439
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">adder from failing or timing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out or</font>

440
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:46,020
something so if you go to an ftp server

441
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,740
that checks such things then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

442
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:51,510
find something<font color="#E5E5E5"> for their loan file but</font>

443
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,310
the real desire is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client has a</font>

444
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,530
name he knows what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and he would</font>

445
00:21:53,310 --> 00:22:05,129
like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns to reflect that after a</font>

446
00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:07,020
successful dhcp and I think if v4 really

447
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,000
is still in<font color="#E5E5E5"> use 10 years from now you'll</font>

00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:14,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a pretty popular kind of</font>

449
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:18,750
thing to do but in v6 land they have

450
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stateless auto</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> count that is some</font>

451
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,580
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say better than dhcp and but it</font>

452
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,930
also knows that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no server out</font>

453
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,030
there that knows when you have been

454
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:29,660
allocated in a dress so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one</font>

some dns transaction to update your name

457
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:38,940
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely that the dhcp server because</font>

other permissions to go make that update

461
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:51,870
and the view as a stateless all accounts
