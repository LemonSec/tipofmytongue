Hans no more Janice please I can't

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,879
contend with Janis Joplin in order to

14
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,789
say why we did this I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,699
reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> the great 60s philosopher Kurt</font>

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,000
Vonnegut in his book cat's cradle he

17
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,760
posited something he called the carafes

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,860
the crash was a team of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do a</font>

23
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:21,000
those two sometimes it's people coming

24
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:23,220
in like our good friends computer and

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,920

come in to the University of Oregon

29
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,520
we've also had people go out Kurt when

30
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,860
dishes here today Greg<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shepherds here</font>

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,810
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked at the U of L and now</font>

33
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:46,880
they're part of your group where these

34
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,140
state two things overlap is Dave Meyer

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,439
he was the intersection of these two

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,530
choruses initially he's still part of us

37
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,110
he's part of you not coincidentally he's

38
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:02,540
also part of our other co-host today

39
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,539
sprint I give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you Dave Meyer</font>

40
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:15,239
well well what that's not clear I can't

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:20,010
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> type anymore</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I have</font>

42
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:22,019
something much more land than that again

43
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,069
on how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to work so this you</font>

44
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:25,590
did the<font color="#CCCCCC"> welcome that was really nice</font>

45
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:29,040
Lucy um and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted my job here</font>

46
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,239
was really to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host network thing</font>

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,519
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what I'm going to do right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

48
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,019
um first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to walk through all</font>

49
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,459
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did such a great job with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

50
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:37,459
so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do that anymore um</font>

51
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,040
so I'm just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go right and tell</font>

52
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,380
you what the network's about here

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,239
because that's my job basically there's

54
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,829
a lot of fancy pictures out on Lucy's

55
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,360
website of what's there and randy was

56
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:50,519
giving me a hard time about not having

57
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,049
me but I just thought I'm not very good

58
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,870
with fancy pictures that somebody was

59
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:57,870
and then they beasts and it all that was

60
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,250
still oh of course and I'm Joe also made

61
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,569
a really nice map of<font color="#CCCCCC"> where all the</font>

62
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,090
access points are so you can see the

63
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,488
coverage in the hotel which is on that

64
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,700
on that and you but already these are

65
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:12,060
all on whatever my my website there is

66
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:13,888
so if you want them just go there um so

67
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,030
that's um that was where that's where

68
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,470
all the access points are that's a

69
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,120
really nice map because it tells you

70
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,769
where where where this can be coverage

71
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,670
which bar why Joel great job becomes

72
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:25,829
everywhere um this monitoring stuff that

73
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:29,010
Carlos did on that's up here is that up

74
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:33,030
yet coast where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are is it up it's</font>

75
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:35,069
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that site um and all</font>

76
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the information is probably much</font>

77
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:40,440
better collected by Lucy than I and so

78
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,480
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is so just get on Lucy's</font>

79
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,450
stuff on her site and we'll see all this

80
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,709
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so I was supposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

81
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,208
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network and so on i was</font>

82
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,060
building the part of it that I built um

83
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,349
I made my own schematic because I don't

84
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,239
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use any any</font>

85
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:58,679
presentation to us so this is what I did

86
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:03,209
um it's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> or less that's more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> less</font>

87
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,470
what's going on out here basically we we

88
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,870
kind of we kind of have a lot of nice

89
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,090
facilities on

90
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,720
over at the University of Oregon switch

91
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,640
room we have on a sprint router in there

92
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,980
and from there we're driving big ether

93
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,930
down this down to here<font color="#CCCCCC"> on metro on the</font>

94
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,399
you oh and cities Eugene fiber plant so

95
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:21,139
it's kind of nice we have it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

96
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,909
good user down down to hear from there

97
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,710
then down here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a bunch of</font>

98
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,389
switching infrastructure which is go

99
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,799
look on Joel's thing because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has all</font>

100
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:29,870
the nice switching infrastructure but

101
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,300
the schematic is there's a gig<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font>

102
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:36,020
switch on this end of it of the of the

103
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the fiber path there's an intrusion</font>

104
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,469
detection system<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting there which is</font>

105
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:41,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">what kind of I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think what kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of trial</font>

106
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,910
running this for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF right more or</font>

107
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,800
less and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of we</font>

108
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,210
have a router down here with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

109
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,970
interfaces on it so it's a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

110
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,770
thing and then there's a bunch of in

111
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,750
building switching fabric which I which

112
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,979
I will ask you to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lucy's page and</font>

113
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,510
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> jealous great pictures of those</font>

114
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:59,740
because I couldn't replicate those any

115
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:03,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">max at all so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is really this</font>

116
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,150
situation and the router down here is is

117
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,219
it's kind of nice thing because since

118
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,469
we're on all the facilities between here

119
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,830
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> University we could pair it up</font>

120
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:14,270
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the others out there so it's um</font>

121
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,830
it's God's appeared with sprint it's

122
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,810
good and of course we're using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net I</font>

123
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:20,510
got a space than I asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that which</font>

124
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,389
is 236 and speared with my house and

125
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:26,229
gyro and<font color="#CCCCCC"> abilene because we wanted we</font>

126
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:29,090
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put some a ride to debug it um</font>

127
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:31,039
so we wanted to put some we wanted to

128
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">put some mpeg-4 screams out of a balloon</font>

129
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,270
so that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people were kind enough to</font>

130
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,190
route<font color="#CCCCCC"> merit prefixes so that's really</font>

131
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,440
what's going on and since the network

132
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,510
and if you have questions or comments

133
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,699
about it will be glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer any of</font>

134
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,830
those but really the really it's joel

135
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:47,030
who knows the answer to whatever your

136
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,729
question is and that's in general

137
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:53,090
through not even networks just in

138
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:55,039
general so that's more or less than 10

139
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,630
model 10,000 mile you of the network

140
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,639
might you know it took me<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while to</font>

141
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,530
figure out how to get a screen shot too

142
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,840
I don't know how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that either but</font>

143
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,690
so I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say a few thank you so</font>

144
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,070
Lucy did such a great job on it's really
