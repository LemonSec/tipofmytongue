00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just made trouble in the simplified</font>

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:10,920
the brain what happened was we were

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:15,838
trying to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about well great</font>

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:19,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">come forth what was controlling this</font>

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,680
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice we could select embed and</font>

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">projector side very light oh thank you</font>

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:30,980
there we go in almost and so what we did

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,649
is we could put a beacon a bgp speaker

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:37,290
somewheres in the internet and then we

10
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,820
observe its behavior from far away<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">modulation points on the internet</font>

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:49,920
because we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to study bgp behavior</font>

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:51,690
and we figured what we do is we would um

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,449
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for transient stability</font>

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,349
robberies include sleep flaps etc and so

16
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we do is we denounce throughout</font>

17
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:01,949
throughout would become available you'll

18
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,860
notice it was you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know 192 whatever it's</font>

19
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,490
a swamp 24 so it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> visible</font>

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:12,229
everywhere give around<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nazi filters like</font>

21
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:16,919
that nasty guy Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bush puts up and um</font>

22
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:21,530
that's route for an hour drop the route

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:26,340
we draw it that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> draw propagate</font>

24
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:29,750
keep it down for one hour bring it back

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:33,780
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> again throughout should be available</font>

26
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:39,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were oh great we were horribly</font>

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:44,369
surprised the wealth would suppress the

28
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:49,350
route had been<font color="#CCCCCC"> dammed not visible to</font>

29
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:53,549
most of the observation points this was

30
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:57,179
an hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what's worthwhile and</font>

31
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,460
things is to review<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scott</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nara see the</font>

32
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,829
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is bunch of rocks were flopping</font>

33
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,639
rallies were getting too overly excited

34
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:08,489
and wouldn't when taking an acting nice

35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,670
and westerly and making messes on limit

36
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:15,120
and so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 95</font>

37
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,040
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shawn said enough bunch of people</font>

38
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,090
started drafting stuff too damn

39
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,750
throughout<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and your goal is to</font>

40
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,970
reduce the level road and to convergence

41
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,989
time reasonable<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the routes to behave</font>

42
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:33,120
well and punish the ones that didn't and

00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:36,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">Yahoo is there is an exponential curve</font>

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,209
and if you misbehave your tio Pepe punks

45
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:42,060
and once you cross the threshold you're

46
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:44,580
out suppressed and then it decays in

47
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,140
time and gets below threshold which we

48
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,350
used and they're all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> parameters</font>

49
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:54,149
and all this kinky<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff and the two</font>

50
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:57,350
major vendors have is the values of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

51
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,640
constants in their algorithms and

52

they're pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same just a</font>

53
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,779
little different and it's supposed to be

54
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,280
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sweet wats would suppress the room</font>

55
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,069
okay there was the first tooth before

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:20,700
withdrawal or the advertisement etcetera

57
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:24,358
<font color="#E5E5E5">2000 so the third thing you did that the</font>

58
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:27,030
problem is what we're seeing is if you

59
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:29,609
remember autumn Craig stuff of the year

60
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,620
or two ago is let's call out well for

61
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:34,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">the moment i'm calling it a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rigid crank</font>

62
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:39,019
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is this is just a result of one</font>

63
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:42,329
withdrawal withdrawal happened at 1800

64
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:43,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and over the next four minutes is</font>

65
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:48,060
that withdrawal propagates through out

66
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:52,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet we see routers converging</font>

67
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,810
on alternate paths<font color="#CCCCCC"> withdraw happen so it</font>

68
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,030
said oh well<font color="#E5E5E5"> this passes for reference I</font>

69
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,670
can't get there but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> path was still</font>

70
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:06,569
there oops<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't back there there's an</font>

71
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:08,880
alternate path through 5433 20 instead

72
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:11,429
of that at least there's a longer or the

73
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,750
drawn enough in with one<font color="#CCCCCC"> would draw</font>

74

<font color="#CCCCCC">where 30 690</font>

the way these both are within the lab

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:33,070
that's the source origin this is within

<font color="#E5E5E5">the lab this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the upstream is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> P so the</font>

path is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> only fair significant</font>

81
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:46,090
guess is changing you're not far from

00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:49,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point and you're getting dad ok</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting one when one</font>

of the differences the only thurs know

bring a community attribute as a king in

00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:09,789
one side of the 3257<font color="#CCCCCC"> is P as opposed to</font>

the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> until it got a different</font>

90
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,750
attribute marking because the way that

91
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:17,320
is pre-configured things and we saw the

92
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:26,380
upstream from that when suppressed for

93
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:30,730
you know an hour and a half<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

94
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:34,409
why does it happen your exploration of

95
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:38,620
alternative routes what I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> calling</font>

96
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:40,510
how elaborate scry fact it's dependent

upon the topology the<font color="#E5E5E5"> richness of the</font>

100
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,260
are the more likely this is to occur the

101
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:53,670
worse it is where's the lay-in message

102
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:56,099
propagation due to the mineral diver

103
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,150
propagation and rather processing and

104
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:03,700
then there's the settings of the

105
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:07,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">parameters</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I mean hypothesize that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the default settings are too aggressive</font>

107
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:18,960
let's look at what we mean by the

108
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:27,130
results<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can come from on crank that</font>

109
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:30,670
and propagation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> rocks along varying</font>

110
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:34,240
paths to understand a bit more about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

111
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:37,780
this happens the naive<font color="#CCCCCC"> really have of</font>

some connected speakers vgp speakers is

113
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:43,869
an announcement and the withdrawal comes

114
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,150
into this router and it talks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

115
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,890
cloud of routers and if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

116
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:51,010
router there's the announcement there's

117
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">a redraw out of router 17 and here's the</font>

118
00:06:51,010 --> 00:07:00,550
announcement and withdrawal out of

119
00:06:52,570 --> 00:07:03,159
rather 23 but that isn't what happens if

120
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,590
we model this thing and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

121
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,180
looked at it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick</font>

122
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,310
overview of the model in the second

123
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,740
announcement withdrawal comes in here

124
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:15,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if we look at this observation point</font>

125
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,950
we see that announced the draw announced

126
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:23,050
announced announced announced announced

127
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:26,920
withdraw so the one announced would drop

128
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,540
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in Craig and others paper and</font>

129
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:33,850
presentation they did you the other year

130
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:38,250
covers is pretty well but so Tim sets

131
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:42,460
out to model it and he says what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

132
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:46,030
each of these bgp speakers as something

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,370
so we don't you know if there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

input pads too we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know which order</font>

137
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,300
it will take those data disorders

138
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:00,670
importance at all and in fact the

139
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,400
particular model doesn't even care do

140
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:05,590

completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> abstract bgp the protocol out</font>

142
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,729
of this and we just look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these</font>

143
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,429
speakers as blobs that take input

sequences and generate output sequences

145
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:23,200
or you look them up in simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5-piece</font>

remaining good I um change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> algorithm</font>

217
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,689
can you read damping and add that would

just cover was just put them in our labs

00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:19,810
damping fairly far away not all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

260
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,520
there you go you know really let aside

261
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,680
topologically of the internet you're

262
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,620
still going to get down there's a

263
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with changing the constants is</font>

264
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:34,810
this is proportional to distance and

265
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:37,360
richness I the top simple there's some

266
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:45,420
two pages<font color="#E5E5E5"> of references before as all</font>

270
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,070
an interesting question what to do about

271
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:16,230
this but certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the moment the</font>

272
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:18,839
parameters are a bit aggressive and it

273
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:21,959
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if the folk whose</font>

275
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:31,939
the right document would take a look at

276
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:31,939
some data lifeless or these data and

277
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:40,550
give us a good very good ready yeah

278
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:44,250
judgment clarification<font color="#CCCCCC"> done when</font>

279
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:47,910

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:54,180
implications for some implementations

282
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:56,580
but that's it that is wrong from design

283
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,040
point of view actually that's from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Maya</font>

284
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:01,700
study that's not what the code should

285
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,678
behave so let's change the algorithm

286
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:08,730
well the admin actually if you look at

287
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:13,079
it it could easily break it should be

288
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:16,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">for pacifist not predict based and as</font>

289
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:20,698
far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand the code actually in</font>

290
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:23,069
the deployed implementations it does

291
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:26,309
just just that which part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the path</font>

292
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:29,670
hmm which part of that path basically

293
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:32,910
theory is you receive a messy one let's

294
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:35,900
say receive updates for prefix from

295
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:41,670
multiple PS the state is maintained for

296
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:45,330
for prepared for<font color="#E5E5E5"> past her first hot my</font>

297
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:48,809
first hot right<font color="#E5E5E5"> that worked yeah right</font>

298
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,889
if is beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is a need to the</font>

299
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:53,740
very hard to tell

300
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:56,860
yeah but foot stop it is preposterous

301
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,680
that's not what two of the more popular

302
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:02,800
rather vendors are doing I assure you

303
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,720
you're suggesting others are are there

304
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:11,500
actually implementations that do it that

305
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:15,940
way as far as i remember that's what the

306
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:20,950
implementation tasks now these are

307
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:23,260
actual measurements but simulations so

308
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,990
if there is a paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> down here in the</font>

309
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:30,010
references that the simulation this is

310
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:32,020
real basically whether whether she's

311
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,960
happy what should be happening is that

312
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:41,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past that it was packing if taken</font>

313
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:43,810
out of the best math calculation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

314
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:46,889
we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably to notice to</font>

315
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:53,350
verify this I think you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

316
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:56,380
next oops I'm sorry this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike Christian</font>

317
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:58,810
hi my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christian Paradis from</font>

318
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:03,550
Vienna University<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm one of the authors</font>

319
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:07,330
of the right 22 to 29 and their

320
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:10,930
predecessors so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see really a</font>

321
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:13,350
chance to improve the aggressiveness of

322
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:18,160
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> parameters I mean you could do that</font>

323
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:20,080
but when i'm looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at my routers and</font>

324
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:25,660
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> flat damping of my routers I</font>

325
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:28,899
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're very big multiplication of</font>

326
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:31,600
leads between for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the</font>

327
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,280
announcements coming in full sprint and

328
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,879
the announcements coming in through gel

329
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:41,460
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> crossing and other up strains so</font>

330
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:44,710
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a difference of a factor of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

331
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:48,870
over those two powers so I think that

332
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:51,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">both EGP the way of a GPS doing</font>

333
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:54,699
announcements and with Royals and all

334
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,070
the BJP banking algorithms should be

335
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:00,309
changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't see any</font>

336
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:05,470
improvement in tweaking around now the

337
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:07,418
damping parameters probably oh I would

338
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,730
love if he<font color="#E5E5E5"> could if he could improve it</font>

339
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:12,039
that easy but I'm sure it wouldn't help

340
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,429
too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is worth work I</font>

341
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:17,200
agree with you I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the answer</font>

342
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:19,269
yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just by the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way people should</font>

343
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,440
tell you happen to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all but</font>

344
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:23,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not fair for the audience it</font>

345
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,690
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Sri Hari project networks I</font>

346
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:29,230
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to follow up on the comments</font>

347
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,490
what income made maybe I have not

348
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,389
completely understood what the

349
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:36,250
discussion was in this slide even though

350
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:41,889
the dampening<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking what we</font>

351
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:43,690
deployed a code base even though the

352
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:46,959
dampening information is maintained

353
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:50,320
pearl perfect and third path of that

354
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,029
particular prefix if the contents of

355
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,879
this buzzer<font color="#E5E5E5"> stains of what you have in</font>

356
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:57,820
the slide the penalty<font color="#CCCCCC"> is accumulated so</font>

357
00:20:54,879 --> 00:21:02,230
is that what I get who have to discuss

358
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:04,990
this more<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank thank and grr i</font>

359
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:07,929
fancy see I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to add at the</font>

360
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:10,090
ripe ncc rich project has also set up

361
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:12,399
nine beacons and if you want to know the

362
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:15,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">IP addresses to be my person dejan of</font>

363
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:17,469
tomorrow afternoon so lots of data and

364
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:19,629
we still don't understand fortunately

365
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:24,610
those neat things don't seem to get much

366
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:29,129
transit we asked everybody to accept

367
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,129
them and you understand you that yeah

368
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,799
cool
