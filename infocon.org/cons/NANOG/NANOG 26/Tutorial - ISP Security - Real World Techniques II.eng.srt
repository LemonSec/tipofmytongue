1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:07,798
my name is very green and this is kevin

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:11,130
hall and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing a sad</font>

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:14,160
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> two of first part last year was um</font>

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,139
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> IT security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real world techniques</font>

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,698
stuff that's happening out there from

6
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:23,100
the ice key context and for this

7
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,650
audience which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i assume</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody here</font>

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,510
is some sort of operator or associate of

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,028
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> operator or vendor with not working</font>

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:33,480
with operators so we'll be speaking from

11
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,829
the operator point of view and for those

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,599
of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> who have done any sort of</font>

13
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,180
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> service provider point</font>

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,980
of view you'll find that security in a

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,059
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> bar a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point point of view it's a</font>

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,739
little bit different flavor than

17
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,750
security from like an enterprise point

18
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,149
of view so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we made</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up some concepts you</font>

19
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,610
don't really usually hear about in an

20
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:54,710
enterprise traditional security firewall

21
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,960
for the talk this session<font color="#E5E5E5"> came about</font>

22
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,579
from discussions that every now and then

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,230
I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> my colleagues like Kevin and</font>

24
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,780
Rob Thomas and some of the people from

25
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,090
shirt where we're looking at you know

26
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,670
what is different threats out there and

27
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,990
one of the worries of threats are out

28
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,060
there that you hear about all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

29
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,939
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our problem on the edge with our</font>

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,220
customers and in this case the customer

31
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,658
provider equipment edge those small

32
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,310
little routers are sometimes big little

33
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,369
routers on the edge that us as providers

34
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,740
connect up to and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to as our</font>

35
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,450
customers so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be walking</font>

36
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">through in this presentation is talking</font>

37
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:35,070
about these cpe devices and the threat

38
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,670
from them when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they get violated and the</font>

39
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,529
concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is that we see all sorts of</font>

40
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,659
evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these products are</font>

41
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,810
violated people are broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> into and</font>

42
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,810
using for all sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things</font>

43
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:50,130
so on the present where where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

44
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,610
that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't got this already</font>

45
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,960
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got it online to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two sources you</font>

46
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,369
know just in case we couldn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up</font>

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the net oxide already but it's</font>

48
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,829
already on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> N on page so you can</font>

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:08,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">download the slides the Nano of page has</font>

50
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:10,679
the PDF of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISDN Central's fight</font>

51
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,569
has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PDF and PowerPoint so if you want</font>

52
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use some of these slides for your own</font>

53
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,109
train

54
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,850
we have no problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you taking the</font>

55
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,100
power point and hacking it for your own

56
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:23,400
training and purposes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea with this</font>

57
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,620
what the nanog tutorials is to get the

58
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,590
word out<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

59
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:34,590
this in your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> company go for it all</font>

60
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:36,540
right go for it and they give a big

61
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,730
introduction this<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't surf you know</font>

62
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,100
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of like the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun fun part I</font>

63
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,899
know there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a discussions on one of</font>

64
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,150
the security aliases where some of you

65
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,000
was saying you know here's here's what

66
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,830
here's here's an idea for secure and

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,030
securing the internet which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

68
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,230
countered it is but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the</font>

69
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,330
wonderful thing about the Internet is

70
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,280
you're connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to everybody and the</font>

71
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,050
scary thing about the Internet is you

72
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,600
connected to everybody and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

73
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,330
way the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is right and well all</font>

74
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,760
wide open all right to it and that's the

75
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,020
paradigm that we live in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do you</font>

76
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">secure yourself one year in that</font>

77
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:12,330
paradigm so for my isp point of view I

78
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,780
kind of like in express that I talked

79
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:17,940
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how how you know what's</font>

80
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,460
responsibility for providers you know

81
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,100
what are our responsibilities number one

82
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,170
you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect yourself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

83
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,370
protecting yourself and in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> context</font>

84
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,619
is you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that you know</font>

85
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,810
things from otherwise PS and things many

86
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,550
customers don't hit and attack you all

87
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,460
sorts<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the tack factors of that and</font>

88
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,020
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one is there is some</font>

89
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,600
responsibility of help protecting your

90
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,430
peers you know stuff coming out of you

91
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,340
customers and hitting somebody else

92
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,810
across the internet right<font color="#E5E5E5"> forever so</font>

93
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is some responsibility you have</font>

94
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,850
there and then the third one is helping

95
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to protect your customers from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

96
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,859
coming out from the outside world<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

97
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,000
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a bit different from</font>

98
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,530
enterprise or any<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise you know</font>

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,510
you got one connection or two

100
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,070
connections email to ohm if you put some

101
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">firewalls up and you're protecting your</font>

102
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,660
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you just protecting</font>

103
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:09,150
yourself so in enterprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> contacts your</font>

104
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,270
responsibility to protect yourself you

105
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,800
know what a fashion big walls layered

106
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,750
security all those different principles

107
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,910
what service provider it's not just

108
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">protecting yourself get customers and</font>

109
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,870
you got your pubes all right you let

110
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,190
your peers go down well guess what you

111
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have an internet anymore you know</font>

112
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,900
we depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that Parent Connection the</font>

113
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,060
inner

114
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,799
connectivity of everybody so so the

115
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:32,610
responsibility is broader than you see

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,000
in a regular enterprising so so our

117
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,940
focus is is this edge edge between a

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,979
provider and the customer so that's our

119
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,449
context there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things to</font>

120
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,609
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see security but for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

121
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:47,580
session we're just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be focusing</font>

122
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:51,150
on what's going on at this part of the

123
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,000
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and here's what we're going</font>

124
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,190
through with we're going to talk about

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,410
compromising<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're going to talk</font>

126
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,510
about once you compromise the delicious

127
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:02,280
things that can happen there what can

128
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,159
happen with the route injections because

129
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,150
we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of BGP speakers out there</font>

130
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,760
what happens if you play around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

131
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,409
registry information and and then we'll

132
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,750
talk about denial service attacks

133
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,780
directly on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer equipment on</font>

134
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,130
those pug-nosed links<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and so now</font>

135
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the way we kind of do</font>

136
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,289
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as Kevin's going to do but the</font>

137
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:24,300
parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the risk and threats and</font>

138
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:26,009
scary stuff out there you know happened

139
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,830
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> his hat with certain say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

140
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:30,930
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say with sir and then I'll do a</font>

141
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,039
part of things you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually turn on</font>

142
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,720
and things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

143
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,010

00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,760
seen probably within the last year and

152
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:03,210
increase in intruders actually

153

155
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,000
perceived threat of that is when when an

things with it against other sites the

159
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,840
reality is there are there are tools out

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,669
there probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of dozen that</font>

you know there's manual attacks where

people will do a traceroute to find a

particular router those are actually a

200
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:21,920
little more scary in my mind because

201
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,590
that's a targeted attack someone looking

00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:39,050
been a result of of devices that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

them and now that that's easy pickings

209
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:46,490
were for the intruder community in some

210
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,990
cases there's there's compromises happen

211
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:52,690
with weak or well-known passwords and

212
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:55,430
we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few instances of operators</font>

216
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,990
sniffed by an intruder and then and then

217
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,130
the intruder is able to compromise the

218
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:13,190
network in some cases we've had reports

219

were also a threat in terms of

222
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:23,420
disgruntled employees that that may have

223
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,949
privileged access to the customer

224
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:31,819
routing equipment that decide they want

<font color="#E5E5E5">to go in and do something bad impact</font>

226
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:37,340
wise a compromised router is sometimes

227
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:41,330
used for nothing more than writing a

228
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:43,100
text file to distribute to other people

229

<font color="#CCCCCC">execute a DDoS attack we've also seen</font>

243
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,300
and not so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this but we expect</font>

244
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,220
this to increase so it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan for is trust based attacks</font>

246
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,300
once you're into a router you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do all</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that as we go</font>

about what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do about this okay so</font>

252
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,350
from a service provider what can I ask

00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:53,640
you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all this is this going on</font>

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:17,390
here's what you should do to protect

290
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:20,519
yourselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so i've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen some on</font>

291
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:22,939
providers even have a little tool that

292
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,070
they can log into to kind of like scan

293
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,779
themselves right so you can even go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

294
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:30,420
that sort of services as a service

295
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:32,339
enhancement you know and if you position

296
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:34,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">it right a provider can position this as</font>

297
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,930
a value-added competitive service come

298
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:39,060
to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope you secure your network</font>

299
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,410
and of course there's a there's a market

300
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,268
starting to take off<font color="#E5E5E5"> with virtual</font>

301
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,640
firewalls and you know things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

302
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:46,230
in the industry so think about trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

303
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,069
really help your customers protect

304
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:51,930
themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

305
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:55,019
do like the customer security<font color="#CCCCCC"> ilyas get</font>

306
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,859
the word out I mean this is you think

307
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:01,920
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you got mom and pop shop with a</font>

308
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,509
cisco 2600 and it's sitting out there

309
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,349
connecting up there are small little

310
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:10,470
business and do they get notices from<font color="#CCCCCC"> P</font>

311
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,360
third or third that hey you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

312
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,620
a massive snmpd vulnerability out there

313
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,139
everybody should go up there and upgrade

314
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,300
to iOS image they don't get any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

315
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,949
information all right they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't get</font>

316
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,839
that you know they're not plugged into

317
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:24,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they can barely log into their</font>

318
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,100
equipment to maintain it you know you

319
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:27,750
know do things to reach out to them and

320
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them this is something you should</font>

321
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,769
worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right communication you</font>

322
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:34,939
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate with your customers so</font>

323
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:38,279
they have a clue<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on okay</font>

324
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:39,569
policies preparation practice you know

325
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,699
especially the key with the practice

326
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:44,639
start setting up your tools and this is

327
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:47,128
<font color="#CCCCCC">something you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear a lot of</font>

328
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,829
the big providers who have already done

329
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:52,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of tell other providers that</font>

330
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,339
look it can be done there is a set of

331
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:56,759
tools out there that you can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

332
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:59,040
place<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help you mitigate when one of</font>

333
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:03,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">these cpe devices get broken into and</font>

334
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,949
start causing this gift okay so create

335
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:06,509
your policies publisher policies let

336
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:09,479
people know what your policy is going to

337
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:12,689
be if you are the source of the attack

338
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,310
or if somebody is attacking you so they

339
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:17,519
have the contact numbers to reach your

340
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,989
security people I get entered you know

341
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,569
mostly providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked to they say</font>

342
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:23,009
the number one problem we have in IT

343
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:26,040
security world today is they can't find

344
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:27,870
each other's peers well if ISPs can't

345
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,910
find one another's peers will happen

346
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,380
your customers find the security person

347
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:34,380
inside the provider of the buying

348
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,779
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> bomb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so just fine in</font>

349
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,970
the person cigna IST whose job is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

350
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:40,860
security whose job is a poor to access

351
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:43,350
list on somewhere it's been a big

352
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,670
problem and if i sees can't find it with

353
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,949
each other how can your customers find

354
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:48,689
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so getting that information</font>

355
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:51,449
out there putting up on a web page so

356
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:53,910
people can<font color="#CCCCCC"> find it set things up like</font>

357
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:55,859
classification acl's you know it was

358
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,779
amazing like a year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> half ago how</font>

359
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,689
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different ISPs didn't understand</font>

360
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,220
what a classification<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACL was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

361
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:03,360
and whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they</font>

362
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set up a</font>

363
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,140
classification ACL and have them ready

364
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,030
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go I've been scripted have them ready</font>

365
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go like like myself I have a whole</font>

366
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:13,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different classification acls</font>

367
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,180
sitting on my laptop ready to go to cut

368
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,890
and paste<font color="#CCCCCC"> into router configs if I ever</font>

369
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,599
get called in to do stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's</font>

370
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of prepared I can cut and paste</font>

371
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,750
these things in so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like</font>

372
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,530
rocket science it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking some</font>

373
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,850
forth foresight to prepare to do things

374
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,100
like that instead of wait until an

375
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:31,440
attack happens and then figuring out how

376
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,620
to create an ACL to do a classification

377
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,530
to figure out what what protocol type is

378
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,510
being used for the attack set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

379
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,310
like sinkholes which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk a bit</font>

380
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,350
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about set of things like your</font>

381
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">backscatter traceback technique now</font>

382
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,310
these aren't tools that are universally

383
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,740
going to work for every situation but

384
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,969
these are tools like in the poor box

385
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,920
there are some situations what they will

386
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,720
apply the Sun situations they want to

387
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,550
fly but they're the sort of thing that

388
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to build in you have to prepare</font>

389
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,319
for before it happens it's not something

390
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do in the middle of the attack so</font>

391
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,290
don't wait for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack to happen</font>

392
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,910
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait for your customers router to</font>

393
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:07,860
get violated to go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build these</font>

394
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:10,890
tools you want to do it ahead of time

395
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:13,980
all right take like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sinkhole right</font>

396
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:16,650
we get these increase now and we will

397
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:19,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">get more of these are distributed warm</font>

398
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:21,600
sort of tools all right and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Zenon</font>

399
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,250
did you not just microsoft anymore

400
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,170
because we just have a last one with

401
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,420
with with apache and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

402
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:30,719
more of these for the tools out there

403
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,370
that is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a worm that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> goes from</font>

404
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,080
one device to the next device<font color="#E5E5E5"> annex of</font>

405
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,090
ice looking for other devices to break

406
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,770
into and then they're triggered they

407
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:41,070
built<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a trigger to do certain</font>

408
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:43,439
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you can use them to do all</font>

409
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,990
sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things existed you know the</font>

410
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,150
limit is the imagination of the the guy

411
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,580
who codes it of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do</font>

412
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:53,040
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it now you as an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP should know</font>

413
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,720
what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

414
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's happening you should also know</font>

415
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,040
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your customers are violated</font>

416
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,170
all right and one simple technique is

417
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,180
with a sinkhole all sinkhole here is you

418
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,490
got a second interview network designed

419
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,139
to suck in traffic you can use dark IP

420
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,880
space which is some addresses you not

421
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">using you can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some bug on stage you</font>

422
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,200
can use space to just attracts people

423
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,030
it's kind of like on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP equivalent</font>

424
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,310
to a honey pot and sticks on some

425
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:19,139
devices in there to monitor you know if

426
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,490
it's an Apache warm up there slowed up a

427
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,040
copy of Apache in there and see I'm in

428
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:26,010
time to get hit and track who's hitting

429
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,510
you and scan your logs if you want to go

430
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">out there and tell your customers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

431
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,640
are violated that hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you know</font>

432
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">your servers you know compromise you</font>

433
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,090
should go do something about it then

434
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,950
that's your choice if you want to watch

435
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,389
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just see how bad or a problem is</font>

436
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,430
in your network then you can watch that

437
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,160
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> least you have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dab at least get</font>

438
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:46,230
something in place and ready to go with

439
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so you know on track you know look</font>

440
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">at what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could look work for these things</font>

441
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:54,179
now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something you don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

442
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:56,159
wait until<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next big worm to do right</font>

443
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:58,350
you don't want to wait to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next big</font>

444
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,550
Code Red to do something like this this

445
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:03,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">is something you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in place</font>

446
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:06,990
before it happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now you may not</font>

447
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:08,820
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for like six months that's okay</font>

448
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,190
it's there it's a tool it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to go</font>

449
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,320
but then when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can pull</font>

450
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,420
it out and use it and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trick</font>

451
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll be able to have these pools ready</font>

452
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,650
to go so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can pull it out and use it</font>

453
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:21,510
right simple things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

454
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:23,700
providers are always encouraged to use

455
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,250
you know monitor<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers</font>

456
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,270
bandwidth all right now this is

457
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,070
something you should be doing for

458
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,930
traffic engineering just to understand

459
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,820
how you engineer your capacity so you

460
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,210
know what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to ask you eyes</font>

461
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,590
but it also is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a valuable security pool</font>

462
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:40,110
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if you're watching your</font>

00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,730
statistics on your customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also in</font>

one of these worms<font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> popping up and</font>

465
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,540
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at your you know your</font>

weekly customer charts and also and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

467
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,870
see huge spikes on your customers you

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">can actually use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this data to find out</font>

469
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,129
who's actually sending out all this worm

470
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,020
traffic for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Code Red</font>

471
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:56,670
was one of these things where you can

472
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,740
view where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this for the data</font>

473
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,330
and you can see who violated by Code Red

474
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,310
by looking at the customer statistics

475
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,540
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're how awesome they were</font>

476
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,100
like you know two percent a bird

477
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,540
utilization through the day and all send

478

their ninety percent or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> right you know that data kind of</font>

480
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:14,280
showed that and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is stuff you know</font>

any isp who wants to do good traffic

engineering statistic collection you

you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with it you know in a by the</font>

as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed in this last one these are</font>

different guys did different graphics

devices you know FSA's right because as

496
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:53,130
Kevin mentioned people sniff write it

497
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:55,940
and pick off passwords that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok and</font>

498
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:59,730
especially especially if you have a

499
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,740
bandage cpe service all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font>

500
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,080
several the providers out there they

501
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:07,350
keep on questioning worldwide why should

502
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,500
I have to worry about doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

503
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,639
ssh2 magnetic cpe devices out there you

504
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,370
know i'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cross my own</font>

505
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,770
networking routers I go there<font color="#CCCCCC"> I well how</font>

506
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,030
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that your network hasn't</font>

507
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,500
been broken into how do you know if

508
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,540
somebody hasn't already broken into your

<font color="#CCCCCC">knock with a guy who is logging into you</font>

know management<font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't already broken</font>

511
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,230
into and sniffing all these passwords<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

512
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:31,220
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that somebody hasn't</font>

513
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:33,300
already gone in and you know broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device and figured</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out what the</font>

515
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:39,180
password is<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so good password</font>

516
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:42,090
policies using something like that using

517
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,890
like ssh to manage the your CPD devices

518
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,540
those are all you know common sense for

519
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,040
the things we don't see muffled<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

520
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,470
give it an education that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take like</font>

521
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,930
my house right I got good ESL links in

522
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:55,440
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable length right and into my house</font>

523
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:58,740
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cable path is one physical</font>

524
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,900
link and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ESL is writing on the same so I</font>

525
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:04,860
physical diversity into the house right

526
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:07,440
and uh you know I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> control over all</font>

527
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,689
three not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one of them I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed</font>

528
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,210
to have control over but I have control

529
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">over all three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but all you have to do is</font>

530
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,900
download the documentation you know

531
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,670
here's youtube I go to the website

532
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,760
download the<font color="#E5E5E5"> doc how do you do password</font>

533
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:22,680
recovery<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok both</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you do the password</font>

534
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,290
recovery procedures ok all right ok I

535
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:28,230
got control of the box right it does a

536
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,340
provider know that no right because they

537
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,410
don't have anything set up the towel

538
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,240
that I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like you know in</font>

539
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,310
control of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> equipment in my house</font>

540
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,660
right you know but me being a security

541
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">guy you know the equipment sit in my</font>

542
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,120
house I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to have control</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

543
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,789
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if somebody else has broken</font>

544
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,830
into my stuff right so

545
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:45,119
that's what I do it right two of them

546
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:47,609
two of the two of the three providers

547
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,009
have web pages I can go to that says

548
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:51,899
here's best common practices you know I

549
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:55,109
can go to pages and they say here's

550
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:56,428
pages to help you secure your home sort

551
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:58,168
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so two of them have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that one of</font>

552
00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:01,739
them one at one of them doesn't all

553
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:04,259
three allow scooped source addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

554
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:05,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so and I've learned this I didn't</font>

555
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:07,289
plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> on doing this but I learned this by</font>

556
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,239
messing up the route<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my house where I</font>

557
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:10,440
had packets go out one link and come

558
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:13,679
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other one tried this nice</font>

559
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,759
different asymmetry and my kids my kids

560
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,159
were complaining because

561
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:19,200
cartoonnetwork.com website wasn't

562
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,879
working right and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to go on</font>

563
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,340
troubleshooting I got my retinol messed

564
00:22:20,879 --> 00:22:25,799
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> mm oh this is interesting what have I</font>

565
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:29,488
trended around I turn it around so okay

566
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:32,249
you know me mr. unicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> rps and all</font>

567
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:34,919
three sites you know okay this is

568
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:36,869
interesting data point right there's no

569
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,399
messages from any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three providers</font>

570
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:42,359
I never got<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything from any of them</font>

571
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:43,949
about any security stuff going on go

572
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:45,989
upgrade your software<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

573
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,970
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an Cisco I was like one of the</font>

574
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:50,279
guys who like you know with weapons 7 by

575
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:52,109
24 on the SNMP vulnerability earlier

576
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:55,049
this year you know work my butt off<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

577
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:57,059
that and I used this these<font color="#CCCCCC"> three devices</font>

578
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:59,099
kind of sanity check right<font color="#CCCCCC"> your we're</font>

579
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:01,649
going through okay who's vulnerable and

580
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:03,359
author<font color="#E5E5E5"> we even were vulnerable you know</font>

581
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:05,129
the power strip is vulnerable you know

582
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:07,470
is it's pretty pretty nasty little

583
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:09,119
vulnerability all over the place and and

584
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,179
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get anything from any of the three</font>

585
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:14,299
providers that say hey go upgrade know

586
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:17,539
right so if I hadn't gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an upgrade</font>

587
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:20,908
then they'd still be vulnerable now yeah

588
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:22,169
you know hello you know that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just me</font>

589
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:23,700
doing it that means all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

590
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:25,619
customers out there are still with this

591
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,889
vulnerability out there they have not

592
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:32,129
grade yet all right so you know and only

593
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:34,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of them and sister wasn't one of</font>

594
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:35,519
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco we got fixes but I was pretty</font>

595
00:23:34,139 --> 00:23:37,918
impressive another another brand out

596
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:40,919
there I'll you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that allowed a very</font>

597
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:44,039
simple menu that says shut down remote

598
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:45,389
access for all your ports I was talking

599
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">impressive that you just flip a switch</font>

600
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:49,998
and say no and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then from the outside</font>

601
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:52,289
world they can't connect any poor 23

602
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:55,030
port 80 any of that they can't connect

603
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:56,379
in so it's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know ethernet you can but</font>

604
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">upside you can you just say no and then</font>

605
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's done and so yeah that's pretty cool</font>

606
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,419
it's a good teacher you know and that's

607
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,190
something that n the CP each vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font>

608
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,290
so those of you who are vendors you know

609
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:07,750
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your CPD equipment so I saw that</font>

610
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:09,280
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set the note inside Cisco and said</font>

611
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,460
we got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this you know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

612
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:15,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">really this is really easy layman's you</font>

613
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,380
know no access list or you just say<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

614
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:20,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right and then it works it's kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

615
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">a cool cool little thing but so so those</font>

616
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,610
are your vendors go back and see if you

617
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,050
can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy you know if you can</font>

618
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:31,209
type in no and you lock down<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

619
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:33,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">bite some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it some of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes</font>

620
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:34,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">stepside contraries going back and forth</font>

621
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,770
because some of the providers we work

622
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:39,970
with they don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it default you know</font>

623
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:41,350
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know boxes right those have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

624
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:43,650
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis right you know you</font>

625
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:46,810
open up wide open you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know with</font>

626
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:49,030
well-known SNMP ports you can plug the

627
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:51,250
plug it in and automatically configures

628
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,050
but then people don't automatically set

629
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,750
up the security config so it configures

630
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:59,379
an unsecured mode you know you run into

631
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:02,650
that sort of puts obnoxious all right

632
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:10,480
now people who break into it now what

633
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:11,890
did he do yes so once once<font color="#CCCCCC"> ana tutor</font>

634
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:17,830
gets control of a router what can happen

635
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:20,620
in terms of configuration again there's

636
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:23,320
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ongoing development of</font>

637
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,959
techniques and sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of techniques in</font>

638
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:29,260
the underground community in terms of

639
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:34,360
how to alter router configurations once

640
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:37,390
you have control<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one the clue bar</font>

641
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,600
isn't real high here yet but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

642
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:45,880
incrementing so this this stuff's going

643
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:48,459
to get worse as time goes by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the methods</font>

644
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,570
of a configuration are largely through

645
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:55,180
direct access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a compromise box</font>

646
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:57,310
theoretically reconfiguration could

647
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,200
happen through unprotected management

648
00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:03,190
interfaces such as web interfaces or

649
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:07,870
even by SNMP think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> penetrator</font>

650
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:10,330
gets onto one router one CB router and

651
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:11,560
can configure out the SNMP community on

652
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,879
that what's the odds that the same

653
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,710
community string will work on every

654
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:23,650
other cpu router connected to the same

655
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:26,290
network one thing intruders can do is

656
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:30,340
lock out legitimate administrators by

657
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:33,070
changing passwords or deleting deleting

658
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:35,970
cryptography keys or changing community

659
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,929
strings or what what be it and suddenly

660
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:41,380
maybe you have to send a field engineer

661
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:43,120
out to the customer site to replace a

662
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:48,010
router and bring it back home and try

663
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:51,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">and break into it worse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that enters</font>

664
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:53,670
could can and do their talking about

665
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:56,680
methods and techniques for<font color="#E5E5E5"> altering</font>

666
00:26:53,670 --> 00:27:01,470
security policies on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router they can</font>

667
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:04,270
change ACLs or delete ACL such that

668
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,830
protection that the router may have been

669
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,900
offering to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer or to your</font>

670
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:09,310
network from from the perspective of

671
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,740
traffic coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> back from the customer</font>

672
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:18,100
things that were<font color="#CCCCCC"> not permitted suddenly</font>

673
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:21,870
are permitted so that type of activity

674
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:24,879
can broaden exposure for further attacks

675
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:27,820
the other thing to consider is once<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

676
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,360
CP device is broken into it may provide

00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:35,530
a bridge<font color="#CCCCCC"> too for additional</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tax within</font>

678
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,419
the customers domain of trust you know

679
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:39,760
if particularly if a router is being

680
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:42,010
used as the primary security device to

681
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,690
keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet traffic away from the</font>

00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,660
can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to that router chances are</font>

an intruder can get on the customer

694

router you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask yourself that</font>

695
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:16,460
they have the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> path back inside of</font>

00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:26,060
filtering or for IP address restriction

699
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,740
is the only defense there chances are he

700
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,409
answered the question is yes the

701
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:35,920
intruder can get back within back inside

00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:35,759
there's one way another way is to debug

you know one percent utilization you

835
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,810
understand so what can I do with GRE

right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these tricks that we kind</font>

00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:58,250
which is scary enough but as you know

857
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,319
bad routing information does leak out

858
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:05,510
and I'm not touch talking about attacks

859
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:08,680
here mistakes failures bugs and

860
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:10,460
implementations intentional

861
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:13,129
intentionally malicious routing

862
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:15,200
information this stuff has happened it's

863
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:17,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened for years mostly from the</font>

864
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,529
mistakes failures in bug standpoint but

865
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:24,529
more recently we we have started hearing

866
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:26,950
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> incidents where intruders do go in</font>

867
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:31,640
and maliciously modify routing tables

868
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:33,649
and when I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> recently i'm talking with</font>

869
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,870
in the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> three months this is started</font>

870
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,910
showing up in terms of hey I've got

871
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:40,670
access to a box that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a GP speaker on</font>

872
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:42,560
it what can I do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the questions</font>

873
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:44,780
are being asked the knowledge is going

874
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,330
to start being accumulated and people

875
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,950
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> will have more tools and knowledge</font>

876
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:51,710
in hand to execute these types of

877
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:56,899
attacks as we go forward this is a

878
00:36:51,710 --> 00:37:01,850
growth area when you want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

879
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:04,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like so I got our headaches</font>

880
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:09,650
with this has been operational more

881
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:11,630
right so 707 incident I what if 70

882
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:13,460
someone's use it as an attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

883
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,600
so this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of thing we're</font>

884
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:17,480
kind of worried<font color="#E5E5E5"> about now because we got</font>

885
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:21,170
all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-home cpes are violated</font>

886
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,910
and you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know you know</font>

887
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:24,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">how many you've talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to but sometimes</font>

888
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:26,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">I talk to some of these guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see I</font>

889
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,300
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be mopey homes and they have no</font>

890
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,370
clue<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to configure bgp and they kind</font>

891
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,440
of hack it together and it kind of works

892
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:34,759
with them and they're happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

893
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,920
walk away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they don't ever touch a</font>

894
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:40,250
router again as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it works all</font>

895
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,780
right and Kevin boxes like that getting

896
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,580
broken into all right

897
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,710
and this is where we're really worried

898
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:48,650
about with especially your search

899
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:52,280
starting to see these violated routers

900
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:54,560
broken into so for those music<font color="#CCCCCC"> no the</font>

901
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,570
this sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about</font>

902
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,970
this is save down here autonomous system

903
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:02,060
XYZ which down a router and router<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

904
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:04,939
gets broken into all right and somebody

905
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:07,250
on their says ah hmm let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I got</font>

906
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:10,670
what let me let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me advertise let me</font>

907
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:12,860
advertise the entire internet with<font color="#E5E5E5"> slack</font>

908
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,020
twenty-fours so we let me come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

909
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:16,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">little script and like in a UNIX world</font>

910
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:18,560
come out with a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> script to take</font>

911
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,780
our IP version 4 address space and parse

912
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,180
it where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do a cisco config where I</font>

913
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:25,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">just advertise the entire / 24 space</font>

914
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:27,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a pretty simple program a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

915
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:30,200
exercise<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can take that</font>

916
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:32,660
script and log it into a router and then

917
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,149
advertise it out now here's the problem

918
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:37,720
then autonomous system 500 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thomas</font>

919
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:40,550
system 100 what do they<font color="#CCCCCC"> do well they</font>

920
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">haven't put their filters in they don't</font>

921
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:45,020
enforce it so both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them except every</font>

922
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:48,859
single one of those routes more specific

923
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:51,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">its plot out and then of course nobody</font>

924
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:55,010
really does a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of egress filtering</font>

925
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:57,890
with their peers<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so then a s100</font>

926
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:59,210
sense for 300 and 500<font color="#CCCCCC"> sims of 380 starts</font>

927
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:01,520
get property getting around the internet

928
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:02,930
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> always Rob's going out so you have</font>

929
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,759
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> these networks starting to going</font>

930
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:07,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">direct situations is all these more</font>

931
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,340
specifics start heading<font color="#CCCCCC"> out which is</font>

932
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:12,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">situation we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 707 right where</font>

933
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:14,240
you had lots of prefixes spit out and

934
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,790
get propagated across the net and and

935
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,680
you had to rest Cecrops network it

936
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:21,410
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking out the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet but you</font>

937
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,240
had ISPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> and stress he had routers crash</font>

938
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:25,399
and they didn't have enough memory he

939
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,560
had traffic on every different direction

940
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,810
you know you had<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems he put that</font>

941
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:33,170
internet under the rest not a fun sort

942
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:34,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">of situation you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

943
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,410
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I call this the garbage in</font>

944
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:39,290
garbage out you know when somebody sends

945
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:40,490
out garbage and you allow garbage in all

946
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,500
right in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of the garbage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

947
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:45,140
garbage out problem with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and so</font>

948
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,300
we we have operational experience of

949
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:51,259
this with probably you know things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

950
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:53,210
broke now we see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of stuff from</font>

951
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,310
a monetary<font color="#E5E5E5"> motive view because some of</font>

952
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:58,520
the spammers they go

953
00:39:55,310 --> 00:40:00,770
they're in hijack effects and they you

954
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,290
know I know specifics but some of these

955
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:04,460
guys with a what i heard is they take

956
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,840
some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> robberies you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got broken</font>

957
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,300
into and they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the advertiser</font>

958
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:11,120
prefix and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> send out their spam and</font>

959
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:13,700
then they turn it off and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

960
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:16,759
that's how they use for their spam spam

961
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:19,009
box they advertise one prefix send it

962
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,720
out turn it off now they don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

963
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:23,960
get caught<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so then have to go</font>

964
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there and like send all /</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 24 s and</font>

965
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,380
put the inner under giraffes because

966
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,960
your monetary motivation is to send out

967
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:32,330
their spam without getting caught<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

968
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so we are seeing this sort of</font>

969
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:35,930
stuff happening in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sort of case</font>

970
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:38,330
from with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the monetary motivation</font>

971
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:40,310
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> whenever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything like this that is</font>

972
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:42,380
malicious that has monetary motivation

973
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,700
it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of dangerous because you</font>

974
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:48,920
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are making money by doing</font>

975
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:51,770
this so so the good news is is this is

976
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">mainly a BGP speaking router problem the</font>

977
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:56,420
bad news is there a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home</font>

978
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:58,760
bgp speakers out there is increasing and

979
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:01,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> really bad news is how many of those</font>

980
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:04,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-home bgp speaking routers can you</font>

981
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:08,210
type in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco cisco and get into the box</font>

982
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">right remember it's not just goes</font>

983
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:12,170
problem or we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco as a</font>

984
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:14,480
default password but how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

985
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:16,130
do their configuration scripts and also

986
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,930
and they do is type in fiscal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

987
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:19,730
know why that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they type in cisco for</font>

988
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:24,109
their passwords right you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

989
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:27,110
typing in that as<font color="#CCCCCC"> pence per password so</font>

990
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:29,180
long so and then you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the what</font>

991
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,560
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems with with with what</font>

992
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,330
they can do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can you do</font>

993
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,400
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> well the impact is denial</font>

995
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:41,270
prefix hijack and I it's our impact what

996
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:44,390
they what can we do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a number</font>

997
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:46,960
one thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in your spirit filters</font>

on all your<font color="#E5E5E5"> beach p speaking customers</font>

999
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:54,980
it's not rocket science to do that right

1000
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:57,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">so you as a nice piece only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accept those</font>

prefixes that you've allocated to them

1002
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:00,890
or how do you paid some arrangement

1003
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:03,710
because they are multi home with another

1004
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:05,450
provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so so give an example</font>

1005
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:08,480
you take a downstream customer has<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1008
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:14,750
the regional registry is allocated to

1009
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:16,010
you you've allocated to your customer so

1010
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:17,180
you know what they're allocated because

1011
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:19,310
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming from your block that so</font>

1012
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:21,470
we do addressing customers should only

but you know other router configuration

1020
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,580
is very simple you just permit what he's

1021

allowed to send in you deny everything

1024
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:55,250
don't do this simple sort of thing on

1025
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:57,410
their customers right so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the number one sort of thing that ISPs</font>

problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright but then you know</font>

1029
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:07,400
containment filters right so you have to

1030
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:09,259
design<font color="#CCCCCC"> your you network with principles</font>

particular prefix list under customers

1034
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:20,900
they could break<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and we know this</font>

1035
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:23,450
because our number one problem with

00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,819
there fumble fingers and doing something

1039
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">and break in their own network right</font>

1040
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,660
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually our biggest problem with</font>

1041
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,000
stability on the inner is up you know

1042
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,810
breaking our own networks right we know

1043
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,609
there's some different sort of

1044
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:39,710
statistics<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff so it would be very</font>

1045
00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:42,890
easy to see where somebody's gone in and

1046
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:44,869
deleted all the prefix list on a big

1047
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:47,330
aggregation router for all the customers

1048
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:48,650
and they're all gone and nobody knew

1049
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:51,230
about it it has nobody checked the

1050
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:54,170
config and so here you have a you know

1051
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:55,940
several hundred routers customers on a

1052
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:57,470
run router and there's no prefix on it

1053
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:59,359
and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's broken so now somebody</font>

1054
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:00,709
could leak it out and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> through so</font>

1055
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,720
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you look at putting</font>

1056
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:04,160
containment filters in there and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1057
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,720
all dependent and how you set up<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1058
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,540
rotten inside your network where you put

them<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your pops read your nodes back</font>

1061
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:15,230
everybody can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things is when</font>

1062
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,910
you peer with other<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISPs will be pure if</font>

00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:19,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're upstream provider or you appear</font>

1064
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:20,910
with other ISPs or peers as you put it

1065
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:24,090
igri filter there

1066
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:25,500
okay because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1067
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:30,510
should be sending to the rest of the

1068
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:32,250
world right I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sinan routes out to the</font>

1069
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:34,080
rest of the world well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should know</font>

1070
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:36,780
what you're sending out the rest of

1071
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,640
world right and a lot of people I talk

1072
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,770
to you don't know whether sending out

1073
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,299
the rest will they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> send whatever</font>

1074
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:43,860
they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send you know whatever is</font>

1075
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,860
being sent and they get sent out and

1076
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:48,780
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how something like this you can</font>

1077
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,990
lose containment and a problem with it's

1078
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:53,820
caused<font color="#E5E5E5"> by one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your customers will be</font>

1079
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:56,310
propagated out to the rest of the world

1080
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:57,960
all right and again sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> up on this</font>

1081
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:00,360
containment filter again is not rocket

1082
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:03,120
science because here you're allocated a

1083
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,420
block of addresses all right the way we

1084
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,740
set things up with RFC 2050 is

1085
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:09,450
provider-based addressing so you know

1086
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,680
what blocks you have you know what

1087
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:12,689
blocks is supposed to send out to the

1088
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,759
world now some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the big providers</font>

1089
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:16,710
that's a big list what other providers

1090
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,480
who came you start up and underside a

1091
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:20,070
world it's a manageable list because the

1092
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,850
regional registries try to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good job</font>

1093
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:25,470
of allocating within agregue blocks

1094
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:27,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">right but it's something that you know</font>

1095
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:29,069
that your allocated with and so that

1096
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:31,110
gives you a foundation to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> building</font>

1097
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:33,960
it up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with but then the next excuse</font>

1098
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:35,790
people say is oh but you know I got all

1099
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,860
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home customers in their multi</font>

1100
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,870
home with you know other providers so

1101
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,970
you know that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then well</font>

1102
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:43,680
you know actually know you still still

1103
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:45,899
she know what you're going to send out

1104
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,460
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world and if you're setting up</font>

1105
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,200
an arrangement of another provider or

1106
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't one of your customers that have</font>

1107
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,850
some other providers block and forward

1108
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:55,860
with those then you should explicitly

1109
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:57,480
know that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that and</font>

1110
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,700
keep track of them you know you should

1111
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:02,400
have that in a list so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say okay we</font>

1112
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:04,410
have made arrange the steamers and I'm

1113
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,700
allocating these blocks from this

1114
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:07,319
provider and these blocks from this

1115
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,569
provider I know when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be sending</font>

1116
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,710
out again it's something you know you

1117
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:12,420
should know what were you sending out

1118
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:14,610
for the rest of world and if you knew

1119
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that then you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create a tool to</font>

1120
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:20,730
create a prefix filter for the egress

1121
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:23,100
going out<font color="#CCCCCC"> an egress world so so it's so</font>

1122
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:27,240
um you know bigness is not an excuse

1123

i've told<font color="#CCCCCC"> w Isis's is so big bigness is</font>

not an excuse for<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you sent out to</font>

1125
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:34,410

00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,279
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is kind of like you know</font>

1127
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:39,390
things can

1128
00:46:35,279 --> 00:46:43,339
you can do with prefix filtering<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

1137
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:16,169

<font color="#E5E5E5">the only thing available in other cases</font>

1141
00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:28,499
that's the only thing a large majority

1142
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:32,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the people really use so this is a</font>

1143
00:47:28,499 --> 00:47:34,169
bad thing because how many of you when a

1144
00:47:32,609 --> 00:47:36,390
customer calls you up on the phone says

1145
00:47:34,169 --> 00:47:39,390
I want to announce this prefix under my

1146
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:45,058
a s do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do a whois lookup to validate</font>

1147
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:48,900
that they really own it okay that's what

1148
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:51,809
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we're we actually had</font>

1149
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,859
an incident it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the next</font>

1150
00:47:51,809 --> 00:47:56,039
slide but I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about it now</font>

1151
00:47:52,859 --> 00:48:00,140
anyway where someone social engineered

1152
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:03,419
their isp into announcing a / 16 and

1153
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:07,919
someone else's a s through their isp

1154
00:48:03,419 --> 00:48:09,719
they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> and did mail from at the the</font>

1155
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:13,259
region why are and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and change the</font>

1156
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:15,359
contact information free a Class B

00:48:13,259 --> 00:48:19,189
address and an autonomous system number

1158
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:22,199
called their ISP and got it announced

1159
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:24,749
that's bad so if you're using who is

1160
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:28,279
information to validate ownership think

1161
00:48:24,749 --> 00:48:28,279
about how you do in that again

1162
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:35,720
more and that particular attack was

1163
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,460
actually a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago more</font>

00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:40,580
recently there was something on an

1167
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:47,420
track down why some will some

their prefixes to send information after

1170

registries can answer this but some

freezes on critical records so that you

on that one yeah regular area yes I was

1262
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:56,829
thinking like maybe monthly or something

information does not mean every hour

1266
00:54:01,059 --> 00:54:10,119
that's from the perspective of folks

1267
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:13,199
that run the hooah sir good comment some

1268
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:13,199
of the question in the back yes

1269
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:21,620
I

1270
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:42,099
well that's the question is what happens

00:54:40,089 --> 00:54:43,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">if if the social engineering is</font>

1275
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,640
the change takes place meaning it's not

1276
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:56,319
the channel isn't like sending an email

1277

00:54:57,869 --> 00:55:06,670
organization change the information

1280
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:09,940
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's that correct same approach i</font>

1281
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:12,640
think is don't trust who is information

1282
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:15,760
as the sole source of verification in

1283
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:17,109
those types of instances because that's

1284
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,760
not information that you have any

1285
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:22,509
control over someone else is controlling

1286
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:25,059
that information have have alternative

1287
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:26,799
means if it's a if it's a you know you

1288
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:28,750
can do a prefix look up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routing</font>

1289
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:30,700
tables have some little script you can

1290
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:32,859
type come in and comes back and tells

1291
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:35,078
you yes no this is being announced this

1292
00:55:32,859 --> 00:55:36,430
is not being announced currently on the

1293
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:38,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet if it is being announced then</font>

1294
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:39,788
you have to sit back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in question okay</font>

1295
00:55:38,109 --> 00:55:41,920
maybe this is a multi home network and

1296
00:55:39,789 --> 00:55:45,609
someone's asking me to bring it from

1297
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:49,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">another source can i verify that in some</font>

1298
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:51,430
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know what the answer to that</font>

1299
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:56,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is i presume that's that's not</font>

1300
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:58,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">as easy as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i got some some back onto</font>

1301
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:01,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because of helping gift registry</font>

1302
00:55:58,569 --> 00:56:03,308
started out out in asia which is easier

1303
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:04,450
in some of the countries there because

1304
00:56:03,309 --> 00:56:07,029
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their read the way they do the</font>

1305
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:10,058
registries of business so like in the

1306
00:56:07,029 --> 00:56:12,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">singapore context any change records</font>

1307
00:56:10,059 --> 00:56:14,440
going and st nick they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> check</font>

1308
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,549
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the registry of business to make</font>

1309
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,140
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a valid business and they</font>

1310
00:56:15,549 --> 00:56:19,029
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved this is slicing something</font>

1311
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:20,288
like that but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing when you</font>

1312
00:56:19,029 --> 00:56:21,640
do that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of complex social</font>

1313
00:56:20,289 --> 00:56:23,170
engineering where your Forge and

1314
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:26,109
business documents and some of the

1315
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:27,549
things in keeping all that as evidence

1316
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:29,140
because if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through and everything</font>

1317
00:56:27,549 --> 00:56:31,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">looks up and up and you make the change</font>

1318
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:33,160
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody else pops up say hey why'd</font>

1319
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:35,259
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this change you have all this</font>

1320
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,660
evidence you know and then it becomes it

1321
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:39,400
could become a criminal or civil court

1322
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:42,460
case matter so as long as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you keep the</font>

1323
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:45,010
evidence then it's something that will

1324
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:47,410
be taken you know will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a denial</font>

1325
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:49,869
service but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Donald services and dad</font>

1326
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:51,160
images and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> party that was damaged</font>

1327
00:56:49,869 --> 00:56:52,809
condemn<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to do a civil or criminal</font>

1328
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:54,848
case if he comes if you got those

1329
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:56,770
records because if you forge those

1330
00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:58,119
records and there's somebody touching

1331
00:56:56,770 --> 00:57:00,759
those records somebody doing the tact

1332
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:03,700
well familiar with transiting das

1333
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:08,640
attacks from attacking point or points

1334
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:10,538
to some victim point on the network

1335
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,339
actually more and more what we're seeing

1336
00:57:10,539 --> 00:57:14,470
is the victim point<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network is the</font>

1337
00:57:12,339 --> 00:57:16,900
network it's the routing equipment

1338
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:18,970
itself tutors are figuring out that they

1339
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:21,430
can generally have a larger blast radius

1340
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:24,220
and cause more pain by<font color="#E5E5E5"> dousing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a router</font>

1341
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:28,720
upstream from their intended victim than

1342
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:30,578
dossing the victim themselves one of the

1343
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons for that well one reason for</font>

1344
00:57:30,579 --> 00:57:36,069
that is this topology obviously if i can

1345
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:37,960
dodge your upstream router you know you

1346
00:57:36,069 --> 00:57:39,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">know it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to cause not only you</font>

1347
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,349
pain but<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody around you pain and</font>

1348
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:46,029
as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm concerned as a bad guy</font>

1349
00:57:41,349 --> 00:57:49,829
that's a good thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also IP stack</font>

1350
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:51,940
code<font color="#CCCCCC"> path may be more expensive for</font>

1351
00:57:49,829 --> 00:57:54,670
packets directed at the router than

1352
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:56,470
packets going through the router so

1353
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:59,230
these types of attacks tend to be a

1354
00:57:56,470 --> 00:58:02,709
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more painful than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the transit</font>

1355
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:06,099
based das attacks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll let Barry get</font>

1356
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:09,760
into the details of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right so this</font>

1357
00:58:06,099 --> 00:58:12,730
is these next series of wives kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1358
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,289
building<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the case of you know attacks</font>

1359
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:16,390
hitting from from a high-speed

1360
00:58:14,289 --> 00:58:18,789
perspective you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll flip through</font>

1361
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:21,250
all the animation here but<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically you</font>

1362
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:24,160
know if you hit if you hit the router

1363
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:28,950
upstream from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the target you know and</font>

1364
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:28,950
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1365
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:42,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going the wrong way s-sir back that</font>

1366
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:44,230
they're all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no my idea is to</font>

1367
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:46,839
hit the target I'm trying to take out a

1368
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:48,430
website you know I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take out</font>

1369
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:50,770
a website do i<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to hit port 80 to</font>

1370
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:52,930
take out the website no I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know people</font>

1371
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:54,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't reach port 80 it can't reach that</font>

1372
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:56,259
like the address why I'm succeeding in

1373
00:58:54,790 --> 00:59:00,100
my objective I've taken out the website

1374
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:01,750
so and people are realizing that this is

1375
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:03,970
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is things they can they can do they</font>

1376
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:06,250
can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> school</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

1377
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:08,950
so and then we also have these games

1378
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:11,830
that are played were malicious people

1379
00:59:08,950 --> 00:59:14,799
trying to go after each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other to write</font>

1380
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:16,299
so they you know I'm a hacker your

1381
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:18,610
hacker who's a better hacker well I'll

1382
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:20,680
take out your home I'll take out your

1383
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:22,360
this business I'll take you know that

1384
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,520
you got this cross sort of games that

1385
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,990
goes on within the community where it's

1386
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,190
not really trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go after a website</font>

1387
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:33,910
they're just time to go after<font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1388
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:36,250
and see who's better at it so tracing

1389
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:37,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">traceroute really good intelligence tool</font>

1390
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:39,130
to figure out whether the routers out

1391
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:41,020
there you know trace out to a website

1392
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:42,190
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you find out the path to it and</font>

1393
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,509
you say okay these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like</font>

1394
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:45,430
routers each does look like switch

1395
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:47,110
there's a website and then you know the

1396
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:49,750
targets for nut screams to go after<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1397
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:51,870
then some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these to go after they</font>

1398
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:55,120
don't have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> big volume attacks</font>

1399
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:57,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">right they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can just be high pts attacks</font>

1400
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:59,920
so they may not pop up on like a huge

1401
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:04,150
surge of bandwidth because they're very

1402
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:08,490
small packets at a high PPS rate okay so

1403
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:10,120
so as as Kevin mentioned network device

1404
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:11,890
implementations when you're on the

1405
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:13,750
received path that means any packet

1406
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:16,060
that's destined for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network device</font>

1407
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:18,850
themselves network devices have been

1408
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:22,750
built to forward packets through the

1409
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:26,049
device not to take in huge volumes of

1410
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:27,910
PPS rate into device so you'll hear

1411
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:30,760
people you know say how we got really

1412
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:32,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">high PPS rates on LC 1 and a 2 s but</font>

1413
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,360
they have an optimizer box to take in

1414
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:37,000
high PPS rate to OC you want any<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

1415
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,920
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box itself and i can forward</font>

1416
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,380
through it but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take that to it</font>

1417
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,790
they haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been optimized so you know</font>

1418
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:45,220
you do your protection stuff which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1419
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:47,890
different different line of talk so this

1420
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:49,629
again the<font color="#E5E5E5"> package size sort of sort of</font>

1421
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:53,859
attack methods where you're doing a

1422
01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:55,960
higher PBS PBS rates the other effect

1423
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:58,540
with this is collateral damage now

1424
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:01,990
collateral damage you know a nice little

1425
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:04,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">military term this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know where you</font>

1426
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:06,790
know you go after like the cpe device to

1427
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:09,190
take out a<font color="#CCCCCC"> website okay well the other</font>

1428
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:11,859
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do is go after the</font>

1429
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:14,349
upstream router that the CP is protected

1430
01:01:11,859 --> 01:01:16,779
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so i can i can go after</font>

1431
01:01:14,349 --> 01:01:19,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">and be very specific</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and take out the</font>

1432
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:21,280
cpe that supports the website oh yeah

1433
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:22,899
that's like a cruise missile<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacked or</font>

1434
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,520
i can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the old Monty Python skit</font>

1435
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:26,859
and use a tank that killed with mosquito

1436
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:28,930
and go after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the distribution router</font>

1437
01:01:26,859 --> 01:01:30,340
that supports the customer on the ISP so

1438
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:33,339
I'm hitting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISDN to take out the</font>

1439
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:36,400
customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so you know you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1440
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:39,580
your options and it's a character of the

1441
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,710
guy who's attacking for this is why the

1442
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:44,830
collateral damage but collateral damage

1443
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:47,590
is goes beyond more than the attack and

1444
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:48,759
this goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the main reason</font>

1445
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:51,670
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going through the slides the</font>

1446
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:53,680
main reason why I say that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISPs you</font>

1447
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:56,740
have to start doing something about das

1448
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:58,839
on your customers some isp say well well

1449
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:00,399
if our customers get<font color="#CCCCCC"> dost then we don't</font>

1450
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:03,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">see a business justification of helping</font>

1451
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:05,710
them out you know I am take the stance

1452
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:07,810
that I think all ISPs you've got to be

1453
01:02:05,710 --> 01:02:10,359
doing something to help the customers

1454
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:12,880
but it impacts<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network because of</font>

1455
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:15,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">collateral damage at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the pageant right</font>

1456
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:18,040
now then it will happen because the way

1457
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:20,529
the industry is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1458
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:22,990
the key is is one sad off packet goes

1459
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:25,089
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet somebody's got to do</font>

1460
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:27,459
one of two things with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you got to</font>

1461
01:02:25,089 --> 01:02:31,000
terminate that packet or you got to drop

1462
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:33,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that packet they don't disappear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1463
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">right it's just you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know a packet goes</font>

1464
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:36,279
in it'll just magically disappear some

1465
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:38,490
of these you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terminated or</font>

1466
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:42,339
somebody's got to drop it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

1467
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:44,669
terminating takes CPU resources you know

1468
01:02:42,339 --> 01:02:47,950
member resources basic resources and

1469
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:50,320
dropping it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes CPU a sick you know</font>

1470
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:52,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">resources</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right they didn't</font>

1471
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,040
disappear something happens with them

1472
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:56,530
they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so it's a question of</font>

1473
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:58,210
who and where the packets going to get

1474
01:02:56,530 --> 01:03:02,140
dropped in the dos attacks

1475
01:02:58,210 --> 01:03:04,210
alright so here you got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1476
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:06,819
especially with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Diaw stools you got</font>

1477
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:08,920
this aggregation effect when you're out

1478
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:10,930
towards the source of the attack it's

1479
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:13,410
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> light that as you get closer and</font>

1480
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:17,740
closer closer into this to the target

1481
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:20,470
the attack volume starts to amplify now

1482
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:23,279
who says the attack force like a web

1483
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:25,540
server can take that volume of traffic

1484
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:28,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there's a lot of times these</font>

1485
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:30,279
attackers don't go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> and traffic</font>

1486
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,930
engineer the attacks they don't go

1487
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:34,300
through and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I got three tools</font>

1488
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:37,060
here and they have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> much CPU power</font>

1489
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:40,150
and connected at a duplex fast ethernet

1490
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:41,619
connection hence each one I can I'll do

1491
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:43,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">my bandwidth calculations and i'll</font>

1492
01:03:41,619 --> 01:03:46,030
figure out i'll do 60 megabytes per

1493
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,470
second and across my isp i have 192 is

1494
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:49,119
here and things like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> so i don't</font>

1495
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:52,959
want to hurt the isp<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just want to take</font>

1496
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:54,849
out the t1 you know 300 megabits per

1497
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:58,359
second should take out a<font color="#CCCCCC"> to t1 all right</font>

1498
01:03:54,849 --> 01:03:59,859
you know did they don't think this way

1499
01:03:58,359 --> 01:04:01,900
they just go they<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn didn't want to</font>

1500
01:03:59,859 --> 01:04:03,640
take out the guy go get on right now

1501
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:05,680
think about all the damage is doing in

1502
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:07,629
between right they just let's take<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

1503
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:09,790
the website right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is where you</font>

1504
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:10,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">get these situations where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the</font>

1505
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:13,330
tax are coming in from many directions

1506
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:15,129
they congregate on this on the point of

1507
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:16,930
the target the point of the target has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1508
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:18,070
pop that's supporting it right and

1509
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:19,598
that's your pop that's your

1510
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:21,099
infrastructure that's with a lot of your

1511
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,800
customers and then you have this

1512
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">situation where you know I'm throwing</font>

1513
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:29,920
300 megabits of traffic at those key one

1514
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:31,869
right and where's the pockets drop it's

1515
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the p1's about dropping it d1</font>

1516
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:36,160
saturated you know if you ones pushing

1517
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:39,040
and congestion collapse<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

1518
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:41,950
what happens now is you got your devices

1519
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:44,140
in your pop dropping packets<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and</font>

1520
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:45,549
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> those devices the pop would drop in</font>

1521
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:47,830
the packets that could have collateral

1522
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:49,330
damage will call you other customers so

1523
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:50,619
then it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only the customer under</font>

1524
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:51,940
attack colony<font color="#CCCCCC"> which all the other</font>

1525
01:04:50,619 --> 01:04:53,349
customers calling you up say hey what's

1526
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:57,550
going on how come the network is slow

1527
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:58,839
slow right you know your<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks really</font>

1528
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:01,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">slow today how come you know it's</font>

1529
01:04:58,839 --> 01:05:02,500
because your neighbors getting a tax

1530
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:04,089
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this is</font>

1531
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,640
collateral damage<font color="#E5E5E5"> is called a dot that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1532
01:05:04,089 --> 01:05:09,670
callers a das monal going in now it gets

1533
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:11,569
worse because of where you you know

1534
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:16,130
meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out here put my my vendor had</font>

1535
01:05:11,569 --> 01:05:18,440
were you as as then as providers want us

as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a vendor community go down through</font>

1537
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:24,769
this race of competition to see who can

1538
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:27,789
come up with the box that has the

1539
01:05:24,769 --> 01:05:30,828
highest customer per rack unit density

1540
01:05:27,789 --> 01:05:33,709
right how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many customers in a given rack</font>

1541
01:05:30,829 --> 01:05:35,539
unit can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fit and you want it for cable</font>

1542
01:05:33,709 --> 01:05:36,919

1543
01:05:35,539 --> 01:05:38,119
but you know you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow this is</font>

1544
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,680
this where you want us as vendor

1545
01:05:38,119 --> 01:05:41,449
community go so we got this big

1546
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:43,368
competitive race going on right now who

1547
01:05:41,449 --> 01:05:45,019
can get most customers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the given</font>

1548
01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:48,769
racking that means we're having these

1549
01:05:45,019 --> 01:05:53,479
boxes with huge densities of customers

1550
01:05:48,769 --> 01:05:55,488
it's not just like an old you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know 7513</font>

1551
01:05:53,479 --> 01:05:57,078
with with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> cards in it we're</font>

1552
01:05:55,489 --> 01:06:00,079
talking about these boxes that with you

1553
01:05:57,079 --> 01:06:02,989
know 10,000 plus customers on them right

1554
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:04,459
and this is a box that all sudden is

1555
01:06:02,989 --> 01:06:06,469
dropping packets on one of those

1556
01:06:04,459 --> 01:06:08,198

nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand

you know you know or 9999 customers were

1559
01:06:14,089 --> 01:06:18,499
not being attacked being affected right

1560
01:06:16,219 --> 01:06:20,269

01:06:18,499 --> 01:06:22,879
like that happened that's a big outage

1562
01:06:20,269 --> 01:06:24,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so this way it's getting going</font>

in the packet goes down to that t1

1569
01:06:37,819 --> 01:06:43,729
because my btp says<font color="#CCCCCC"> i should go down</font>

1570
01:06:40,039 --> 01:06:46,400
that p1<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i put it in congestion</font>

1573
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,249
so now i flip over the backup path

1574
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:54,379
where's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> das go let's go down the</font>

01:06:52,249 --> 01:06:55,968
backup path what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do there put that in</font>

1576
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:58,579
congestion collapse<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if he goes</font>

attack going on your those big fire

1584
01:07:10,369 --> 01:07:14,449
holes of Dodge packets go hit one pop

1585

two different providers often you hit

01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:34,740
one isp and then easily goes away you

1596

1597
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:39,930
across the internet with an attack so he

1598
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:42,930
used all flaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and then the other</font>

1599
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:46,649
other state of das collapses ok say you

1600
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:48,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit the you know just a non btp speaking</font>

1601
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:50,340
customer all right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a static and</font>

1602
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:52,500
the static is connected to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> interface</font>

1603
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:54,960
and you put the link in the congestion

1604
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,910
collapse and the link goes down because

1605
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">the desk congestion collapse and the</font>

1606
01:07:56,910 --> 01:08:02,190
static crap that's attached to that in

1607
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:04,410
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp or your bgp disappears and now</font>

1608
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:06,270
what is the traffic go it goes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1609
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:08,910
aggregate where do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put your</font>

1610
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:10,890
aggregate you put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your borders you</font>

1611
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:12,299
put in your pop wherever the advert it

1612
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:14,339
is that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack is going to</font>

1613
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:15,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">go I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hit the aggregate and</font>

1614
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,830
then it's going to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then customer</font>

1615
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:18,750
come back up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hit them again and</font>

1616
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:20,729
go back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forth and this is a slapping</font>

1617
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:22,740
it's hitting your infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1618
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:25,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so this is why collateral damage</font>

1619
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:26,849
is real it hits ISPs and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1620
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:30,090
get worse as we get higher and higher

1621
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:31,680
customer densities<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so the key</font>

1622
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:33,090
here to prepare<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this is to start</font>

1623
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:35,490
looking how you architect your network

1624
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:38,490
all right Dolph attacks are never going

1625
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:39,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right I mean here we're</font>

1626
01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:41,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all sorts of things with it</font>

1627
01:08:39,870 --> 01:08:45,149
and people aren't don't want to do

1628
01:08:41,729 --> 01:08:46,410
things like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know validate addresses</font>

1629
01:08:45,149 --> 01:08:47,879
as they come into the network that make

1630
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:49,889
sure the source address is a valid

1631
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:51,870
source address I don't want to do bc p38

1632
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:55,110
for all sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different reasons with</font>

1633
01:08:51,870 --> 01:08:57,870
it everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and this is</font>

1634
01:08:55,109 --> 01:08:59,189
something that that always sexy new you

1635
01:08:57,870 --> 01:09:00,990
know I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to name names but we</font>

1636
01:08:59,189 --> 01:09:03,809
all sorts of them now VPN tunnel and

1637
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:05,160
solutions right you know all are you

1638
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:06,630
know what is the best way of doing the

1639
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,460
VPN solution out there were the

1640
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:10,319
different technologies this affects them

1641
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:12,899
to you know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people say oh I use</font>

1642
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:14,370
this new technology that you know this

1643
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:16,080
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to solve everything and I won't</font>

1644
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:18,990
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security problem not because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1645
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:22,350
know packets got to drop somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1646
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:24,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so so this is something I you need</font>

1647
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:25,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go into so some of the tools that we</font>

1648
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:27,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">have out there today that we know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1649
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:29,490
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know classification HCL's</font>

1650
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:31,260
sinkholes backscatter are some of the

1651
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:33,120
common tools out there we know like

1652
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:34,920
sinkholes and backscatter we know it

1653
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,719
works or walking through with this take

1654
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,149
like remote trigger black hole

1655
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:40,559
last year a lot summer I was in a big

1656
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:42,028
shock when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that that so many</font>

1657
01:09:40,559 --> 01:09:44,788
people didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do this you</font>

1658
01:09:42,029 --> 01:09:47,190
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then you know the last tutorial</font>

1659
01:09:44,788 --> 01:09:49,259
last fall in Oakland you know Chris

1660
01:09:47,189 --> 01:09:52,439
Chris and Brian for unit came out and

1661
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:55,409
was so kind to say look black hole

1662
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:58,409
remote for the black hole works we do it

1663
01:09:55,409 --> 01:10:01,079
at eating it<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright we're able to go</font>

1664
01:09:58,409 --> 01:10:03,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">through a black hole across all 71 72</font>

1665
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:05,280
703 with just one injection and we can

1666
01:10:03,749 --> 01:10:09,090
push the drops out to the edge of our

1667
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:10,920
network really quick the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> limit is</font>

1668
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:14,820
amount of time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> log in and</font>

1669
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:17,039
configure it<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so what this what</font>

1670
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:19,710
this is is basically you you stick a

1671
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:21,030
static route out in the end we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> white</font>

1672
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:22,199
peers those papers on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and you walk</font>

1673
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:24,360
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it briefly you just stick a</font>

1674
01:10:22,199 --> 01:10:26,489
stack route on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge of network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1675
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:28,409
so all the vice<font color="#E5E5E5"> is out there on the edgy</font>

1676
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:30,449
network you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a static route that</font>

1677
01:10:28,409 --> 01:10:33,089
equals<font color="#E5E5E5"> no 0 for a dress that you're</font>

1678
01:10:30,449 --> 01:10:34,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">never going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use so I Chris and Brian</font>

1679
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:36,809
day they have their favorite my favorite

1680
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:39,719
whitey guy like test net you know test

1681
01:10:36,809 --> 01:10:41,400
net is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know special</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

1682
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:43,050
addresses that nobody's ever supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1683
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,789
advertise on the internet and it's a

1684
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:46,469
nice little ass 24 then nobody's going

1685
01:10:44,789 --> 01:10:47,780
to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> you stick about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a static route</font>

1686
01:10:46,469 --> 01:10:50,880
and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of your router's</font>

1687
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:53,610
people know<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero doesn't hurt anything</font>

1688
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:55,739
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it impact your network at all so</font>

1689
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:58,259
here's a security tool you can put in on

1690
01:10:55,739 --> 01:11:00,209
have zero effect on your operations that

1691
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:02,489
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always stick a static route for</font>

1692
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:04,800
prefix and nobody ever supposed to use

1693
01:11:02,489 --> 01:11:07,228
unless they're using a spoofed address

1694
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:09,869
for a DDoS attack London you drop it

1695
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:13,710
anyways<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and then you do your</font>

1696
01:11:09,869 --> 01:11:16,018

1697
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:19,469
who's getting attacked and he's causing

1703
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:30,989

enemy to the edge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my network so i</font>

1705
01:11:30,989 --> 01:11:35,610
take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flash 32 that's under attack</font>

send the bgp advertisement into my

1709
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know with all this</font>

1710
01:11:43,289 --> 01:11:46,650
collateral damage is happening down here

1711
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,599
i push it<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the air to my network I</font>

1712
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:50,759
some the bgp advertisement out and then

1713
01:11:48,599 --> 01:11:54,539
on the edge you know

1714
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:57,119
boom trash can and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1715
01:11:54,539 --> 01:12:00,509
want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the entry</font>

1716
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:02,489
point it can aggregated yet remember as

1717
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:04,130
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> das traffic gets closer to the</font>

1718
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:06,570
target it starts building up momentum

1719
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:10,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right here i push it all the way out</font>

1720
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:11,940
to the edge boom and people say you know

1721
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:13,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">you cannot with this technique you</font>

1722
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:16,768
cannot say oh it won't work in my

1723
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:19,170
scenario I mean come on 70 17 to 27 03

1724
01:12:16,769 --> 01:12:21,119
they are bold enough to stand up<font color="#E5E5E5"> here on</font>

1725
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:22,409
stage this time last year and John take

1726
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:23,940
you can go look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the tape you can look</font>

1727
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:26,610
at the white papers and say it works for

1728
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:28,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">us leather work over them it will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

1729
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:30,030
for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for I can't think of anybody else</font>

1730
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:32,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">it wouldn't work for right so this is a</font>

1731
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:33,360
technique<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just a tool it's not</font>

1732
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:35,460
going to work for every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation</font>

1733
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:37,348
what is a tool if you're sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1734
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:39,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">going like man I need to push this off</font>

1735
01:12:37,349 --> 01:12:41,730
it certainly too bad I mean to push this

1736
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:43,920
off and the tool you pull up the tool

1737
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:45,659
you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't use a</font>

1738
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,670
screwdriver to hammer a nail right you

1739
01:12:45,659 --> 01:12:49,710
know just use the appropriate tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1740
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:53,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so this is a tool to your toolbox</font>

1741
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:55,590
at and all it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes is you know a couple</font>

1742
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:57,750
of scripts or a static route and just a

1743
01:12:55,590 --> 01:13:00,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take a router to be the trigger</font>

1744
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:03,030
router alright so that's the key thing

1745
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,820
is a great option to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add in there all</font>

1746
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:06,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">right sinkholes sinkholes are something</font>

1747
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:08,549
else with different people doing

1748
01:13:06,869 --> 01:13:11,639
sinkholes in different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a</font>

1749
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:13,679
sinkhole is Ford and traffic off all

1750
01:13:11,639 --> 01:13:16,019
right and several providers are using

1751
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:19,170
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's pull traffic off of those</font>

1752
01:13:16,019 --> 01:13:21,150
big aggregation boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so so</font>

1753
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:23,670
here I got a little sinkhole I got a

1754
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:25,679
router out there with a puck pretty much

1755
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:27,599
network that's designed a

1756
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:29,519
traffic will the son of bgp

1757
01:13:27,599 --> 01:13:32,940
advertisement out there so here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

1758
01:13:29,519 --> 01:13:36,719
target getting hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so you know</font>

1759
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:39,018
it's a t1 / point / 42 getting hit you

1760
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:43,469
know nobody can get to one anyways and

1761
01:13:39,019 --> 01:13:44,670
now on this aggregation box I have nine

1762
01:13:43,469 --> 01:13:47,099
thousand customers on there's

1763
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:48,659
aggregation box do I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go in there</font>

1764
01:13:47,099 --> 01:13:51,599
and start playing around with

1765
01:13:48,659 --> 01:13:54,598
configurations when I have 300 megs of

1766
01:13:51,599 --> 01:13:56,190
traffic going trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go down at t1 ok</font>

1767
01:13:54,599 --> 01:13:58,110
so here you have a box<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could be</font>

1768
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:59,159
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> stress do I want to go in there</font>

1769
01:13:58,110 --> 01:14:02,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">and start playing around the</font>

1770
01:13:59,159 --> 01:14:04,259
configuration at this time not advisable

1771
01:14:02,099 --> 01:14:06,210
no matter how big how good you make

1772
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:08,639
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Box community this box is on the</font>

1773
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:12,659
stress let's move the attack somewhere

1774
01:14:08,639 --> 01:14:15,449
else that's designed to do this right so

1775
01:14:12,659 --> 01:14:18,000
I do is I take that / 32 it's getting

1776
01:14:15,449 --> 01:14:21,000
attacked and I advertise<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into machine</font>

1777
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">coal what happens now the attacks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shifts</font>

1778
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,110
the sinkhole so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> party a</font>

1779
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:26,969
network that you put all your forensics

1780
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:29,009
tools yellow sniffles you know

1781
01:14:26,969 --> 01:14:30,329
access-list also with the tools you want

1782
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:33,510
to take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look what's going on with this</font>

1783
01:14:30,329 --> 01:14:35,308
attack right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure the rest of the</font>

1784
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:38,519
world can't get to that website under

1785
01:14:35,309 --> 01:14:40,710
attack that's why scored a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cue what are</font>

1786
01:14:38,519 --> 01:14:42,420
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> services are open to the</font>

1787
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:44,639
customer so you just restored partial

1788
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:46,380
service to your customer you just play

1789
01:14:44,639 --> 01:14:49,679
the attack off of the aggregation rather

1790
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:51,449
you just reduce your risk to all your

1791
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:54,119
other customers as you work in this

1792
01:14:51,449 --> 01:14:55,320
attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright I just pull it in there</font>

1793
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:58,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you pull it into a part of your</font>

1794
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:59,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">network that you've designed with all</font>

1795
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:01,980
your friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> at schools you know a</font>

1796
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:06,090
sniffer you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is some providers</font>

1797
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:10,409
it's a unix box right running<font color="#E5E5E5"> zebra and</font>

1798
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:12,480
doing TCP dump all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dexter extra</font>

1799
01:15:10,409 --> 01:15:16,289
sink hole right they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a unix box</font>

1800
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:18,150
tcp dumb Zeebo and that's what they use

1801
01:15:16,289 --> 01:15:20,159
you know others is an entire network

1802
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:22,018
with sniffers and things behind it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1803
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:23,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and you have to engineer this in</font>

1804
01:15:22,019 --> 01:15:26,789
and you want to do it before something

1805
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:29,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this happens all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right so so this</font>

1806
01:15:26,789 --> 01:15:32,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a sinkhole and remote from the black</font>

1807
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:34,739
hole are two techniques that you can use

1808
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:36,420
to mitigate collateral damage they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1809
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:37,860
use the pole the attacks off the big

1810
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:39,869
aggregation devices and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

1811
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:41,579
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and they both work that</font>

1812
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:43,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are using these sort of using</font>

1813
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:49,650
these techniques out there today<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

1814
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:51,929
so yep the other thing this does if you

1815
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:53,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually want to do trace back it</font>

1816
01:15:51,929 --> 01:15:57,179
immediately tells you which routers at

1817
01:15:53,699 --> 01:15:58,500
your border are are bringing the attack

1818
01:15:57,179 --> 01:16:00,150
packets into your networks you know

1819
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:03,210
where to go look for as without this

1820
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:05,400
technique you've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of trace</font>

1821
01:16:03,210 --> 01:16:06,989
back from from the victim point look at

1822
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,429
you know what interface is this traffic

1823
01:16:06,989 --> 01:16:09,449
coming in you have to branch back

1824
01:16:08,429 --> 01:16:10,800
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whereas this</font>

1825
01:16:09,449 --> 01:16:13,949
immediately tells you where at your

1826
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:16,349
borders the packets are coming in yes

1827
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:17,530
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you add these things together then</font>

1828
01:16:16,349 --> 01:16:19,510
you come up with the

1829
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:20,739
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trace back technique and some</font>

1830
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:22,829
of the other techniques to kind of find

1831
01:16:20,739 --> 01:16:24,638
out okay what are the entry points

1832
01:16:22,829 --> 01:16:26,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">because if you want to go through and</font>

1833
01:16:24,639 --> 01:16:29,500
stop the attack here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull the attack</font>

1834
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:32,679
off and you minimize the damage<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

1835
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:34,239
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9000 other customers in we've</font>

1836
01:16:32,679 --> 01:16:36,250
stored partial service for that one

1837
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:38,289
customer and this last 32 is restored

1838
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:40,840
but then the attack is still in progress

1839
01:16:38,289 --> 01:16:42,849
how do you trace it back to the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1840
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:45,369
origin you need to know the entry points

1841
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:46,900
how to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the point of origin so</font>

1842
01:16:45,369 --> 01:16:48,339
this allows you gives you breathing

1843
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:50,589
space<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that trace back</font>

1844
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:53,800
without having all the collateral damage

1845
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:57,639
how to happen in on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network all</font>

1846
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:59,679
right but keep in mind that what happens

1847
01:16:57,639 --> 01:17:03,130
in reality this hasn't picked up but

1848
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:06,190
attacks rotating shift<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so when</font>

1849
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:07,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">you start doing this you got to be</font>

1850
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:10,269
mindful and keep an eye on<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

1851
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:12,610
because what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen is is the</font>

1852
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:14,440
attacker is doing trace route to see it

1853
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:16,719
a lot of attackers they monitor<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1854
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:19,000
quality of their attacks as they're

1855
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:21,070
hidden right because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> your job is to</font>

1856
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,840
take out the website and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you launch a</font>

1858
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:27,340
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that the das</font>

1861
01:17:29,289 --> 01:17:32,199
the guy is doing trace wraps up his

1862
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:34,150
attack and all sudden you do a sinkhole

1863
01:17:32,199 --> 01:17:36,098
sinkhole sinkhole the attack off that it

1864
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:39,129
often you know redirect<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack off to</font>

1865
01:17:36,099 --> 01:17:41,139
the sinkhole the<font color="#CCCCCC"> price up changes now</font>

1866
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:43,989
goes oh ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok let me shift to a</font>

01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:05,050
new equipment things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that like the</font>

1923
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:07,840
number one<font color="#E5E5E5"> complaint I hear is they</font>

then just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the URL that's on here</font>

1975
01:21:55,950 --> 01:22:01,559
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can count on alright but we work</font>

1976
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:05,130
hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to keep the most special</font>

1977
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:07,470
depressed off of there right so and

1978
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:10,830
that's if people were wondering about

1979
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:12,180
what happened why a you know everybody

1980
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:16,290
is wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know seeing this</font>

1981
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:19,170
Washington Post article on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you know</font>

1982
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:21,210
big serious attack against internet the

1983
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:23,850
most serious ever and you guys are

1984
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:26,850
sitting good luck huh I didn't see the

1985
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:29,280
roots go down you know maybe what happen

1986
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:31,140
is you know these things that happen

1987
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:33,059
against the roots all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time you know</font>

1988
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:35,310
a standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal das attack that you</font>

1989
01:22:33,060 --> 01:22:37,440
see all the time going on usually you

1990
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:38,580
know was on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the forum and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worked it</font>

1991
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,900
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this forum where people found each</font>

1992
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:42,809
other and we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug it up</font>

1993
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:44,670
after all right so it worked reported<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1994
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:46,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">faster but a couple of email messages</font>

1995
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:48,510
got leaked up in the press<font color="#CCCCCC"> corps oh wow</font>

1996
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:50,700
this is juicy and they got you know pat

1997
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:52,770
on the back for you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking the</font>

1998
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:54,120
article and once<font color="#E5E5E5"> one some like</font>

1999
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:55,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">Washington Post right then everybody</font>

2000
01:22:54,120 --> 01:23:00,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">else has got a report against it</font>

2001
01:22:55,800 --> 01:23:03,869
and on so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happened so come</font>

2002
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:12,869
on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then on the email list and now</font>

2003
01:23:03,869 --> 01:23:20,610
we're open for questions yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

2004
01:23:12,869 --> 01:23:22,460
important so using RFC 1918 addresses

2005
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:25,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the private address space on</font>

2006
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:31,260
the that point between yourself and your

2007
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:32,459
customers I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is I think that</font>

2008
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:34,290
is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal preference my</font>

2009
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:37,230
personal preference on that space is as

2010
01:23:34,290 --> 01:23:40,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">much as possible to use unnumbered or to</font>

2011
01:23:37,230 --> 01:23:42,769
use last 31 I've never<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen a benefit of</font>

2012
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:46,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">using private address space</font>

2013
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:49,380
security-wise on my infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

2014
01:23:46,679 --> 01:23:51,630
know the RC says you shouldn't but me

2015
01:23:49,380 --> 01:23:53,520
personally as a network engineer have

2016
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:55,469
never seen a security benefit for using

2017
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:57,780
it some people say oh why can't pink to

2018
01:23:55,469 --> 01:24:00,599
it to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use reflection attacks</font>

2019
01:23:57,780 --> 01:24:05,009
to get to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there's still ways of</font>

2020
01:24:00,599 --> 01:24:09,270
getting going after it I've never saw

2021
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:11,790
where the all you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> manageability</font>

2022
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:12,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it and the extra risk you get because</font>

2023
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:14,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get this stuff where you know if</font>

2024
01:24:12,989 --> 01:24:16,709
your customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> roskilly when they're</font>

2025
01:24:14,369 --> 01:24:19,440
using the RFC you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

2026
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:21,090
designed for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've never it</font>

2027
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:24,570
never nothing's ever convinced me that

2028
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:26,159
it I gained a lot by using RFC 1918 as

2029
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:27,659
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> address as far as my</font>

2030
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:32,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">address is between me and the customer</font>

2031
01:24:27,659 --> 01:24:32,030
so that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my personal preference</font>

2032
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:41,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I've heard arguments both ways yeah</font>

2033
01:24:38,290 --> 01:24:42,790
this blue argument both ways nobody's

2034
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:44,430
been able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> convince me that from a</font>

2035
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:46,780
security perspective it gained me

2036
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:48,370
anything you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in my experience in</font>

2037
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:49,889
building that we haven't seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

2038
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:55,840
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gave me and it gave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me anything</font>

2039
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:57,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and is well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice little</font>

2040
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,410
reflection attacks are increasing out

2041
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:01,870
there and routers are great reflectors

2042
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:03,790
right then you know we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> high speeds</font>

2043
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:04,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">it say how come I got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> calling me</font>

2044
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:06,280
up and saying I'm attack and then when

2045
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,810
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not attacking them and the address</font>

2046
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:09,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">is to give me for attacking our routers</font>

2047
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:11,290
you know what a reflection attack is

2048
01:25:09,969 --> 01:25:12,790
there's different types of different

2049
01:25:11,290 --> 01:25:15,250
reflection techniques depend on a

2050
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:18,100
protocol but you know say like a simple

2051
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:20,080
TTL exploration you know you set your

2052
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:21,520
TTL really low where it<font color="#CCCCCC"> turns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out on</font>

2053
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:23,320
this particular router and then you

2054
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:25,390
reflect it back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> reflects it back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

2055
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:26,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">your target well the source address make</font>

2056
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:28,480
it RFC 1980 address in the

2057
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:30,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure and you take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

2058
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,769
reflux back towards right so you reflect

2059
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:35,010
it back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get lots of these</font>

2060
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:37,719
reflectors out there all right you know

2061
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:39,880
that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a plan an attack to</font>

2062
01:25:37,719 --> 01:25:42,190
get in there because people would say

2063
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:43,900
what if you do that please the argument

2064
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:45,849
when people say is if you use parsley

2065
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:48,339
1918 as infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> addresses people</font>

2066
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:52,120
can't get to it but there's ways you can

2067
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:55,420
get tools you know or like have been

2068
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">brought up if you use RC 1918 as</font>

2069
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:59,739
infrastructure addresses and users

2070
01:25:57,250 --> 01:26:03,150
infrastructure addresses going towards

2071
01:25:59,739 --> 01:26:05,679
your cpe customers on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero length</font>

2072
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:08,110
while you break into at cpe and then

2073
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:12,880
you're into the security domain in there

2074
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:15,130
right so you know there's arguments both

2075
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:16,600
ways you know and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of like</font>

2076
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:20,140
engineer and perhaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineer and</font>

2077
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:21,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">preference yeah I state that because his</font>

2078
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:25,090
engineering preference because on

2079
01:26:21,730 --> 01:26:28,000
traversal sometimes yeah

2080
01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:29,739
the fact that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as you with you</font>

2081
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,830
soon as you turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> are managing the</font>

2082
01:26:29,739 --> 01:26:34,718
dresses on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the landlink you have a</font>

2083
01:26:32,830 --> 01:26:37,090
potential of breaking things like sort

2084
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:40,060
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that them to you for people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

2085
01:26:37,090 --> 01:26:42,730
filter source artsy 1918 ranges so if

2086
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:45,580
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to filter your own and</font>

2087
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:49,299
replied on back to devices that are

2088
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:52,780
going through your number yes so so we

2089
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:55,270
just saying is on the operational impact

2090
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:58,630
of using RFC 1918 and the infrastructure

2091
01:26:55,270 --> 01:27:00,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">addresses is things were like call MTU</font>

2092
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:02,920
discovery and things kind of break and

2093
01:27:00,130 --> 01:27:07,449
then we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

2094
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:09,520
mentioned is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a source we tie backs the</font>

2095
01:27:07,449 --> 01:27:10,780
sculptures and stuff and instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

2096
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:13,750
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customer they can go to</font>

2097
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:15,849
your boxes right because you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

2098
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:17,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">two 1918 was designed for your customers</font>

2099
01:27:15,849 --> 01:27:19,690
right that's where we designed it for

2100
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:21,429
and when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> move it to some place where</font>

2101
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:24,730
there wasn't designed for then we have

2102
01:27:21,429 --> 01:27:26,139
these unintended consequences and to me

2103
01:27:24,730 --> 01:27:27,428
that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the unintended consequences</font>

2104
01:27:26,139 --> 01:27:30,400
build up where it keeps on telling me

2105
01:27:27,429 --> 01:27:32,469
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should not use it there it's not</font>

2106
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:34,330
connected to the global Internet yeah it

2107
01:27:32,469 --> 01:27:41,500
is easy easy quotes to RFC I guess

2108
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:45,610
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this quite quite a</font>

01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:46,869
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a lot so uh so that is a</font>
