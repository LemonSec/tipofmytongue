want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stage as to how we got</font>

31
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,320
to where we are today and why cyberspace

32
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,330
security now has reached presidential

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,619
level and President Bush himself is

34
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,960
interested in what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and is</font>

35
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,880
helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> us move forward on a strategy</font>

36
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,740

defense pretty much as classic that it's

52
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,589
a deterrence mission no different than

53
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,320
what we've been doing many many years

54
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,119
even going back to the Cold War and such

55
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,829
with the nuclear threats but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

56
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,409
that she really wanted to drive home was

57
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,570
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first step in doing cyberspace</font>

58
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,610
security is to recognize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

60
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,780
denial I think security is a non-issue

61
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,760
we can never move forward

62
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,770
knitting that we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and then</font>

63
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,840
figuring out what that problem is and

64
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:21,170
dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is the way to make a</font>

71
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,369

very first time this concept of sector

450
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,160
we've learned some lessons we've learned

i'm going to use a laser pointer<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll do</font>

454
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:41,459
it on both sides this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pad for the</font>

457
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,059
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the verizon building at</font>

00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,859
watching this side of it here we're

the stock<font color="#CCCCCC"> exchange was from the World</font>

465
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:03,238

damage to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> statute to the to the</font>

468
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,699
they cause such damage to the

469
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,319
telecommunications sector that the

470

00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:23,040

476
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,110
crew came down first and it came down

477
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:30,089
relatively vertical when Tower one fell

478
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">several minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later maybe half hour</font>

479
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,959
later the middle part tuned down

480
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,179
vertical that the top part filtered out

481
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:38,790
to the side and in fact it landed up

482
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:40,709
against Trade Center 7 which put Trade

483
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,480
Center 7 on fire a lot of significant

484

486
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,179
eventually fell or when it fell it fell

487
00:16:47,069 --> 00:16:53,488
up against the horizon building steel

489
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:57,509
well fed Center 7 as it came down began

490
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,939
to pierce<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground same thing with</font>

491
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:02,069
towers one and two causing a massive

492
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:03,719
amount of damage underground as these

493
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:05,730
large steel girders are piercing the

concrete well behind the<font color="#E5E5E5"> horizon</font>

495
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,110
building ran a large bundle of

entire bundle

503
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:25,869
severing in half and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happened</font>

504
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,459
that knocks out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stock markets and</font>

505
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,889
knocked off most telecommunications from

flooding most of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> total con doing</font>

plus you have gas and oil pipelines that

are cut you've got steam pipes that were

512

cut an incredible amount of chaos

caused as World Trade Center 7<font color="#CCCCCC"> fill up</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that the switching mechanisms inside</font>

the aircraft went of the Pentagon large

let us know because we're such a large

649

buyer we can push those manufacturers in

we're being if we're being led that way

653
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:30,899
we also want to coordinate research

efforts we recognize that research into

generation of networks and those

into them from the start one of the one

remember they came out of alpha the

people who invented ARPANET is that now

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got the prototype working of</font>

course<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're referring to the internet</font>

665
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:55,109
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> start building</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the real thing and</font>

666
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:56,668
it's very true because 30 years of

667
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:58,289
prototyping experiment and we've got

668
00:22:56,669 --> 00:23:00,629
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that works let's build a</font>

669
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:02,129
proper network now our priorities are

670
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,539
many like any good government

671
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:05,158
organization we have many priorities

672
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:07,739
therefore we can't do one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them well</font>

673
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:09,779
we're very spread out but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very top</font>

674
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:11,879
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> this strategy does tend to occupy</font>

675
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:14,100
most of our time we've also looked into

676
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:15,418
the results after September<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11th of fact</font>

677
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,609
that cell phones have no priority

678
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,230
capability I can't take it they

679
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:21,269
understand our cell phones work I take

680
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,830
myself on it that dollar number I'm

681
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:24,389
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stand in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> line behind everybody</font>

682
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,850
else who wants a channel in the local

683
00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:28,289
cell phone site as long as all the

684
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,908
channels or a significant number of

685
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:31,919
channels of<font color="#E5E5E5"> three I immediately sees one</font>

686
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:34,200
and go forth but what happens in a

687
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,940
crisis like September 11th where you

688
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,679
have thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people trying to seize</font>

00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,739
want to say a hundred from our channels

690
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,289
everybody gets busy signals on the wired

691
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:45,480
side there's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> been programs for</font>

make priority telephone calls wired

694
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:51,869
phone calls so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the FCC to</font>

00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:53,789
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with ways that we can provision</font>

the wireless circuits to also provide

697
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:57,020
priority and there's an experiment going

698

on now in both Washington and New<font color="#E5E5E5"> York</font>

700
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,510

communication system that runs tcp/ip

743

just like the good<font color="#E5E5E5"> old internet but not</font>

telephone network pstn this still relies

747
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:35,120
on the sonnet an ATM clouds like any

748
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,860
other good telecommunication system does

749
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,590
but that's so nice and dispersed now we

750
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,330
can tunnel through it fairly easily we

751
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,919
are again using a maintenance overhead

752

00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,630
cyber side what we'll do with it is

756
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,580
coordinate responses for example last

have an out-of-band system

you know have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> step-by-step instruction</font>

but what we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be ultimately is</font>

790
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,720
some type of road map somewhere that we

can get our nation on the word on the

808
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:37,490
the strategy lips in just a moment so

809
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:40,340
this is your opportunity to help us as a

810
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:42,710
nation put together a proper strategy we

811
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,178
have one to actually issue version one

812
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:46,580
with the president's signature on sep

813
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:48,470
tember 18th but it turned out that the

814
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:50,299
guys across the street over in the West

815
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,340
Wing the lawyers looked at it said it's

816
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:54,200
too big there's too much details besnik

817
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,370
can't sign something like this we need

818
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make it a little more presidential</font>

819
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:59,418
it's too much in the weeds you said okay

820
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">fine we'll go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the drawing board</font>

821
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:02,780
but would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you let us at least release it</font>

822
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,030
for public commenters so we can do that

823
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,710
so we have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really neat 60-day</font>

824
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,240
window that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> participate in</font>

825
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:11,210
getting this thing looking like you

826
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,640
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what we may wind up with is a</font>

827
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:15,919
very short<font color="#E5E5E5"> strategy much like national</font>

828
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,780
security or Homeland Security<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe less</font>

00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,379
but then we have some type of

831
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,590
implementation plan on implementing

832
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,659
guidelines

833
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,309
will be put together by industry put

others that practice this art that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

836
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,668
lead us for with how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement a very</font>

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,500
small strategy again we welcome your

00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:58,169
itself starts off with living a case

847
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:00,299
court action and then it goes through

848
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:03,809
these five levels and it's important to

849
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:05,580
understand why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have five levels first</font>

going home networks I'm sure all of us

856
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,709
have home networks with something we all

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,590
actually starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to become a phenomenon</font>

874
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:54,990

00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:46,980
I think every one of you know where your

networks and your systems in your hosts

930
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,520
are vulnerable from people

your exposure so that when an attack

those come it hits you very lightly and

hopefully your neighbors as well we're

pushing very hard for just this weekend

1199
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:11,410
they have now gotten all the leaders of

00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,510
the APEC countries to agree to a

1201

strategy for security which includes

1202
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:18,130
terrorism not just cyberspace but it's

1203
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,750
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting is that there's three</font>

the APEC countries will agree to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1206
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:25,769
before this time next year

1207
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:28,769
and in particular the enactment of cyber

1208
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:31,348
laws and the establishments<font color="#E5E5E5"> of certs in</font>

every APEC country a very amazing thing

00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:34,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they've agreed to that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they've</font>

00:41:32,789 --> 00:41:38,130
recognized from the leaders level that

1212
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:39,900
this is important now how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you as a</font>

00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:41,910
network operator fit into this big

picture what are the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can</font>

1216
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:48,630
internet was created as a way of just

1217
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:51,000
connecting people together we knew that

1218
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:52,769
we had computers back in the 60s that

1219
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,720
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk but we didn't really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think in</font>

1220
00:41:52,769 --> 00:41:56,578
terms of connecting more than just point

1221
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,558
the point and so the end of the 60s when

1222
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:00,210
the ARPANET came together and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

1223
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we could in fact start creating a</font>

1224
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:04,440
network gluing computers together and of

1225
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:05,910
course Aloha net out in Hawaii was

1226
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,010
building there was time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

1227
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:09,420
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> little islands of networks and</font>

1228
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:10,980
then the thought said why can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1229
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,539
connect all the networks together sure

1230
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,420
go net worth of networks that became

1231
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:18,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">known as the internet but at the time</font>

1232
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:19,319
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea was information exchange I like</font>

1233
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computer to talk to your</font>

1234

1235
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:25,919
academically very open nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really</font>

1236
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:27,839
thinking about security because the

1237
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,130
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked in that world were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1238
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,769
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be friends with each other</font>

1239
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:34,349
this attack mindset that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have today</font>

1240
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:36,078
was not part of the thinking of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:37,710
people back in the 60s<font color="#CCCCCC"> and early 70s</font>

1242
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,109
unfortunately that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1243

today most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocols are open</font>

00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:44,578
that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those of us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> built the</font>

00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,130
responsibility falls upon those who

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually building who built</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the old</font>

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are your fundamental ways of doing</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">business what is your role let's think</font>

1257
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,589
about this per second if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font>

a secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet these are future</font>

1259
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:13,710
networks now because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font>

1260
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,089
future secure networks and we have to go

1261
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:17,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">back and just do the best we can with</font>

1262
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:20,519
the old stuff I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to advocate</font>

1263
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:22,348
ipv6 necessarily because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized it's</font>

1264
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:25,078
a religious war but we do have to have

1265
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:26,819
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> type of accountable addressing one</font>

1266
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,380
of the clear things for security is

1267
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:29,640
recognizing who's out there and what's

1268
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,680
out there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who exactly is</font>

1269
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,480
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to who knowing of course to</font>

1270
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,470
still have anonymity and privacy and

1271
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,599
other concerns we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take care of</font>

1272
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:41,439
we have to have network services that

1273
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,210
can trust each other bgp peers that can

1274
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,710
really no kidding trust each other that

1275
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:46,540
in fact there are who they say they are

1276
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:49,210
and they're not being poisoned and

1277
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:51,550
infiltrated with with bogus<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes and</font>

1278
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:53,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the host set of forging addresses and</font>

1279
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:55,210
all the neat things that we see going on

1280
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:57,099
out there we need user service that

1281
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">authenticated so if i send you an email</font>

you know it really is coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and</font>

work is some type of public key

works pki we know is a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we</font>

1288

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks from the ground up not</font>

added on as an afterthought we need best

1293
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,868
practices we need clueless users to be

into our networks finally we also need

00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,890
to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how we do information</font>

down to certifying companies can we

1310
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:02,470
certify products can we actually if a

<font color="#CCCCCC">the weeds one of the most novel ones</font>

1326
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,720
I've heard so far as states that

1327
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,130
security is really the knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes on around you and</font>

1329

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> creating a world of known</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

1330
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:41,380

1333
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,170
theoretical thing that says if I'm in

1334
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:48,220
state 0 state 1 state 2 i can predict

1335
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:50,020
where something's going to go

1336
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:52,899
but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to an unknown state</font>

1337
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:55,150
I've now become insecure so how do i

1338
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:57,250
create known<font color="#E5E5E5"> states and how do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i operate</font>

1339
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:58,780
within that known state and there is a

1340
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of academic work being done on</font>

1341
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:02,800
defining that because what it boils down

1342
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:05,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">to is how do you measure security how do</font>

1343
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,840
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you really are secure can</font>

1344
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,640
you be sort of secure or is it black and

1345
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,619
white<font color="#CCCCCC"> you either are secure you aren't</font>

1346
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:14,379
big questions we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have answers to</font>

1347
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:17,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">those what about open source is it</font>

1348
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:20,470
secure that's a religious war the

1349
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:22,330
government position on this there is can

1350
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:24,069
we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it certified and again like that</font>

1351
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:25,840
talked about earlier we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working with</font>

1352
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:28,210
my app to see if we can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of change</font>

1353
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,920
the process a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit some more open</font>

1354
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:32,170
source products can go through the night

1355
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,630
process that's what we're interested in

1356
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:37,180
is can we certify it as being secure vs

1357
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:38,770
is it open source of proprietary your

1358
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:40,500
mileage<font color="#CCCCCC"> may vary on this you'll have to</font>

1359
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:43,030
come up with your own agreement on it

1360
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:45,190
then I up itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course just to</font>

1361
00:46:43,030 --> 00:46:47,200
briefly touch on it is an organization

1362
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:49,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's put together to evaluate these</font>

1363
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,250
tools evaluate things for the federal

<font color="#CCCCCC">government and for other governments and</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the federal government but one</font>

program they use open source tools to do

1371
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:09,250
their analysis so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using a</font>

1374
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:15,760
this is kind of an interesting chart

the top for government networks over a

next cycle I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what you're going to</font>

1389
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,689
see is an even larger increase of Apache

1390
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:55,020
and a lowering of I is as more people

1391

get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on board with the apache software so</font>

1392
00:47:55,020 --> 00:48:00,170
interesting set of numbers here

with the individual it starts with

companies and corporations and small

1397

1398
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:12,259
itself it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need it's</font>

00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:01,460
history files because they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1423
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,200
cover something that from the parents

1424
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:04,759
that they forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and delete the</font>

00:49:04,759 --> 00:49:07,220
little history trace where you can see

1427
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:09,288
where they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1428
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:11,089
know most parents don't do that because

1429
00:49:09,289 --> 00:49:12,289
most parents think<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Johnny and Susie</font>

1430
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:13,880
they're down<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the basement there so</font>

from the internet there at discovery com

homework assignments they're causing no

1434
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,749
trouble not like the kid across the

1435

street who's out there running his old

1436

00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,339
my kids in the basement not causing a

bit of problems but what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing to</font>

1440
00:49:28,339 --> 00:49:31,788
educate those tread and what happens

1441
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:34,579
when somebody knocks on the door and

1442
00:49:31,789 --> 00:49:37,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">says</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an FBI badge and says ma'am I need</font>

well Johnny's up to parents won't

1450
00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:55,970
understand that it's up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to instill</font>

1451
00:49:54,109 --> 00:49:59,660
that culture to get it out to build this

1452
00:49:55,970 --> 00:50:01,220
feature of network security so he's in

1453
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:02,960
gentlemen I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask you what all can you do</font>

1454
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,238
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yourself what can you as</font>

1455
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,589
an individual do

1456
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,599
contribute to this culture of

00:50:19,929 --> 00:50:23,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">cor pretty close to a break here I'll be</font>

1464
00:50:22,149 --> 00:50:24,729
more than happy to wait outside the

1465
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:26,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">right up here if you've got individual</font>

1466
00:50:24,729 --> 00:50:29,169
questions well time for a question or

1467
00:50:26,259 --> 00:50:33,009
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we'll open it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

1468
00:50:29,169 --> 00:50:34,859
mr. microphone you can pass around there

1469
00:50:33,009 --> 00:50:36,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">are microphones out there so this play</font>

1470
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:38,558
recognizing that we are all up against a

1471
00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:39,939
break we don't want to take away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1472
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,069
break time we will take at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least two</font>

1473
00:50:39,939 --> 00:50:46,419
questions then I think we have a little

1474
00:50:42,069 --> 00:50:53,259
time is it fun when you come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

1475
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:56,589
mics do tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us who you are hey I mean I</font>

1476
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:58,419
only say that so also a very question my

1477
00:50:56,589 --> 00:51:00,939
name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matthew tank from Microsoft</font>

1478
00:50:58,419 --> 00:51:04,269
early on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a monitor slides you mentioned</font>

1479
00:51:00,939 --> 00:51:06,788
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the joint task force was originally</font>

1480
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:08,979
labeled for defense and now it's for

1481
00:51:06,789 --> 00:51:12,159
operations because you can do offensive

1482
00:51:08,979 --> 00:51:15,158
as well as defensive what kind of

1483
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:17,229
offensive are you well I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1484
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:18,969
curious what kind of offensive stuff are

1485
00:51:17,229 --> 00:51:22,109
they looking at doing in should we as

1486
00:51:18,969 --> 00:51:25,539
network operators be worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1487
00:51:22,109 --> 00:51:27,609
why wireless still long recognized yeah

1488
00:51:25,539 --> 00:51:33,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if you display me yeah I would be</font>

1489
00:51:27,609 --> 00:51:35,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">very worried that the part I will be</font>

1490
00:51:33,909 --> 00:51:37,299
worried about is is the experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> level</font>

1491
00:51:35,979 --> 00:51:38,529
do they understand what they're doing

1492
00:51:37,299 --> 00:51:40,149
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the computer networks don't</font>

1493
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:42,009
belong to the DoD I'm the ones that they

1494
00:51:40,149 --> 00:51:44,109
operate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely but they're all</font>

1495
00:51:42,009 --> 00:51:45,699
interconnected with private networks the

1496
00:51:44,109 --> 00:51:48,098
Air Force for example their networks

1497
00:51:45,699 --> 00:51:49,989
don't extend into Iraq or into some

1498
00:51:48,099 --> 00:51:52,839
other country so what we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1499
00:51:49,989 --> 00:51:54,279
sure then is to keep a very close eye on

1500
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:56,489
what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1501
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:59,139
happens is correct but on the other hand

1502
00:51:56,489 --> 00:52:01,959
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> nations had cyber offensive</font>

1503
00:51:59,139 --> 00:52:03,459
capabilities our<font color="#CCCCCC"> nation has it as well</font>

1504
00:52:01,959 --> 00:52:05,678
it's been behind what we call the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ring</font>

1505
00:52:03,459 --> 00:52:08,019
door for many years<font color="#CCCCCC"> but very dark deeply</font>

1506
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:08,960
buried capabilities just now coming out

1507
00:52:08,019 --> 00:52:10,910
if you do a Google

1508
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,140
social network attack you'll find an

1509
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:14,540
incredible a wealth of<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

1510
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:16,310
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming up I can say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that these</font>

1511
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:18,290
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very well trained individuals it's a</font>

1512
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:20,599
very small<font color="#CCCCCC"> group they are doing what is</font>

1513
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:23,390
proper that's keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> them from really</font>

1514
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:25,550
excelling here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US Constitution</font>

1515
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,740
which is probably a good thing and laws

1516
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:29,660
the keeping within their balance but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1517
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:31,368
is a capability that we as a nation have

1518
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:33,500
to have in order to defend ourselves

1519
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:36,530
against other nations that would try and

1520
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:39,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">take advantage of our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open networks yes</font>

1521
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:43,339
I've seen Calvin for AT&T impressive a

1522
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:45,200
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tsukuba computer security paws most</font>

1523
00:52:43,339 --> 00:52:47,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">network security problems are due to</font>

1524
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,129
bugs in the code and all the network

1525
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:51,500
protocols in the world are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1526
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:54,050
stop that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing anyone in this</font>

1527
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,730
room can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can wave my magic wand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1528
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:57,349
secure all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protocols</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and all the</font>

1529
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:58,849

1530
00:52:57,349 --> 00:53:01,640
buggy software which<font color="#E5E5E5"> and most of the</font>

1531
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:03,349
problem what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the administration have</font>

1532
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,900
in mind for that what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do about</font>

1533
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:08,450
buggy software so that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

1534
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:11,980
do is have some type of law<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says</font>

1535
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:14,689
it's illegal to write buggy software I

1536
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:16,460
can go on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the battery out if you want us</font>

1537
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:17,540
to insightly introduced the bill but I

1538
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,670
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's where we want to go</font>

1539
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:22,759
let us going to take is not the

1540
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:24,349
administration but some companies some

1541
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,170
group of people that are willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1542
00:53:24,349 --> 00:53:28,970
actually try a lawsuit I don't think

1543
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:30,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now against the software companies</font>

1544
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:32,180
because say because many have these

1545
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:34,550
license agreements fury waiting at the

1546
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:36,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom it says by running my software i</font>

1547
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:38,030
hereby absolve myself of any problems

1548
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:39,649
how did that of course you do the

1549
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:41,420
complexity of software there are things

1550
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:42,830
that people will do a software<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1551
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,720
would never thought of by the software

1552
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:47,569
developers but i think the true answer

1553
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:50,060
to it is not today but down the road how

1554
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:51,800
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get the education level way for</font>

1555
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:54,560
example in the civil engineering world

1556
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:56,119
if a bridge falls down we take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1557
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,369
strong look at why the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bridge fell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

1558
00:53:56,119 --> 00:54:00,140
we go back and we rewrite the

1559
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:01,640
engineering books on concrete on steel

1560
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:03,980
it said are learning from<font color="#E5E5E5"> those lessons</font>

1561

perhaps improve the communications with

<font color="#CCCCCC">the government one of the issues I've</font>

noticed is that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out about them until</font>

1603
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:43,629
is there any way that perhaps government

1604
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:46,420
could coordinate with itself a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1610
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,060
was a very good answer for what you're

1611
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying unfortunately the government is</font>

1612
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:01,509
not monolithic we're not you know the

1613
00:55:59,859 --> 00:56:03,580
statistic pyramid with the president

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's happened we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can issue directions</font>

1615
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:07,299
down we are almost like several

1616
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,250
companies that are all kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of working</font>

1617
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:11,890
with each other and competing in this

1618
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:13,690
government states we're trying very hard

1619
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:15,640
because we recognize<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just the</font>

1620
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:16,250
meeting piece of it but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1621
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,290
companies

1622
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,850
want to get in and sell or compete or do

1623
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:21,500
things with the government it's very

1624
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:22,940
hard because there's so many entry<font color="#CCCCCC"> doors</font>

1625
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:25,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">as so many people you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font>

1626
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:27,230
this is why many companies maintain

1627
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:30,049
officers right there in Washington<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1628

employees that do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> dirty deed but</font>

1629
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:33,830
it's on I think what we're going to be

1630
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:35,600
up against is because everyone is so

1631
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:37,850
large and we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> several million</font>

1638
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:50,839
least with the key leaders to find out

1639

who the people are that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

the outreach with and make them

1641
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:56,540
available at a corporate times and we

1642
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:58,520
can't do this of course daily it may

1643
00:56:56,540 --> 00:57:00,560
want to bring some form that we can do

1644
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:02,360
our best with that I'm there in our

1645
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,160
office if we have a group<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming in to</font>

00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:05,900
see us we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> try very hard than right</font>

1647
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,460
others motor officers come in at the

Washington other than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

encourages if you do set up a session

with an organization in DC that you

them there at the same time if<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font>

it's not there's no good answer there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1657
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:28,100
no concrete way we're going to solve

1658
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,560
this except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for just recognizing the</font>

1659
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:33,140
fact that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a problem but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wish</font>

I had a better answer for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks let</font>

1661
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:37,190
me take one more question I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

grandstand here for moments and useful

1667
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:51,560
solace looks over here is you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

I've already been the strategy I have to

00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:39,400
find the quote we are looking at egress

model what you're talking about I'm

1691
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,670
firstly there's a lot of resistance

1692
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:47,500
particularly from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> larger carriers to</font>

1693
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:50,830
egress filtering for technical reasons

1694
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:53,110
but that does not take away from for

1695
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:55,240
local guys your local premise<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reg</font>

router to do egress filtering as close

1697
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,479
to the client as possible that that goes
