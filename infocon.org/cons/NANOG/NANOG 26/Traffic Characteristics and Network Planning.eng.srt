00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:06,839
good afternoon I'm Thomas<font color="#CCCCCC"> telkom</font>

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,189
crossing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a surgeon said the slides on</font>

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,960
the back might be a little bit different

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,420
than the person<font color="#CCCCCC"> I presenting to skip the</font>

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,820
ones oh it's not just that they're not

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,670
say I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even tried yet come on</font>

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,689
some kind try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you won't get this oh</font>

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:22,980
I'm sorry even more<font color="#E5E5E5"> the island</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,720
never mind if you see a slide which is

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,070
not here just skip it and we like one or

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,560
so what I will be talking about today is

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,260
a way to analyze traffic on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

13
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,149
background to learn from what you see

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,760
and actually try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply that in the</font>

15
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:40,739
way you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you planned your background your</font>

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,140
build your network it's supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

17
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> practical approach so anything I'm</font>

18
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,700
talking about you should be able if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,980
run a network to do yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you</font>

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">need any help or assistance and feel</font>

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,390
free to problem you know there's no

22
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:58,289
expensive or complicated hardware needed

23
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,590
or any very complicated mathematics or

24
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,690
anything so please go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and try this</font>

25
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,280
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll share an example from the</font>

26
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,920
global crossing network to see how it

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,720
looks like the study we've done of

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,530
course has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over a lot of</font>

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,530
traces

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,670
this should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be better than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so i</font>

31
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,930
just show one example which is

32
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:28,180
representative<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you see on the</font>

33
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:32,830
network the conclusions are based on a

34
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:34,390
more broader set of measurements but for

35
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,090
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> i show here although you can do</font>

36
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,830
with yourself your<font color="#CCCCCC"> network if you do it</font>

37
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,110
might be different<font color="#E5E5E5"> than scale for</font>

38
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,880
example this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from an ultra 48</font>

39

40
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,509
that when you will see different things

41
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,280
also the oscillation offer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

45
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:59,289
that means what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes down to is low</font>

46
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,630
delay low jitter and low packet loss

47
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:04,479
whatever applications you use whatever

48
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:07,500
as a lace you offer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers</font>

49
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,570
this is really what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to achieve</font>

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,400
because if these three things are met

51
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:14,440
then your customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be happy and</font>

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,360
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rail excuse me to do that it's just</font>

53
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">over provision make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your network</font>

54
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,550
always has enough capacity to deal with

55
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,929
the traffic now i will be using the term

56
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,640
over-provisioning several times in the

57
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,650
presentation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i looked a lot of</font>

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">different inspirations let me be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear i</font>

59
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,209
mean with over-provisioning<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough capacity in the network to deal</font>

61
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:37,180
with the demands but also in three times

62
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,220
and under certain failure conditions and

63
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,650
the last one is important so this means

64
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,150
if single<font color="#E5E5E5"> link first you should still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

65
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,310
able to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all the traffic and the</font>

66
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,950
over-provisioning<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm talking about is</font>

67
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,410
the extra benefit you need some sort of

68
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,268
such<font color="#CCCCCC"> surgical missions obviously you can</font>

69
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,400
let plan for every failure vegetables in

70
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:56,620
the network so something like the single

71
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,780
link failure so but then<font color="#CCCCCC"> prop for all</font>

72
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,239
links<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the network is a reasonable way</font>

73
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:06,670
to start so what we're after here is to

74
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:08,260
prevent significant<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuber look well echo</font>

75
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,809
design has been presenting a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> nights</font>

76
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,370
ago about measurements with it on a back

77
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,959
road network and they have clearly shown

78
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,269
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Copa provisioning work so there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

79
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,390
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you measure over a</font>

80
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:21,910
week or a month you see so less drug

81
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,399
packets and so less data so small amount

82
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">of data that this really works that's</font>

83
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,520
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the issue is and</font>

84
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,780
lots of several presented

85
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,750
probably have already referred to this

86
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,950
is as capital is limited today I mean if

87
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,810
you have the money to build a network

88
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,399
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 times larger than a classic</font>

89
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,570
you need to carry then you're fine you

90
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,540
don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to listen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the</font>

91
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:43,010
scarf and go get some coffee Asha but if

92
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,260
you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more restrictive on</font>

93
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,690
capital and money to operate the network

94
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,670
but you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out this how</font>

95
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,829
much then we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to provision how</font>

96
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,140
big do I need to build my network to

97
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,510
stir the over-provisioning but not too

98
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">much just requesting and so it comes</font>

99
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">down to these basic rules like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great</font>

100
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,940
at fifty percent link load or a maximum

101
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,700
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> shifted 75% link loud in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> failure and</font>

102
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,050
it was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best we can do or when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

103
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,480
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> you trafficking actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

104
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">better so the basic question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is is the</font>

105
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:18,320
background<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic well behaves enough</font>

106
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:21,048
to do very tight planning obviously this

107
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,090
has been looked at before and funny

108
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:25,880
enough a kind of opposite fusion on this

109
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:28,429
topic one is simulation with a very

110
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,640
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic module which is called mm</font>

111
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,110
one killing formula and when you do that

112
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,640
and you simulate how much traffic you

113
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,310
can load on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the link before you see any</font>

114
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">any significant jet affected loss you</font>

115
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,270
see that you can actually load a link to

116
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:44,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">two over ninety-nine percent like the 90</font>

117
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,580
99 percent and still have very low

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,350
jitter and packet loss this that sounds

119
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">really great and it would be good to</font>

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,460
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the feeling that you can't load</font>

your links to nineteen ninety nine

125

view is kind of the surf similarity<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

the peaks are used also that just

132
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,169
intuitively is probably not completely

133
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,969
right if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> link lower</font>

probably some elemental footwear<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

that you can do very low planning us

we're looking at here's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ten</font>

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,840
the data you collect is huge and complex

286
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,110
traffic on average to the red<font color="#CCCCCC"> line which</font>

287
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,080
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you normally would measure in</font>

288
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:23,410
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minute intervals shares an</font>

289
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,820
average benefit of 225 megabits but you

290
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:27,640
see if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 millisecond</font>

291
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:30,040
utilization the piece goes up to 340 and

292
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,140
a million additional 28<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huge</font>

293
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,880
spread in the in the benefits you see

294
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,620
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not necessarily a bad thing</font>

295
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,070
because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all along the main</font>

296
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,620
second level so what we first look that

297
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:43,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">is how to vent with this is is divided</font>

298
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,820
how does the distribution look like and

299
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,860
interestingly enough it almost is a

300
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,750
growth of normal distribution again at

301
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,430
the 10 milli second skill so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

302
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,650
suggests is that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are no</font>

303
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,329
very large speaks on the right side so

304
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,550
very heightened sensations this suggests

305
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the over-provisioning factor is is</font>

306
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,550
relatively small<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's easy to calculate</font>

307
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,959
it doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything apart from</font>

308
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,459
the distributions you need to look at

309
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,830
how are these samples

310
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,570
if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one very high utilization</font>

311
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,910
sample and the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> milliseconds is</font>

312
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,380
high again and high again then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

313
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,900
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> trouble but if you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at 10</font>

314
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,870
milliseconds and this graph<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows and</font>

315
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,240
too skeptical so it shows every pair of

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,130
consecutive than millisecond

317
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,440
measurements and it shows a nice spread

318
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,000
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a local packets or</font>

319
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,370
group of measurements between both very

320
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,590
high so you don't see a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 300</font>

321
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:34,780
megabit and the next sample again 300

322
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:37,030
megabits so all of this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows</font>

323
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,350
that traffic would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely smooth</font>

324
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:41,709
and aggregate very well and

325
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,780
unfortunately the world is a little less

326
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,970
nice than what look from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this graph</font>

327
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,500
because this is almost a 10 millisecond

328
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,630
level so at the milliseconds traffic

329
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,970
looks perfect now we go through in

330
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,860
larger<font color="#CCCCCC"> timescale like 10 seconds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

331
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,440
what you see now again same same

332
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,940
measurements 225 megabits average you

333
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,130
say that the derivations from the mean

334
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,040
are really long I mean this this this

335
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:05,740
line represents<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 second samples so you</font>

336
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,750
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the maximum is at over 200 30</font>

337
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,690

338
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,610
least 230 megabits to carry this traffic

over link over your measurements<font color="#CCCCCC"> of five</font>

340
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:18,220
minutes level which are only 21 or 25 so

341
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,500
on the longer term like the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> level</font>

342
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,780
traffic is really bursty and you need

343
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,570
more capacity than what you can see from

344
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">your fragment measurements so how do we</font>

345
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,640
find out exactly how much more you need

346
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:32,560
we use the traffic we have measured and

347
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,170
we run it through very simple queuing

348
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,119

sample traffic which you will enter the

350
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,970
queue on the right you MTB Q at a

353
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:50,230
several times in the meantime you

354
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,970
monitor how deep the queue is and that

355
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,860
way you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out how much deeper and</font>

how much delay you introduced in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

you would sell your few fully like 350

fix rates

367
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:17,509
now you get to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> club which is kind</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of the key of the story this graph shows</font>

look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blue line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">if I look at the graph it would be</font>

388
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,589
immigrant you see that when you go to

derive in your delay requirements get

390

less strict amount of benefit you need

391
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:17,809
is much less also interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it</font>

392
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,279
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go to very short or very low</font>

all the traffic needs to confirm only

one out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a million package is allowed</font>

401
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:43,040
bandwidth was two and twenty five

402
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:44,749
megabits the bandwidth you need is 257

403
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,969
that means you need fourteen percent

404
00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:51,499
more on the next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> I created new</font>

405
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,959
classic from the samples at much higher

406
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:56,149
rates and what you see happening here is

407
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:57,559
it all again for the five mins second

408

delay<font color="#CCCCCC"> band for almost all the traffic</font>

409
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:02,868
what you see is that when the benefit

410
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:06,350
goes up like 600<font color="#CCCCCC"> Megadeth which runs</font>

411
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:08,149
rg12 level or 960 which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> runt and</font>

gigabit ethernet level or one book<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

413
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:11,899
gigabit it's even higher net you see

414
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:13,879
that the over-provisioning you need for

415
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:16,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">these microburst actually get much more</font>

416
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:18,379
so it goes from ten percent to 625 and

417
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:20,239
when you go to really high speed like

418
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:21,310
like 10 gigabit it will go<font color="#CCCCCC"> down for</font>

00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:25,450
really like

420
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:27,069
one or two percent really well so what

421
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:28,660
do we do with this information because

422
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">just gathering is obviously is not</font>

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of measurements to do and how to</font>

426
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,860
apply them to our planning we've seen

427

00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,459
dynamics and what we now do we summarize

430
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,070
the failures we want a bed for example

431
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,870

432
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:52,420
the network see how the traffic reroutes

433
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,070
and see how much capacity you need so

434
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,779
once you've determined what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

today very good notes about this earth

475
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,230
so the bank is to the conclusion this is

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,700
not some kind of theory of everything

477

out in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and it feels that</font>

482
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,380
you quite easily can find out how much

483
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:50,500
more capacity you need in your network

484
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:52,150
to to deal with my progress from the

and 10 gigabit the open provisioning

517
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,559

518
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,799
but do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these rates are</font>

519
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:30,559
absolute<font color="#E5E5E5"> figures or that those are</font>

520
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,610

521
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,519
instance if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

522
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:37,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">gigabit ethernet backbone as of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today it</font>

might be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast backbone in two years it</font>

524
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:43,070
will be comparable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we had with a</font>

525
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,320
22 megabit a plan for instance a few

526
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:49,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago do you think that these</font>

527
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,740
figures will will stay at the same value

528
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:54,408
that when it comes to percentage of all

529
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:58,970
provisioning or if the environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets</font>

530
00:20:54,409 --> 00:21:01,820
gets faster then then those percentage

531
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:04,220
figures are related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this environment</font>

532
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,840
yeah they definitely depend on the

533
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:07,429
network as a whole and the higher the

534
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,740
link speeds are the lower the percentage

535
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:12,889
gets so on a Gigabit Ethernet this

536
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:15,950
percentage would be higher than it is on

537

20 or 10 big backpack<font color="#E5E5E5"> set your question</font>

00:21:41,389 --> 00:21:46,939
years with the same gigabit back down

548
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:50,720
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the need for other provision I</font>

549
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:52,490
think will be higher than than today why

550
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,929
would it be higher than what you see

551
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:56,029
today because it's the traffic this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

552
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:58,879
based on highly aggregate the traffic's

would the change of traffic the midst of

557
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,748
traffic change in the future if you're

558
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,220
still looking at highly aggregated

559
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:11,409
traffic

560
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,690
I don't know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a feeling</font>

561
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:15,190
I have never investigated what second

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:21,220
difference well Thomas pretty easy if

10 gig in two years you might throw up

567
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:36,340
the 10 gig with say a hundred thousand
