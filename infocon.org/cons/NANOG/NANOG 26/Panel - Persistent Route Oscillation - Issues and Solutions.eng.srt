00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,470
um this is persistent round oscillation

00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:10,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">aid warden perhaps i would like to know</font>

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,700
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people care about persistent</font>

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,009
round oscillation first I guess I'll

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,698
defined it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I do it we have they've</font>

6
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,670
got two hands so good there's at least

couldn't define the problem or compared

about the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok oh boy I've got</font>

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,280
check books that were found in the

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,439
been together and we've been working on

as far as a consensus on on route

understood from the ISP this is

87
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,700
important they don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

under as many circumstances as possible

90
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so here's one example and I do need</font>

91
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">to mention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this may be a bit</font>

92
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,330
contrived it might not be as natural as

93
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,760
some of the examples but in this case

94
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:07,290
the node underneath there is announcing

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,970
egb routes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> c1 c2 and c3 and then they</font>

were announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the respective</font>

97
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,340
routing reflectors and then route the

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:18,690
route reflectors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suppose r1 r2 and</font>

99
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,880
r3 actually then advertise their clients

100
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,620
for us to each other the reflectors we

101
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,200
compute the route to them withdraw their

102
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,840
advertisement this was the bulbs in the

103
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,219
eventual removal and

104
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,929
this goes through and through so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

105
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:35,189
comprising example but it shows you that

106
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:38,219
due to this interaction between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

107
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:41,400
enemy the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP statistics</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and rot</font>

108
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:44,099
reflection you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have over</font>

109
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,138
reduction and you can have the

110
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:51,539
oscillation now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my favorite</font>

111
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:52,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">example this is from RFC 3375</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

112
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:54,870
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't my other thing</font>

113
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,330
when i looked at the RFC going to find

114
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,349
all of this example now this has to do

115
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:03,479
with the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing</font>

116
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:05,310
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using it in dbgap anything on</font>

117
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,919
through actually looking at the AAS pass

118
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,280
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> m ed so for example the initial</font>

119
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:14,818
route comes into a and b are sea RB and

120
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:18,568
RC and in that case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have gotten it</font>

121
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:21,120
from a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> AAS so you don't</font>

122
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:23,099
compare the m.ed election to use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

123
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,669
metrics which is four and five to

00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:33,599
compare it and select our see our CSM<font color="#E5E5E5"> rd</font>

125
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">rd then turns around and flex our e well</font>

126
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:40,830
then RA and<font color="#E5E5E5"> rd amounts each other's</font>

127
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:44,719
routes and ra computes the best route

128
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:49,169
because now RA has our<font color="#CCCCCC"> e which has six</font>

129
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:53,400
has a previous a ss6 and our a has a

00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:57,900
previous ages of six and select via the

131
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:00,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">meed which two picks up re r e then says</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay i'm going to announce each other</font>

133
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:09,300
and you end up selecting our e<font color="#E5E5E5"> r is then</font>

134
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:14,818
sent back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> RB in our ear are compared</font>

135
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:20,750
and you then select the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact you should</font>

136
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:26,250
reduce our<font color="#CCCCCC"> B then come back and say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

e<font color="#CCCCCC"> reverse ra to reduce that and again</font>

138
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,529
you come back to where you want to

139
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,000
reduce our e you have RB and RC<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

140
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:35,099
and then the whole pattern starts over

141
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,440
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the RC or if you look at</font>

142
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:40,050
my improved slides which didn't make it

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,129
up here tonight this afternoon

144
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,699
we'll go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> these particular</font>

145
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:48,930
sequences so the withdrawal<font color="#CCCCCC"> of corporate</font>

146
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:50,729
for the route oscillation so when we see

147
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">GP updates come some timing of the</font>

148
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:54,568
circular redundancy you have a

149
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,060
restriction of information by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the router</font>

150
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:59,909
section of<font color="#CCCCCC"> confederation and you have a</font>

151
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,430
partial ordering through the emmy gee so

152
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:04,349
this route selection is over sensitive

153
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:06,840
to the route information it seems to

154
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:08,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">play arrest a role that we might not</font>

155
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,859
have intended when we first started<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

156
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,960
with multi exit we were just<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

157
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,050
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we could pick between an</font>

158
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:20,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ethernet and perhaps a fair link or</font>

159
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:25,949
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was less bandwidth ready</font>

160
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:28,500
so right now one really can't kind of

161
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:31,560
the changes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> principal protocol</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

162
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">the deployed base so why are we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

163
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much saying route reflectors here</font>

164
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,409
this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> two of asking</font>

165
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,539
Federation's in principle they can be

166
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:41,639
equivalent because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can treat our</font>

167
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:43,440
border routers and Confederations as

168
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,680
route reflectors in<font color="#CCCCCC"> their ibgp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

169
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,569
clients and so the Confederation ebgp is

170
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,370
non-compliant so it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

171
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:53,990
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually find the same</font>

172
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,990
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reduction of information</font>

173
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,770
Confederations are usually deployed

174
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:00,960
there's a two level hierarchy and the

175
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">ABS RS are fully</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nestle again you lose</font>

176
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,000
information which probably is what's

177
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">happening to your brain right now if you</font>

178
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">look if you go later and pick up the</font>

179
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:15,750
improve slides we didn't get up you'll

180
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,219
find that you can walk through it or you

181
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,650
walk through the our feet because this

182
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:22,199
problem although interesting is probably

183
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,789
a difficult one to watch there are two

184
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,979
solutions that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look at</font>

185
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:28,409
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> path solution that</font>

186
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:30,300
anchor has and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> multipath and we'll</font>

187
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:33,409
talk about the route oscillation

188
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,409
detection and deployment

189
00:08:51,510 --> 00:09:03,430
ok so my presentation focuses on the

190
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:05,949
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> path solution yeah and yeah</font>

191
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,410
actually this some of this point sadness

192
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:12,100
have been basically just talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

193
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:15,069
super sleuths life so here there let's

194
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,370
look at it they are couple observations

195
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,050
are rising flexion and also their guys

196
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,260
involving<font color="#E5E5E5"> the at the right blood</font>

197
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,390
oscillation so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is that</font>

198
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,029
the currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right reflector all</font>

199
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:30,610
these insects are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best path for me</font>

200
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:32,800
for what it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if that if the</font>

201
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,770
best path for a while at least somewhat

202
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,859
non Clyde appear is basically from

203
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:41,079
another cluster and then the screws into

204
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">gardening sector will not advertise any</font>

205
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:48,820
of its<font color="#E5E5E5"> flight path to the two other</font>

206
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:51,370
clusters so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> way if it has it let's</font>

207
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:54,160
turn to the sequence of events<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

208
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:56,709
class class has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been advertised to other</font>

209
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,100
clusters that path needs to be this<font color="#E5E5E5"> pool</font>

210
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:03,250
because it only reflects the best path

211
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,800
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and reward the glide path is</font>

212
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:08,020
still valid and is still available on

213
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,680
the reflector a diving information may

214
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:14,680
not be made available to other clusters

217
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,600
first case in particular if it is a

218

beast or by the rudras letter that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

219
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,330
contribute even have the tracks watching

information from other clusters and

221
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:38,050
there so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists over reduction of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">rotten information by writing section if</font>

you compare<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the case of a former a</font>

full rbgfe mesh another observation is

225
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:52,060
that and let me notify the right

226
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,670
reflection the world of light reflection

227
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:58,859
to make it Amelia<font color="#E5E5E5"> path between a client</font>

228
00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:01,150
and non clients Adnan Clyde peers then

229
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,820
we can basically increase

230
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:07,120
watching information that's available in

231
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:10,630
the network and so damn happy Houston

232
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:15,390
has a fascination so that's a basic

233
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:20,200
observation and and the he was a simple

234
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:24,910
proposal that basically 46 and basically

235
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:28,180
the idea is that your idea is to allow a

236
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:31,420
reflector to advertise differences of

237
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,420
rocky information to work decent types

238
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:36,370
of peers more specifically when we

239
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,400
advertise rotting information to a

240
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:41,860
client basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> advertise the rod from</font>

241
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,160

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> from another cluster bleep ass</font>

251
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,170
we should advertise the best pass the

otherwise<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention the advertiser good</font>

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,960
that's it all right

290
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,730
okay so

291
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:55,060
anchors talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of most</font>

292
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:59,480
backwards of that will hack that

294
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,150
words of them now is some work that my

295
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,609
co-authors and I did to think about well

296
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:09,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">what happens if we don't want to you</font>

297
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:13,480
know just kind of improve things but we

298
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,480
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix the problem all together</font>

299
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:27,710
like up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so just to recap</font>

300
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:32,420
what are the factors that make BJP

301
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:35,830
oscillate it all basically boils down to

302
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:38,479
ten things one is information hiding

303
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,760
which when the GP was originally

304
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,830
invented there was no notion of<font color="#CCCCCC"> BP</font>

305
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:47,240
hierarchy and so it's not really

306
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:50,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">surprising that bgp isn't robust in the</font>

307
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:53,150
face of not having complete information

308
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:56,510
and then to make matters worse we've got

309
00:15:53,150 --> 00:16:01,100
this partial rivering thing with envy so

310
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:04,430
we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to fix all this so a</font>

311
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:06,890
few observations first full match ibgp

312
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,709
doesn't oscillate um and that's because

313
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,960
all the routers in the internet work

314
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:17,030
have what passes for complete

315
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:21,080
information so QED we need more

316
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:26,410
information in the network sometimes to

317
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:29,960
suppress oscillation so since hierarchy

318
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:33,860
is all about hiding information what are

319
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:36,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">we going to do we need to innovate a</font>

321

IBG team

329
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:04,470
so the proposal we came up with is

330
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:07,949
really a proposal in two parts the first

331
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:10,889
part is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> extension to the protocol</font>

332
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:12,980
which allows us to advertise multiple

333
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:15,388
paths without the implicit withdrawal

334
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,519
behavior that's in the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

335
00:17:15,388 --> 00:17:21,500
protocol and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an</font>

336
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:24,899
infrastructural thing it can be used for

337
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:26,909
eliminating churn by advertising

338
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:29,219
additional pads it can also be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

339
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:30,179
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe we be useful</font>

340
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,529
also and I'll touch on that briefly

341
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:38,820
later now the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> part is given that</font>

342
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:41,639
infrastructural piece what you want to

343
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,840
do is at the route reflector<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just</font>

00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:51,049
you can equal apply this anything that

below the Med step so calm that lets you

00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:21,059
prune the the rotting where the men are

357
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,709

358
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:27,269
other refinements that could also be

pursued the general apply to both this

360

approach and what anchor presented for

example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use something dynamic</font>

362

with detection of oscillating routes and

00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,070
only apply the algorithm to that it's

364
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:45,570
arguable whether you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that or</font>

365
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:47,908
not so and i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font>

00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:52,139
that for the extension itself you can

368
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:53,429
look at the drafts which are referenced

what are the benefits we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get from this</font>

379
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,020
still some basic fundamental topological

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,449
constraints having through the

381
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:30,710
reasonable network design but it if we

can do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> track</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of advertising extra</font>

383
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:36,590
rods you can greatly reduce the the

constraints on your on on the nature of

385
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:43,459
a safe topology um so you don't have to

386
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,710
introduce new full mesh requirements for

387
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,720
instance two years in bed ASB RS and you

388
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:53,360
can relax current constraints and I GP

389
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:56,720
metrics so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest benefit to this</font>

390
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:59,959
approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it fixes the problem it</font>

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't just make it appear less often I</font>

392
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,040
think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot to be said for</font>

393
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:09,170
fixing the problem as opposed to

394
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:13,220
papering it over and one important sub

395
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:15,590
part of this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that any</font>

396
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,300
complete solution to the BGP oscillation

397
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:21,560
problem is going to require the ability

398
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:24,070
to advertise multiple paths in BGP in it

399
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:29,720
was to relax the implicit withdrawal

400
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:32,419
behavior of current bgp so to that

401
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,190
extent that motivates wanting to get the

402
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:37,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure obese the multipath</font>

403
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:40,880
piece into bgp regardless of whether you

404
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:42,679
agree that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the algorithm be</font>

405

presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> for selecting exactly which</font>

406
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:48,110
was to advertise is the right one or not

407
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,980
finally the multipath extension has

408
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:53,899
other potential applications for example

409
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:56,750
multipath bgp that's not a hack and you

416
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:12,470
you have a way of directly expressing

00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,480
what your multipath right is another

435
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:05,330
reflection<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the rule that says</font>

436
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:10,540
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> only have to advertise the extra</font>

437
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:13,510
route if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> m.ed comes into play and</font>

438
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:16,280
probably to my mind that the biggest to

439
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,990
concerns our implementation complexity

440
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,550
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some fairly</font>

441
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:24,830
fundamental changes to how we generate

442
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:27,980
updates and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a fair amount</font>

443
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:29,870
of code work and then questions of how

444
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,420
you deploy in transition to this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

445
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:35,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that these problems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can be can be</font>

446
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:39,440
fixed but it's if not as transparently

447
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:42,140
primitive deployable and there are some

448
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,240
open questions one of which came up

449
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,970
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> yesterday so I thought I'd</font>

450
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in which is well doesn't this</font>

451
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:51,440
converge slower because you're

452
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:52,730
advertising more routes well you're from

453
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,410
transmitting more data when you

454
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,480
advertise all these multipath routes so

455
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:58,059
that's slower right well but you've got

456
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,100
all these new backup paths available

457
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:03,379
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to transmit after a</font>

458
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">routes withdrawn so actually convergence</font>

459
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,920
will be faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm guessing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

460
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,209
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> faster your network will</font>

461
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,190
actually converge faster because you've

462
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,620
got more backup or as available but I

463
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:16,110
can't prove<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right now</font>

464
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:19,419
um and here's the references there's a

465
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:22,750
RFC that talks about the oscillation

466
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:26,110
condition and there's two drafts the

467
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:27,340
first is<font color="#CCCCCC"> so actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I should have the</font>

468
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,379
second and third in the opposite order

469
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:31,000
the advertisement of multiple paths

470
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,100
talks about the infrastructural<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece</font>

471
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,790
how do you advertise multiple routes at

472
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:40,419
all and then our proposal for exactly

473
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:42,670
which routes you should advertise and

474
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:45,790
we'll be bringing this up at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next of</font>

477
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,540
interested thank you

you

479
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:16,190
so yeah now we have this this problem so

480
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:18,980
what do we happy we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our solution to</font>

481
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">it what should we do in the meantime so</font>

482
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,870
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me talk about really about this</font>

483
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,720
rather oscillation detection and also

484
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:30,260
some deployments and consideration and

485
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:34,220
backgrounds first is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rod oscillation</font>

486
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:36,950
detection and it has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> pointed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out it</font>

487
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:39,110
has been pointed out by multiple parties

488
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,360
watches a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> position rather</font>

489
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:45,740
oscillation occurs all it is a very

490
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:49,279
small<font color="#CCCCCC"> percentage of of the rod and</font>

491
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:53,240
inserting and network<font color="#E5E5E5"> topology however</font>

492
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:56,840
if for the affected our customer this is

493
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:59,500
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> huge problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because was just working</font>

494
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:05,299
activities the constant lon chaney and

495
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:08,330
so absolutely think that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

496
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:10,879
basically for actively work on this

497
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:13,428
issue that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect their curve</font>

498
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,669
once we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are detectives under the</font>

499
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,990

00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:21,409
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> days to work around the problem</font>

501
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:27,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">and really very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to fix them every</font>

502
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:30,230
configuration and so this works it is

503
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:32,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">noted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that fully automated approach is</font>

504
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:34,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">really where difficult to get it</font>

505
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:39,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">collects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so here we are suggesting</font>

506
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:42,500
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coefficient detection</font>

507
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:45,678
Marcus and I think the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

508
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:50,139
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a sad statistic for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

519
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:19,299
can basically you can look at the rods

522
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:29,769
investigate further I think if if if

523
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:32,799
them where the the windows keeping

00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:39,759

<font color="#E5E5E5">help a lot to the providers so here are</font>

some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the deployment considerations</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really you know if this is them it is</font>

529
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:57,279
amazing they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still some provide that</font>

534
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:13,090
part in a couple of implementations and

535
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:15,999
that these two inconsistent<font color="#CCCCCC"> I selection</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that people down your network sites you</font>

545
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:51,129

547
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:57,399
cannot handle it you should ask for it

548
00:27:53,649 --> 00:28:01,719
and I mean 500 plus<font color="#CCCCCC"> PA stations is</font>

549
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:03,100
really doable and regarding life you

00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,340
texting actually some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:33,060
happens OMG you know if the has been

00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:37,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">causing different types of different</font>

579
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,970
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a conscience to feeling</font>

580
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,490
basically if you do need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it I</font>

always<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it another way you use it</font>

only when needed at all another point is

583
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:54,720
that when you designing the rival

584
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:56,700
sectional Confederation topologies make

585
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:02,100
sure that you carefully evaluate the

00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:05,130
your network topology a one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font>

of the biggest factor right now is

588
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:13,170
probably regarding the the matrix

589
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:16,680
assignment for this is a inter-cluster

590
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:19,380

it is not always possible by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> f is</font>

neutral cluster the inter-cluster matrix

594
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,759
should be much larger than the

00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,728
intracluster

596
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:31,889
matric thing and if you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

597
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:35,719
basically you have a lot more

flexibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> in choosing which water I</font>

00:30:38,459 --> 00:30:44,999
probably pretty much<font color="#CCCCCC"> maggoty you could</font>

601
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:48,599
not issue mmm otherwise you know this

602
00:30:44,999 --> 00:30:54,269
matrix we play we're seeking significant

603
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:57,809
role in that this year and another

604
00:30:54,269 --> 00:31:00,059
bullet is that this actually has come up

605
00:30:57,809 --> 00:31:03,539
a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times on this LG our mailing</font>

606
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:07,489
list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here what I am suggesting is</font>

607
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:12,199
that and do not reducing the base pass

608
00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:15,569
from yd TD pass to another uppp path is

609
00:31:12,199 --> 00:31:17,549
simply based on that idea what id people

610
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:20,219
that that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just a random number</font>

611
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:23,099
and assuming everything being eco

612
00:31:20,219 --> 00:31:26,429
actually this is that even this is and

613
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:28,529
this DJ's on for some of its on by

614

00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:35,279
it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> ensure that and this feature that</font>

00:31:32,339 --> 00:31:39,569
in English rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the some rod</font>

617

633
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:36,000
ask us questions if not how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

634
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:38,850
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see an informal um how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

people restricting their topology due to

this how many isps are<font color="#E5E5E5"> restricting</font>

00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,340
have multiple levels<font color="#E5E5E5"> of route reflectors</font>

641
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:59,570
or you don't want to have multiple

levels of as considerations<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kashi one I</font>

643
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:05,669
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the unfair question because</font>

644
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:07,320
depending on how big your network is or

645
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:09,420
how your business imperatives make your

646
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,060
network design look like you can

647
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:14,940
restrict your topology because you can

648
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:17,610
maintain that much that that main number

649
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:20,520
sessions at the top level actually so

650
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:22,229
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's a good suggestion but it's</font>

651
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,670
not necessarily applicable to all people

652
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:25,620
and we should try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve this problem</font>

653
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,870
for all people regardless of<font color="#E5E5E5"> size</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

654
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:30,570
that's good input we are we are just I'm

655
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:33,270
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you we are just looking for some</font>

656
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,860
input because that we ran into questions

657
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,750
of what problem we're trying to solve so

658
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:39,360
I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to poke in anybody get a</font>

659
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:41,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">shame for display I am wishing for</font>

660
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,250
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> two different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comments maybe you</font>

661
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:47,220
can respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all I'd you know</font>

662
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:50,400
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Med attribute is the one attribute</font>

663
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:53,070
that breaks the rule<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says you know</font>

664
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">what the ranking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a path we should not</font>

665
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:57,330
depend on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the existence or non-existence</font>

666
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,760
of other routes in the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

667
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:02,639
right and so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes met an odd</font>

668
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,580
attribute and I would claim that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

669
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,700
real problem there is that people cannot

670
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:10,710
understand what they're writing when

671
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:15,080
they write down their policies because

672
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:15,080
it has that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of combinatorial</font>

673
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,469
semantics<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you only can't understand</font>

674
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:24,520
what you're writing in fact you can come

675
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:28,009
up with simple examples with full mesh<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

676
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:30,319
Benjamin I believe me I did you pee that

677
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:32,690
has non deterministic routing when<font color="#E5E5E5"> meds</font>

678
00:34:30,319 --> 00:34:35,599
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved look I can show you that</font>

679
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:37,909
example afterwards but the point is that

680
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:43,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">the real problem here is that we've got</font>

681
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:47,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">a broken attribute right now it has very</font>

682
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:50,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">good semantics the other thing is that</font>

683
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:54,559
you seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to imply that these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> non de nan</font>

684
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:58,189
termination problems with<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP have</font>

685
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:59,690
something to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> med or something to</font>

686
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,130
do with the route reflectors or

687
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,890
something to do with their interaction

688
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,839
when in fact it doesn't it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets booked</font>

689
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:09,740
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the melting point protocol you can</font>

690
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:12,140
get non terminating power fuse the 30

691
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,509
the first example that we case was

692
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:17,480
without meds nobody has route reflectors

693
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:22,220
material so it you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just with</font>

694
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:24,079
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a esas get a nonterminating set of</font>

695
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,839
policies and so it's built into the

696
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,420
protocol and you're seeing it with meds

697
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:32,480
why because people can't understand the

698
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:35,930
penalties they write those things down

699
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,750
they cannot understand what the policies

700
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:41,169
are doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this the fact that</font>

701
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:45,829
it's violating the fundamental rule of

702
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:48,680
ranking just the route not ranking

703
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:54,349
depending on what's in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

704
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:57,160
good just a wall jungle the<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn on if</font>

705
00:35:54,349 --> 00:35:57,160
not you got mine

706
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:05,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so just to respond to the metas are</font>

707
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:07,750
really weird attribute and it's very

708
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:12,559
hard to understand what it's doing I

709
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:15,859
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more and for a long time</font>

710
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:17,720
I was arguing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in favor of saying let's</font>

711
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:22,190
please just get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of this odd duck</font>

712
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:25,009
because it's a mess<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people in</font>

713
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:27,849
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> room responded rather forcefully</font>

714
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:31,520
that that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely unacceptable um</font>

715
00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:34,039
if the if the opinion of the operator

716
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,780
community has changed since then and

717
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:38,450
everyone is happy to just stop using

718
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:40,400

00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:43,759
would say that that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> just fine</font>

720
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,950
with me and being your router probably

721
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,109
already supports it you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just turn on</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> always compare med knob and you're</font>

723
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:54,558
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but a year from now two years</font>

724
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,710
from now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be here again</font>

725
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:59,299
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know people are going</font>

726
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:02,150
to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> our starting to name is very</font>

00:36:59,299 --> 00:37:04,490
complex Community attributes to new

728
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:06,339
traffic engineering between autonomous

729
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:09,410
systems it's just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start causing</font>

730
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:11,839
oscillation eventually when especially

731
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:13,399
when it's crossing autonomous systems

732
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,650
that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the same administrative</font>

733
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,559
domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're in the same company where</font>

734
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:22,279
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not constrained by the pier pure</font>

735
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:23,630
customer provider relationships so the

736
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:25,819
fact is that there's a fundamental

737
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:28,700
problem built into the protocol there's

738
00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:30,829
no guarantee of convergence you just

739
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:33,259
bumped<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it with meds you're going to</font>

740
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:36,109
bump into it again so it's a

741
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:38,569
disrespected discussion right yes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

742
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:40,160
unless exactly what's happening here it

743
00:37:38,569 --> 00:37:44,450
just happens because people can't

744
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,308
understand their policies that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

745
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:53,930
opinion

746
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:55,099
and you're entitled to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I I guess</font>

747
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,448
actually I do you want to respond just

748
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:58,729
briefly to the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of your</font>

749
00:37:56,449 --> 00:38:02,420
comment which I if I'm paraphrasing it

750
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:05,058
correctly is that bgp is a distance

751
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,979
vector protocol and it has a you know uh

752
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:11,289
non convergence problem in other cases

753
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:13,819
other than m.ed the point is well taken

754
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:20,719
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do you think it's the case</font>

755
00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:22,640
that for you know that the meed

756
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:24,380
convergence thing is a significantly

757
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,989
greater problem than some of these other

758
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,789
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the univers have shown their</font>

759
00:38:26,989 --> 00:38:30,680
interesting cases i'm going to be really

760
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:39,349
nice if the protocol provably converge

761
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:40,969
in all cases to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> first yeah and one</font>

762
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:43,119
thing to it again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure yeah I'm</font>

763
00:38:40,969 --> 00:38:46,519
wondering too is talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I</font>

764
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,099
remember you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a cordial cody gets out</font>

765
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:51,258
have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of papers on that talking</font>

766
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:53,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">about problems of global policy versus</font>

local products involving multiple years

768
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:58,249
is that they are sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be as</font>

769
00:38:55,789 --> 00:39:02,029
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> devise some precision laser</font>

770
00:38:58,249 --> 00:39:05,238
oscillation hmm yeah some some of this

771
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:08,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">is totally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said about interesting but we</font>

772
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:13,009
are actually i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the probability of</font>

773
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:16,640
them occurring and in practice if it's

774
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:18,890
less aged more and then this a bgp

775
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,900
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> p to choose without provide a</font>

different policies being applied there

777
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,759
are 36 boundary well that may be true

778
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:29,299
now but will it be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in three years when</font>

779
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:35,170
people are doing very complex policies

780
00:39:29,299 --> 00:39:40,579
with using communities<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know i</font>

781
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:44,869
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone does well yeah I do</font>

782
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:48,999
but I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling a while back here</font>

783
00:39:44,869 --> 00:39:52,789
you conceited any other questions

comments and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can poke</font>

785
00:39:52,789 --> 00:40:00,199
out of comments we we welcome comments

786
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:04,309
about this Alex I think that summarizes

787
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:09,079
my attempt to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more input for you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

793
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:23,239
we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find what you want to do</font>

794
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:25,400
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so I I just strongly encourage</font>

795
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:27,380
people to speak up because we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been at</font>

796
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,619
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve this problem for I think</font>

797
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:32,719
four or five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we have we have</font>

798
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:34,719
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that shows that about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent</font>

799
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:38,029
of the internet it currently deployed

800
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:41,569
subjected to this problem and we have a

801
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:43,880
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fixes we can not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turn on meds</font>

802
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:46,369
or you can not pay attention ahmed's you

803
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:49,849
can restrict your topology we can put in

804
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:51,469
a change to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocol which will be</font>

805
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:53,689
internal only change the algorithm a sec

806
00:40:51,469 --> 00:40:55,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">are presented we can have more</font>

807
00:40:53,689 --> 00:40:56,390
significant changes that will solve this

808
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:58,489
problem in other problems into the

809
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:00,650
future but we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some deployment</font>

810
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:03,349
considerations or we can continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

811
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:05,059
nothing right now one thing that Lincoln

812
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:06,140
do is what we've done to the last five

813
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:07,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">years which is continue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do nothing</font>

814
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:11,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">because there's no consensus whatsoever</font>

815
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:14,118
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I highly recommend that we come to</font>

816
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:16,400
resolution what we want done if there's

817
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:20,809
enough pain tell us so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can fix it if</font>

818
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,009
not we'll keep doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing this is not</font>

819
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:23,539
also an offer to stop giving

820
00:41:22,009 --> 00:41:28,759
presentations about this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone's</font>

821
00:41:23,539 --> 00:41:30,890
sick of it yeah we'll stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking I'd</font>

822
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:32,929
say two points um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

823
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:38,529
problems and i'm sure most of us would

824
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:41,299
agree is it's encouraged or at least

825
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:42,619
it's been based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the literature</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

826
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:44,959
us a little show this probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> one book</font>

827
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:47,119
that everybody here that's on a second

828
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:49,669
revision would agree is something a lot

829
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,750
of the small corporations companies are

830
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,920
appearing or

831
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:53,420
purchasing trends that are using to

832
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,210
build their configurations and that is

833
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:59,270
to use med as a way to influence in

834
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:01,550
bound traffic and doing it in any other

835
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:03,410
way involves communities and matching

836
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:05,750
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> values so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shun</font>

837
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:07,040
provider can set local preference and

838
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,050
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something that's very well</font>

839
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,060
socialized so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still going to see</font>

840
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:14,120
this explosive use of the broken

841
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:17,090
attribute and on I think the second

842
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:20,120
point would be that a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our ESPYs</font>

843
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:23,390
are still using or translating<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

844
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,830
distance into meds and then announcing

845
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:26,569
that I think in the previous

846
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,400
presentation when we saw those s path

847
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:30,680
updates I think that's likely what the

848
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,510
cause was because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Red or I'm sorry</font>

849
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">ninda was was breaking a lot of internal</font>

850
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:38,030
links for breaking ethernet lands or

851
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:39,830
whatever which was causing some topology

852
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:42,740
changes in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP which was then</font>

853
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:44,060
reflecting itself in the meds that were

854
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,310
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> reflected I urge being announced</font>

855
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,360
outside the network so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think why we're</font>

856
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">still doing that we're going to continue</font>

857
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,990
to see these type of oscillatory

858
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:52,190
problems with med alone and then to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

859
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:54,770
previous point we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see with</font>

860
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:56,780
other folks as well as we keep kind of

00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:09,370
while I'm sorry yeah yeah let me comment

864
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:12,110
on that I absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree with you and</font>

865
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:15,350
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion is regarding the use of</font>

866
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:18,080
energy and I think the energy has been

<font color="#E5E5E5">used for cutting deployed to being</font>

00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:26,930
more than eight years<font color="#CCCCCC"> now other other</font>

872
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:35,089
Ichabod is obviously poet vary so widely

873
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:39,020
I mean gesture you cannot<font color="#CCCCCC"> change it and</font>

00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:41,480
and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the one of the slides one of</font>

00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:44,870
the slides one of the soot slide shows

876
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:46,730
that in this the right oscillation

886
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:15,740
and more in line with John's points and

887
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think both your points that we can</font>

we're we're sharing among bgp speakers

890
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,960
to get rid of this loss of information

891

prom especially with this kind of

stratified decision process that can

893
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,540
change based on where you are in the

894
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:31,879
network so if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a med problem</font>

895
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:33,470
that's fine it but it could be other

896
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,480
problems down room and I think it's

897
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,649
those maybe we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start analyzing</font>

898
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:44,240
what those potential failure modes can

be beforehand Alex Alex in and I'm going

920
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:38,868
that's when I definitely until you

921

actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> will detach and provide the</font>

feedback to that you can port in goods

nothing's going to happen that's nothing

924
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:48,589
that will satisfy you guys does it

925
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:50,390
solution yeah I step 1 comment I think

926
00:45:48,589 --> 00:45:51,859
that clearly solving the convergence

927
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:53,990
problem is desirable I would say even

928
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:55,400
going one step further and knowing that

929
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">not only will the protocol converge but</font>

930
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,460
knowing that it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> converge to a</font>

931
00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:01,730
particular solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can be</font>

932
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:03,500
predicted from the input but I'm what i

933
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:05,839
mean by that just a pic of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> small</font>

934
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">example is this notion of disabling use</font>

935
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,099
a router ID the one of the suggestions

936
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:12,440
that came up in the last presentation if

937
00:46:10,099 --> 00:46:12,950
you take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new route that's better</font>

938
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,020
only

939
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:16,310
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> ID not switching to it when</font>

940
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,530
disadvantage of that is it becomes

941
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:19,880
difficult from a static snapshot of the

942
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:21,829
wrasslin from neighboring domains to

943

944

the system will have and this makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

prediction tools for traffic engineering

947
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:30,920
that depend on being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to know what</font>

950
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:36,440
making things dependent on order and

951
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:41,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">timing seems very risky if you want a</font>

00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:45,530
predictable system yeah that's who

953
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:50,119
however I like to point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you</font>

the problem is occurring and that's what

1006
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:56,550
anchor referred to in his talk also<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1007
00:48:55,109 --> 00:49:00,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">good I think it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what that up to free</font>

1008
00:48:56,550 --> 00:49:02,880
behind the most important is basically

1009
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:05,190
to keep a history of uh oh bitch if it

1010
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,130
changes within the law yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

1011
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:10,260
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does we're going to let you look at</font>

1012
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:13,470
pretty much every 10 vendor has

00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:17,510
implemented radicals laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on</font>

enemy adapted to make a statistic for

1017
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:29,550
GDP and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a couple days work</font>

1018
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:32,880
that's all ok so we're eager<font color="#CCCCCC"> to leave</font>

1019
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:36,390
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right why don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do it in a low</font>

1020
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,160
this allows some engineers to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with</font>

1021
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:40,680
it and sing this item somewhat sketchy

1022
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,629
meeting if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> working well not so</font>

1023
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:47,250
probably kinda we don't announce table

1024
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:49,170
at your account<font color="#E5E5E5"> team now EK</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and just</font>

1025
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:52,680
to reinforce what general saying earlier

1026
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:56,190
a non-deterministic bad selection based

1027
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:58,740
on order of which you received the route

1028
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:01,500
is not acceptable we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had that</font>

1029
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:03,810
turned on for us by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco we were trying</font>

1030
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,700
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and get a better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution</font>

1031
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:07,740
the first thing we did after<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of</font>

1032
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:09,598
router reboots totally change the

1033
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:14,848
traffic patterns was to turn the stupid

1034
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:17,339
knob off so that's at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> arras that's</font>

1035
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:19,660
not a viable movie Jack I respond to

1036
00:50:17,339 --> 00:50:22,150
that at that time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was ours</font>

1038
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:32,770
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> fixed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay can you boys take</font>

1039
00:50:28,539 --> 00:50:35,410
that one outside from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the infidels in</font>

1040
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:38,890
provo 21 you know one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about John</font>

1041
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:42,220
and the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> part is it's not that</font>

1042
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:44,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISPs don't really know what we are</font>

1043
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:47,919
discussing here it's like most people

1044
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:51,038
don't care so if you can fix this

1045
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,510
problem by sending more bgp information

1046
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:58,329
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> RC and ABNA Marines it gets from any</font>

1047
00:50:54,510 --> 00:51:00,730
megabytes to say 100 megabytes most

1048
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:04,000
people will not care just go ahead and

1049
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:06,700
fix the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just put it in I mean</font>

1050
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,500
we've already like that enough stuff to

1051
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:15,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">off that this will be a minor change and</font>

1052
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:17,140
then divest really is fielder we're

1053
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,150
sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> here waiting for is used to come</font>

1054
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,650
to you to tell us tell you what the

1055
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:22,660
wrong and the thing is most people don't

1056
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:26,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is at the wrong and B we</font>

1057
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:27,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe they are in the</font>

1058
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:30,490
ESPYs will understand with reporting

1059
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:33,190
about here<font color="#E5E5E5"> an entire internet and out of</font>

1060
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:34,779
those like maybe three are here so I CSU

1061
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:39,279
just fix the problem and not tell

1062
00:51:34,779 --> 00:51:41,559
anybody wanna thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually a couple</font>

1063
00:51:39,279 --> 00:51:43,420
tissue a cup of solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but i</font>

1064
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:45,309
think if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you fix it one way or the other</font>

1065
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:48,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the regarding the memory utilization</font>

1066
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:50,170
is how much increase it<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be really</font>

1067
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,160
cheap resolve whether you are using

1068
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:56,680
closest exit or not today if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1069
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">will probably be not increase much but</font>

1070
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:02,078
it isn't too much<font color="#E5E5E5"> once you take this one</font>

1071
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:04,289
it can double triple you the memory

1072
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,289
utilization

1073
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:11,530
I don't know why you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

1074
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:17,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">rock slab dampening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wrap flat dampening</font>

1075
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:18,250
just makes persistent isolation and you

1076
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,380
know what it doesn't give in to the

1077
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:22,060
isolation it makes it harder to<font color="#CCCCCC"> debug I</font>

1078
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:24,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you're missing acres point which</font>

1079
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:27,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the machinery that you use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a flat</font>

1080
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:30,940
dampening can also be used in basically

1081
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">a listen-only mode to identify flapping</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">about it by hand Justin if statistics</font>

1085
00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:45,280
does the operator tell that this is due

1086
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:47,560
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ned and not something else that's how</font>

1087
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,780
they run their absorbance hours and

1088
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:52,810
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we spend so much money on</font>

1089
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:58,030
things like that isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I mean this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1090
00:52:52,810 --> 00:53:01,359
a very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to do but I think</font>

1091
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:04,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first for step right at least</font>

1092
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:06,880
you have some to to deal with it but

1093
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:08,980
your point is taken again but I think we

1094
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:12,520
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know crawl before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we walk</font>

1095
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:15,550
before you run I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think most varieties</font>

1096
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:18,339
already know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem the</font>

1097
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:19,930
problem is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our customers don't</font>

1098
00:53:18,339 --> 00:53:23,828
understand why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't carry the</font>

1099
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:28,000
traffic the closest peers let's say from

1100
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:31,060
dca to sunnyvale or something most of

1101
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,869
our customers get very upset when we

1102
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:37,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand off the traffic at the closest exit</font>

1103
00:53:33,869 --> 00:53:40,630
instead of us carrying the traffic as

1104
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:45,270
much as possible so it's more of a

1105
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:49,150
business reason than a technical reason

1106
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:51,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thank you Jeff and then that's the</font>

1107
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:53,440
last question Susan tells me were out of

1108

time thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the import all not</font>

1109
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:59,050
even those questions is this sort of

1110
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:02,560
suggestion they sent earlier comment we

1111
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:05,390
were implementing bgp probably should

1112
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:08,270
provide to our users

1113
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:09,680
output the chosen reduce your IP bgp or

1114
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:11,509
whatever that shows where the

1115
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,859
tiebreaking is happening so people who

1116

are trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like traffic</font>

tiebreaking that router ID differently

1119

<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a very good come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>
