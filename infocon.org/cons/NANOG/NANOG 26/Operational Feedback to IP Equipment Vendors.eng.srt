to the vendors on what we like to see

and there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some things that I will</font>

our infrastructure and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely</font>

48
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,670
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look into that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because currently</font>

50
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,679
completely wonderful and I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that like submerging</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vgb or supporting</font>

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,950

53
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:34,230
about knocking the routers offline so

54
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:37,380
here are some slides these are from last

55
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,609
month from AOL knock which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a in the</font>

56
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,340
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> knock and you will see the</font>

57
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,280
biggest number of large number of

58
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,070
tickets are routers and switches as

59
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,230
compared to the hardware side and there

60
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:54,870
are a lot more hardware and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host</font>

61
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:56,910
side then there are writers in al so

62
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,690
here's a normalized view of our incident

63
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:03,750
ratio and you will see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the worst</font>

64
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,459
router vendor is at thirty-five percent

65
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty five percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

66
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:11,459
install base has issues that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

67
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,679
touch every month and the best one is

68
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:18,690
around eight percent this is compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

69
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,540
the hosts which we have a lot more off

70
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,239
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> holds the worst host that we have</font>

71
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,160
the worst vendor for host sorry at AOL

72
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,810
it

73
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:33,049
around 1.4 one percent now incident

74
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">ratio so this year is a bit of a walk we</font>

75
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,250
have about an order of magnitude to go

76
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:39,410
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our improving or routers before they</font>

77
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,570
can match the stability for hosts and a

78
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,430
horse sound very stable at least

79
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:46,579
according to most of the system admin I

80
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,900
got to on a daily basis so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

81
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:51,680
what the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

82
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,900
squeeze costs so far and bandwidth and

83
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:59,090
hardware costs are more elastic because

84
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:02,900
they oh I hate to use the word optronics

85
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:05,180
but i will use the optronic subtract

86
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">seem to go and we bought double in</font>

87
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,340
capacity every two years for the hot

88
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:13,190
price but the heel cost unfortunately

89
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,900
does not so what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is we</font>

90
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,070
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce the incident ratio of our</font>

91
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:22,760
routers because every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we touch the</font>

92
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:27,380
writers it costs us money so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

93
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:30,800
the top router issues um as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font>

94
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,680
Chris<font color="#CCCCCC"> backs and cod bladers account for</font>

95
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:40,160
a significant chunk of our incident

96
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:42,669
ratio here<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is a normalized view of</font>

97
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,669
the same data

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,040
we can pressure that one to floor are

99
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:53,230
not good it means one out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> every four</font>

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,350
devices every month has has to be

101
00:04:53,230 --> 00:05:00,070
touched that's money going down the

102
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:02,470
drain hmm so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the resolutions we</font>

103
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,719
see the card blades down and if

104
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,150
obviously replace equipment in almost

105
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,950
every case this replacing equipment

106
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,620
means we have to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> out hands and eyes</font>

107
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:16,500
remove hands each remote hand incident

108
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:19,660
costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> money here's the ticket versus</font>

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:28,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendors are good 128 some vendors are</font>

111
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:31,930
bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 2 3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here is our assignment but if</font>

112
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,639
all the tickets opened last month 220 of

113
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:37,330
them went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to internet engineering which</font>

114
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:39,340
is the group I oh man and so every

115
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">ticket that goes to the group costs us</font>

116
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:45,669
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here's the major cost per bit</font>

117
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,260
components of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> network the SG&A is of</font>

118
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:48,580
course normalized for obvious reasons

119
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,620
and we are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give you the</font>

120
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,050
exact numbers here but here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the trend</font>

121
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,520
notice the trend only goes to 2012's the

122
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,190
last year we have data for we haven't

123
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,130
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> the financials for this year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>

124
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:03,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">can see the cost of the oven stm-1 is</font>

125
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,900
normalized st1 go down on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

126
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,300
steep curve and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think at this point we</font>

127
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,890
are probably below what the cost to

128
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:14,610
manufacture is however<font color="#E5E5E5"> our SG&A seems to</font>

129
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:14,610
not go down much at all

130
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,890
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this means is this gap</font>

131
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:25,660
here between SG&A this is the gap we

132
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:28,229
need to squeeze if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want stay in</font>

133
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:31,120
business this gap right here and

134
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,190
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> till our vendors make</font>

135
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,850
better hardware and have more bus

136
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,680
software we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not going to get there</font>

137
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:41,410
we used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this luxury of spending</font>

138
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:45,160
of selling the dollar bill for seventy

139
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:48,570
cents no longer that is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does</font>

140
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:52,260
not work as we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered</font>

141
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:54,880
unfortunately to our detriment that

142
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,099
losing money on every sale and making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

143
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,730
up in volume is a joke not a business

00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,390
was the cost component what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,610
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you that we do track our costs</font>

147
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,320
we know where the problems are we know

148
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,690
where the vendors with problems are and

149
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,330
we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps to to migrate away from</font>

150
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,940
those vendors because they cost us money

151
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:21,940
so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that having said let's talk to</font>

this is sprint had a very good paper on

Meyer if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to normal about it but</font>

184
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,050
the problem that we've seen is the micro

185
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:51,209
bursts happen if your access speed is on

186
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,099
the same level as your background speed

187
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:54,569
and I don't know what most people<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,189
the chances of having microbursts which

you often drop users dropped and<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop</font>

202
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:28,219
since when I was a junior at in 1998 and

203
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,220
we haven't seen anything happens instead

204
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:36,450
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not enough the fob</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we build</font>

like you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Philippi the left the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bill</font>

207
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,339
so the people that are left to build

208
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:49,529
would like to have working counters

209

before we go away to thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

there any questions interrupt me

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:10,560
so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad old days at a large now</font>

218
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:23,940
with so basically the thought is if it

219
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't have well the resolution for</font>

that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PNP he was if it happens again</font>

run<font color="#E5E5E5"> a business so basically the</font>

223
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,730
statement the standard we have play

224
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,310
again and that which you should take

225
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:40,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">also is that if the control plane does</font>

226
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:43,920
not have ECC which is error correcting

232
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:03,899
with dual processor boxes one is the

233
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:05,819
master processor and then give a slave

<font color="#CCCCCC">way hellos and what we've seen before in</font>

239
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,699
other thing previous large Bank of ISPs

240
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:22,740
is that sometimes what happens is when

241
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:25,829
you find diameter for<font color="#CCCCCC"> network exceeds</font>

242
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,079
your current on timers in or say I use

243
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:31,920
the word ospf because most family

244
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,739
networks are no SPF what happens is that

245
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,630
your primary CPU is sitting there

246
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:41,339
calculating the SPF<font color="#E5E5E5"> three in case of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

247
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,829
interface failure so you sit there read

248
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,510
out with your entire ospf database

249
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:47,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">Walker database and recalculate the new</font>

250

251
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,949
time diameter is so large now that your

252
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:56,189
CPU is really turning it cannot respond

253
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:58,229
to hellos so the slave sends a hello the

254
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:01,260
CPU is busy calculating nothing comes

255

says oh the primary is down i<font color="#E5E5E5"> will now</font>

257
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,949

essentially do a reset sending on

00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:20,699
another flood of LSA saying that this

is please for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the love of God for</font>

otherwise your hellos this is apparently

harder than you think because<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

go down so for the vendors that no no

that don't know this please father Zia

323
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:56,150

00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,310
a sprint link beer goes down and DS

325
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,410
happen all the time so now we have to

326
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:03,050
take that entire 30 40 thousand route

327
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,270
set in the fit and implement each

328

one it's not going to interface six so

331
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,410
we walk for each other prefixes and

332
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,350
update them individually one<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a time</font>

333
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:17,270
this takes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of several minutes that</font>

334
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,010
I define as bad convergence even though

00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:22,010
the web has converged in<font color="#E5E5E5"> indore birth</font>

336
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,930

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an indirect next stop so instead of</font>

342
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,210

347
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,320
automatically point to interface eight

348
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:49,819
again not rocket science but you will be

349
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,500
surprised how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people don't do this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and this cuts into our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> conversion styles</font>

another thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> general the protocols</font>

374

is unjust using an example it doesn't

375
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:07,030
matter as long as you have a

376

through one parallel interface the other

half goes to the stand the other

389

interface and now the router above that

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,190
which is aggregating all the traffic

391
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:48,730
gets all this deterministic already

are<font color="#CCCCCC"> sea 100m started splitting traffic</font>

water does<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exact same strict so now</font>

all the traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up the lower</font>

415
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,330
half of the hash now goes to this router

and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen the line starts to heat</font>

417
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:57,918
up here and then this router takes all

these aggregator<font color="#CCCCCC"> 190 tombs and then</font>

419
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:05,929
splits them all across this link oops so

420
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:07,668
what we're asking is randomly salt usual

421
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:10,159
a good source of entropy<font color="#CCCCCC"> due to</font>

an area or a coaster than to be rebooted

424
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:17,719
very quickly one after the other and if

425
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:21,019
you're basing your hash on<font color="#CCCCCC"> timers since</font>

426
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,330
reboot sometimes they will not do the

right thing so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a good</font>

488
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:02,350
because sometimes we apply these on our

core routers and a transit traffic we do

490

for taking traffic in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

502

processing the traffic that is traffic

00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:38,809
rather stand to process data

504
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,639
and move it around some interface to

505
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:43,370
interface as first digesting or

506
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,780
generating data routers are very poorly

507
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:47,090
of that and the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

508
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:50,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">no cost effective economical way to go</font>

509
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:53,270
the router that can take for example an

510
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:57,049
800cc 192<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight gigs most of traffic</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">unattended worth of traffic the drug</font>

512
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:01,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">processor sorry 80 gigs worth of traffic</font>

513
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,260
and if you can do that it will cost a

514
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,629
lot of money essentially you doubled

515
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,760
your router spread<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost because we move</font>

516
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:10,669
it at the same high school<font color="#E5E5E5"> fear links</font>

517
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,470
and lots of seating you to digest all

518
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:15,380
the traffic so what this means is that

519
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:17,000
no matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> how big your routers are all</font>

520

somebody needs to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with send enough</font>

522
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:30,559

523
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,360
this issue is that something again which

524
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,820
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be simple but most people do</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">not pay attention to and do not have and</font>

526
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,520
I ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you as is p is to push your</font>

533

step and nobody can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do it today</font>

534

packets come in they all go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

535
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,210
queue your web with RP and then right on

536
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,490
the wall processor to disintegrate good

537
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:09,679
from that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a force completely</font>

538
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,960
useless if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being hit with a back</font>

539
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:15,169
and foot you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> so busy disintegrating</font>

540
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,610
good from that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you going to die so</font>

541
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:18,110
this should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done on the line card</font>

542
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:19,580
because then you distributed your

543
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:24,439
processing load over multiple interfaces

544
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:26,210
as opposed to single to a point so this

545
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:31,130
seems off stacks targeted hardware

546
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:32,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're increasing and great limiting is</font>

547
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,030
not an answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you can always</font>

not going to SBS that any of your

customers hopefully so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

557
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:01,230
want a short-term dynamically filter oh

558
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,180
by the way md5 is not an answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

559
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:07,320
you can always send enough fake md5 that

560
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:08,760
the router will crash anyway and I

561
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,429
dealings that's where what I really want

562
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,620
is we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move the control plane out</font>

563
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:15,720
of band in them so to speak as a

<font color="#E5E5E5">lifelong ipsec or something tunnels and</font>

00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,100
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> run the control going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on top of</font>

566

that unfortunately to do any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

567
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:25,620
vendors have to implement priority

568

during open / graphic so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going one</font>

569
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,419
so this is essentially something that

update your filters dynamically whenever

572
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,540
you configure bgp beer so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at least</font>

573
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,540
attacks face is reduced

582
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,160
bad use the same entropy for that you

583
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,809
pull for your isn randomizers an

584
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,820
enormous rather than just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good isn</font>

585
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:14,340
randomizes use the same thing for the

00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:17,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">box and there's also another security</font>

587
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:21,250
issue basically that we put out this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

588
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:25,030
a bgp TDI security hack which basically

589
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:28,510
inverts your bgp algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

590
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:30,850
sending TTL one so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can talk to your</font>

591
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:35,500
diary connected neighbors we set the PDL

592
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:37,659
to 255 and then only<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to only care</font>

593
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:41,919
that I DGP of bgp packets that<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in</font>

594
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:46,660
with the TTL off say 250 for 255 at 153

595
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:49,299
and minus multi hopes of course and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

have<font color="#CCCCCC"> uncommon real time so you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

600
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:04,030
your IV DP source address is coming from

601
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,639
outside so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't filter I ddb</font>

00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:12,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">source addresses this this will help you</font>

603
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:18,240
at all and that's it sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the quickly but any questions any late</font>

605
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:24,970
oh hey buddy

606
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:30,658
usually the convergence glass you

607
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,929
referring to Anna benchmarking

608
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:36,210
specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> States it's not that it's</font>

609
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:39,150
only do it the convergence definition is

610
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:41,549
only for one part and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the whole</font>

611
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:43,980
part we should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them one of the</font>

612
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:46,559
authors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and check but</font>

613
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:49,200
the whole part is is the convergence on

614
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,789
the control plane plus getting it to the

615
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,530
forwarding plane but it was breaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

616
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:53,820
apart for benchmarking so that's the

617
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:56,549
draft you're referring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in your</font>

618
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:58,649
convergence documents it's trying to say

619
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:03,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">no we're not the whole park okay we're</font>

620
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,289
just talk thank you any other questions

621
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,490
all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font>
