00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,400

a project<font color="#E5E5E5"> at you dad called rocket fuel</font>

25
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,930
and the goal with rocket fuel is to take

<font color="#E5E5E5">all the public face trout servers that</font>

he could find and have them run a

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,810
carefully selected set of trace routes

29
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:26,039
through a handful of ISPs and use that

30
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:29,189
to try to construct as accurate maps as

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,310
we could of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten iced teas from no</font>

lot of graduate student time my time to

37
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,289
try to care care for and feed the

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,490
machine so that we could get so we could

39
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,280
get good measurements and deal with

40
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,339
issues of strange servers and things

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,479
like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem that we're</font>

42
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,070
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address is that doing this</font>

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,140
sort of distributed<font color="#E5E5E5"> network measurement</font>

44
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,279
is is hard there's two<font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces of it</font>

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,869
being hard one is the development

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,219
problem that is if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want a regular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

47
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,170
tool where you want to change trace out

48
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,939
in some way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to deal with both</font>

49
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,818
kind of some arcane interfaces like

50
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,469
calling setsockopt IP header and

51
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,659
to get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rocket to do what you want it</font>

52
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:13,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you need to have root and any</font>

53
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,328
place I've ever been if you want to have

54
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,560
root you have to administer your own

55
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:18,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine from scratch because nobody</font>

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,519
wants to touch that<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine and then</font>

57
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,409
once you finally get a tool that might

58
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,780
work you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> then try to distribute</font>

59
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:27,000
it and distributed around and that you

60
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,920
know or an order of magnitude harder

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,680
just by virtue of being instituted

62
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,629
system so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted to you know after</font>

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,400
going off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and building something</font>

64
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,108
that did all of this from<font color="#E5E5E5"> scratch we</font>

65
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,329
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build an infrastructure that</font>

would make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easy to do again taking</font>

67
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:42,629
all of the lessons early hon so we built

script out which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an environment for</font>

69

distributed lightweight active networks

70
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:48,929
measurements I would try to add more

00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,388
keywords<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but I would run out of</font>

72

00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:55,260
of these tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're using measurements</font>

excavating pearl thing that would be

76
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:04,129
disgusting but expressing just the logic

77
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,120
of the measurement in a script and using

78
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:07,858
amount of infrastructure there to

79

82
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:17,489

right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now just to give you a sense of</font>

89
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,750
the context a little bit more if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had</font>

98
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:52,319
being able to run so many hosts means

99
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:54,150
that if we r you know researchers we

100
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,768
could get comprehensive energy points

101

not just what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet looks like</font>

102
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:00,090
from research universities or if we're

103
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,400
trying to debug the network we could get

everybody running them everywhere

114
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,990
let me be how close can we get trying to

115
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,400
put some other stuff into context you

116
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,960
could think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about doing something with a</font>

117
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,859
dedicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> touch bed like ninny or ripe</font>

118
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,630
ncc or auntie or surveyor or you know

119
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,370
they're a bunch of these these would

120
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,719
that you run any measurement you you

121
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,450
could come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with and condense people</font>

122
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,830
to deploy but the deployment is kind of

123
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,920
limited by having to use dedicated

124
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,599
machines and either uniform hardware or

125
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:50,190
software a miniature special hardware

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,480
for time stamping so although these you

127
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,690
know the hardware sometimes navigating

128
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:57,570
cheaper and hardware is cheap and power

129
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,890
is cheap these are somewhat inherently

130
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,130
limited deployment you can just install

131
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,260
stuff on your own workstation another

132
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,060
extreme at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end where you could</font>

133
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,860
run stuff anywhere and but but a very

134
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,150
limited set of measurements would be

135
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,430
used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the public place about service</font>

136
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,349
like we did in rocket fuel these are

137
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,480
great right there they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> everywhere</font>

138
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,860
anybody can can put up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a server joseph</font>

139
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,330
has been comfortable server and<font color="#CCCCCC"> saucers</font>

140
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,490
has been can clearly anybody else's

141
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:26,010
server and when we used almost 300

142
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,380
servers for presenting you know almost a

143
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,610
thousands routers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vantage collect</font>

144
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,240
stuff the internet when we did our our

145
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:35,120
study but you can't do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

146
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,340
you can only do trace route and pick up

147
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,690
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sucks for doing the sort of</font>

148
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,849
stuff that you might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

149
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,500
right take three<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets for hop that's</font>

150
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">not necessary all the time it does</font>

151
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,630
reverse name lookups who really cares

152
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:50,130
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that at the client anyway</font>

153
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:52,469
so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide something that's a</font>

154
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,450
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more flexible so script out</font>

155
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,300
is designed to support measurements that

156
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,430
use a few packets few bites they're

157
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,690
lightweight that is they send safe

158
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,580
packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can send anything you want</font>

159
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,950
but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make up a rule</font>

160
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,200
set that defines what things we don't

161
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,550
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send so for example like IP</font>

162
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,280
broadcast packet so you wouldn't want

163
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,770
people watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> Smurfs style stuff from</font>

164
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,400
here or soothing a source address

165
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,870
whatever and they use the resources that

166
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,729
is I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there really any tools</font>

167
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,890
out there that do something very

168
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,390
complicated with with the responses that

169
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">they get back but</font>

170
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,539
there it is anyway and you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font>

171
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do this on sort of shared ordinary</font>

172
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:34,510
servers any any<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could find</font>

173
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:36,850
and the instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using a uniform</font>

174
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:39,099
hardware image or uniforms complete

175
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:40,660
software installation we're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

176
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,250
interpreter that's interpreting these

177
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">scripts as an environment that if you</font>

178
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,310
can expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interpreter at to be</font>

179
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:49,990
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and support roughly the same</font>

180
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:52,390
features and so the goal then is to

181
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,190
really just combine either the best or

182
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,820
the worst attributes of both<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems and</font>

183
00:06:54,190 --> 00:07:01,570
and get something that's also useful so

184
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,849
we've built a handful<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools both both</font>

185
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:06,159
local tools and distributed tools and we

186
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,200
have a handful of badge students in our

187
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,250
networks class working on some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

188
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,570
things so it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> really fun just to</font>

189
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,800
review some of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

190
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,110
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> built we've reimplemented a</font>

191
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,070
handful of things both<font color="#CCCCCC"> tracy aren t</font>

192
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,350
should be traced out and it takes very

193
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">little code and i'll show you both of</font>

194
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">those just briefly in later slides you</font>

195
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:29,080
can start staring at them now is here if

196
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:30,610
you love code we have like three

197
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,550
implementations of paying disqus<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's of</font>

198
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,200
easy and fun an implementation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ali</font>

199
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,080
which is a tool that we wrote in the

200
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,060
rocket fuel project<font color="#E5E5E5"> that designs to take</font>

201
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,270
all of the interface IP addresses that

202
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,790
come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> trace out and collapse them so</font>

203
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,200
that you find routers that is when you

204
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:48,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">see when you take a traceroute you're</font>

205
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,170
actually seeing the list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> English</font>

206
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:54,430
interfaces on these<font color="#CCCCCC"> gutters and you'd</font>

207
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:56,980
really rather make a map or oh yeah as

208
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:00,460
we make a map or a graph of routers not

209
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:03,610
innervation stuff not very helpful<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

210
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:08,200
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also implemented a tool called escrow</font>

211
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:09,730
financial water here<font color="#CCCCCC"> as probe is this</font>

212
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,550
tool for packet pair of bandwidth

213
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:16,960
estimation that was developed

214
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:19,420
oh there's the yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so s probe is</font>

215
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,700
this tool that is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like net timer</font>

216
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:24,580
if you know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for a packet pair</font>

217
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,719
bandwidth estimation just another thing

218
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,870
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could throw in that was like</font>

219
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,150
wait and fun so although it was really

220
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:34,210
easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement interesting tools kind</font>

221
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,980
of point it's also really easy to come

222
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:39,130
to compulsory schools into something

223
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:41,409
that's distributed either for and we've

224
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,730
done two of these things one was for gmt

225
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:43,659
evaluation this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like some research</font>

226
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,010
you think don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> worry about it</font>

227
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:48,900
essentially all that meant means is that

228
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:52,689
we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to paying a thousand hosts</font>

229
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:55,630
from 33 servers that we had a couple

230
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:57,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">months ago to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a compiler to try</font>

231
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,480
to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a data set that was bigger than</font>

232
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:01,150
the data set that they that the original

233
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,700
paper used that was fun it only took a

234
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,100
couple hours to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run the pings</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

235
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,020
he also have built another tool that to

236
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,970
the build to reverse path tree takes

237
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">trace route takes the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution bang</font>

238
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,520
and builds a tree and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to show</font>

239
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:18,550
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you a little bit more now in</font>

240
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:23,470
pictures so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can try to see what's</font>

241
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:25,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on this is a tree of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paths from</font>

242
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,240
all of the planet labs servers that we

243
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,580
had a month ago to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> desktop machine</font>

244
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,320
and my desktop machine is on a research

245
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">network and most of those planetlab</font>

246
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,340
servers are on research<font color="#CCCCCC"> network so most</font>

247
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:39,339
of the routes go across<font color="#E5E5E5"> abilene some of</font>

248
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:42,160
the stuff on the right the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i</font>

249
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,480
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out with this with this</font>

250
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,240
description is that it was it's

251
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,350
reasonably easy to run these sorts of

252
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,240
distributed active measurement programs

253
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,610
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have some kind of cool</font>

254
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,340
tricks here and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know</font>

255
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:59,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">not just traceroute this is tracy odd as</font>

256
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,870
a tool + alias a solution and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do we</font>

257
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:05,140
perturb the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tray</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 in some interesting</font>

258
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">way that means that once a path hits a</font>

259
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,770
piece of the tree that's already been

260
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,000
traversed it stops it's done that

261
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,900
doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait for time going all</font>

262
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,030
the way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the destination</font>

263
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:22,910
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zoom in a little bit and</font>

264
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:24,650
I'm focus focus on the route<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

265
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,650
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to read this I'm not sure</font>

266
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:29,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the upper right I just want to call</font>

267
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:32,300
attention to a couple things is the

268
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,800
Seattle router on abilene will actually

269
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,510
see two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of its interfaces one that goes</font>

270
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Denver and one that goes to 50 and</font>

271
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:42,050
the merging point of two pieces of the

272
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,689
tree so these things are aliases and I

273
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,880
listed together the line thickness is

274
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,500
trying to give the impression<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

275
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,780
there's a tree right with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trunk and</font>

276
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,400
branches and stuff so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of fun</font>

277
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,020
and somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle there's a</font>

278
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,360
handful of IP addresses with flushes

279
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,579
next to them as you know tracer it

280
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,680
doesn't go everywhere in the network so

281
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:03,170
these are unresponsive successors to the

282
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,370
previous IP address that is you phone IP

283
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,260
address from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traceroute in the next</font>

284
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,510
few hops you would ordinary ordinarily

285
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,730
see stars and then eventually get to

286
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:13,490
someplace and those are just

287
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:17,210
placeholders for those stars if you want

288

kind of reinforce things we were able

00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,959
this tool very efficient that is we can

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:48,170
do all the name lookups with the client

302
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,880
wouldn't have to pollute everyone's name

303
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,900
cash we don't have to retrace the tree

304
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,570
we don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take more than one</font>

ordinary public pressure servers we

307
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,270
could and and what that means is that we

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,719
get you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know 195 trace route packets</font>

to a tool they said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys agree</font>

311
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:10,310
would like the numbers so that that's

that line is there to<font color="#CCCCCC"> appease you it</font>

took for that particular tree it took

it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple part of the</font>

00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:57,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">goal I've highlighted in red all of the</font>

434
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,540
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

435
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,000
right we'd have to create TV back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to</font>

436
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:04,639
study UDP packets wait for TV set

437
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,220
instead of an ICMP port and reachable

439
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:19,220
so our security model it's actually the

440
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:20,870
thing you have to worry about is you

441
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,459
know we're moving we're moving scripts

around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing you have to worry about</font>

443
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:26,959
is is security so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to describe</font>

444
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:32,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">it in two pieces one is about protecting</font>

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:35,540
the hosts we use the interpreter in safe

446

451
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,290
also the duration of the script

452
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,270
execution is limited to like half a

453

455
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,780
the hostess is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> well safeguarded</font>

456
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,960
against code that even who wanted to be

457
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,070
malicious couldn't then you have to

458
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,420
worry about what packets get sent out

459
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,960
and how fast free that sends out to

460
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:11,930
protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network we have rate limits</font>

461
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,280
on per byte per packet and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that shin package have</font>

absolutely no utility and network

464
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,640
measurement we aggressively limit those

465
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,160
to the two very small rate<font color="#CCCCCC"> alpha going</font>

466
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to filter out bad traffic like podcasts</font>

467
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:29,420
frames or fragments or anything like

468
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:32,350
that prevents source spoofing by

00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:35,240
stamping the alkaline source about

470
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,919
there's also a in the architecture a

471
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,660
facility for destination specific

472
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,370

473
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,590
doesn't like getting measurement traffic

474
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,659
like I understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some you can</font>

475
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,550
set up a filter that would be consulted

476
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,220
before generating traffic out to them

477
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:50,889
those addresses

478
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,570
and finally there's a facility for

479
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,370
logging the sent packets on behalf of

480
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,809
whoever asked for them and whoever asked

481
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:58,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">for them presumably had to set up a TCP</font>

482
00:18:55,809 --> 00:19:01,750
connection so it's pretty obvious who

483

who at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least by IP of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us as soon as</font>
