00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:31,460
hi I'm Anna last 150 between you and the

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:38,059
lunch and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only quarter so let's do</font>

6
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:40,780
it quickly we need it I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the first</font>

7
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:43,370
I have to say thank you to judge he

8
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:47,149
cover half of my presentation by

9
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:51,379
coincidence when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

10
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:54,100
telemetry or getting data from the from

11
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:57,739
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network nodes we we are doing that</font>

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:01,250
but we have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very clear that the</font>

13
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:05,479
actual data appears they are collected

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:09,979
in not in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> node in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> atomic parts</font>

15
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:12,649
and elements inside so when we will talk

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network node say Rooter we</font>

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,890
some data are measure it and

21
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,929
traditionally how we do the telemetry

22
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:36,560
today because we do we pull the data we

23
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:39,259
take it over some intervals which is

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,979
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes or more and this</font>

25
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:48,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">way we obscure the dynamics we obscure</font>

26
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:51,049
the short living events we just see the

27
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,649
network in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> average and that's</font>

28
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:57,439
recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> both reasonable for the</font>

slow changing environment and other

31
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,609
interesting observation is that what we

32
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:11,150
are collecting today we are collecting

33
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:13,070
the data we understand so everybody

34
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,470
knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the interface</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a packet</font>

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:33,340

polling base to get to get the data you

41
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:46,489
have to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it individually one by</font>

that's a pain in ass and the data

have to do this exercise again SNMP is

00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:37,129
also quite an efficient even historical

55
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:41,030

00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:03,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes these relevant attributes</font>

66
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:16,849
the moment right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we collect</font>

67

the limited number of data every five

00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">the fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have to ask the same</font>

way very specific for every counter we

76
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,740
have to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole oil</font>

77
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,450
so why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about the telemetry and</font>

78
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,950
need for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the telemetry and why we why we</font>

79
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:02,849
use the telemetry it's because network

80
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:06,240
is the network industry are entering the

81
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,910
new stage right I remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nanak's</font>

82
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,490
back there was a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> panel discussion</font>

83
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:16,310
why the networking is not so interesting

84
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:20,000
not so sexy know why other things are

85
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:24,030
attracts people from the from big

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,960
colleges and universities well it is we

87
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:29,760
just entered the<font color="#E5E5E5"> adulthood right we are</font>

88
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,289
not the network industry is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

89
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:36,510
sexy as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was when i start 95 96 it's</font>

90
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,640
not developing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast in terms of the</font>

91
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,010
new technologies it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

92
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,969
another another protocol every two years

93
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:47,340
as it was in early two thousand but

94
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,130
expectation rise the expectation for the

95
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:53,190
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to be more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solid reliable</font>

96
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:57,360
efficient and efficient efficient so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

97
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:59,340
see that the network in industry I'm not

98
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,680
saying about<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular network but as</font>

99
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:07,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">industry entering the optimization phase</font>

100
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:11,570
and every optimization starts from the

101
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">data collection if you don't have a data</font>

102
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,409
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are blind you don't know what you</font>

103
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,690
can optimize<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much you can optimize</font>

104
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:25,020
and if you optimize do you really

105
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:27,120
optimizer screw up something so we need

106
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:31,049
the infrastructure we neither which

107
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,190
allows us to better deal with the short

108
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:38,340
living events with the micro bursts

109
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:40,500
things and which provides<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data in a</font>

110
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:45,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">run time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or as close to run time as</font>

111
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:49,770
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> because only then we can</font>

112
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:53,820
benefit from the machine learning or big

113
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:57,750
data analytics to find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship</font>

114
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,800
with the data and this comes back to the

115
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,069
position today

116
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,639
two mice I want to recall the statement

117
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:09,039
what you typically do we collect the

118
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,830
counters we understand but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we collect</font>

119
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:15,690
enough data enough data points enough

120
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:19,210
counters and ask the computer networks

121
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:23,349
artificial<font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligence</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe to find</font>

122
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:25,780
the relationship find a pattern in the

123
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the theoretical you're on the first</font>

124
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,919
look in unrelated data then we

125
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,020
understand a whole network behaves

126
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:39,690
behave better to the level we don't

127
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:43,719
today I know it's like an open statement

128
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:47,560
nobody did it yet so it's hard to heart

129
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:51,069
to give example but if you recall<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday</font>

130
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,789
talk of Facebook they said yeah they

131
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:57,099
have this ephemeral ephemeral traffic

132
00:07:54,789 --> 00:08:00,878
which from time to time fills the one of

133
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:03,819
the ecmp link and over a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of month</font>

134
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,599
of the fighting with the program they

135
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:09,940
they find the real find they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that</font>

136
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,940
before it happens there is always some

137
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:16,029
link failure or some topology change in

138
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,770
the network I don't know how much these

139
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:20,279
findings perhaps them to solve the

140
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:23,919
problem but this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

141
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:27,699
high fidelity high volume of telemetry

<font color="#E5E5E5">plus plus big data analytics can give</font>

143
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:37,050
you end of the day this is to enable

144
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:40,390
things like a usage-based provisioning

145

147
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:50,920
good to keep some margin but just that

148
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,689
margin and also to proactive a reaction

149
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:58,240
or proactive optimization on the network

150
00:08:52,690 --> 00:09:03,070
based on the trends or so in this to get

151
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:06,220
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need free building blocks we</font>

152
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,890
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what kind of the data could</font>

153
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:13,550
be taken from the network elements from

154
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:19,580
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network we need to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

155
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:23,870
as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rooters to provide what we were</font>

156
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:27,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">what the OSS system needs we can say</font>

157
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:30,649
controller in these days ah and this is

158
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:33,829
pretty straightforward right I think the

159
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:37,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">current of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course we have to define that</font>

160
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:40,699
but the current tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> netqin Frank</font>

161
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:43,040

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:47,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">conflict it's probably exactly what it's</font>

163
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:51,949
what is needed here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the</font>

164
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:55,760
concept in a greater later in my talk

165
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:58,399
concept of the sensor sensor is like a

166
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,920
thing which sits inside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rooter</font>

167
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,829
inside the network node which is aware

168
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,860
about objects they are going to money to

169
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:09,589
measure or monitor and not and not only

170
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">about one of attribute like one counter</font>

171
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:13,910
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's set of country you can see the</font>

172
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:16,550
example right this interface sensor

173
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:21,740
knows about all interfaces oak all

174
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:26,800
counters related to them and sensor I

175
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:30,709
instantiated where the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually our</font>

176
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,959
measure it so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> do in the interface</font>

177
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:35,719
sensor should be instantiated directly

178
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,869
on the Icicle on directing on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mpu</font>

179
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:45,140
and then sensor is also able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> export</font>

180
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:47,950
data so data in the place the in the

181
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,990
point in the system where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Delta the</font>

182
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:57,760
raw data are collected this is also the

183
00:10:50,990 --> 00:11:01,329
place when the data are exported<font color="#E5E5E5"> I skip</font>

184
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:05,870
probably publishing and subscribing part

185
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:10,089
for the data streaming exporting the

186
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:15,470
actual data from the from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> element</font>

188
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:22,850

191
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,540
is distributed so where the data are

192
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:34,939
collected on NP you for the trial for

<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data plane or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the control</font>

194
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:43,880
playing for the protocols and other

195
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:45,920
things this is where the report is

196
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,189
generated and sent and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

197
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:53,180
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> new concept we do this for</font>

198
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:56,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">the flows jay phlo are generated that</font>

199
00:11:53,180 --> 00:12:01,310
way but here the call is to do this for

200
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:03,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">visual anything and of course the way</font>

201
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,750
how we export what is on the wire is

202
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,200
important because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

203
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:12,110
efficient on the wire on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources</font>

204
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,060
so the cost of generating the ripe

205
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,330
report has to be extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well as</font>

206
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:20,060
possible we want to do this from any<font color="#E5E5E5"> PU</font>

207
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:22,490
we want to do this from architecture

208
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:26,869
perspective from Isaac there is no

209
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:29,950
memory there is no processing power or

210
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:35,090
very limited so we have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

211
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:36,800
careful about that and whatever we do it

212
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:42,380
has to be a flexible that is the

213
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:44,510
extensible so efficiency<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the wire yes</font>

214
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,630
this means that you probably have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

215
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:51,140
send the data as a binary it still could

216
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:53,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">be self-describing format we still could</font>

217
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:57,380
have some information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the data</font>

218
00:12:53,380 --> 00:13:00,770
about the particular counters and<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it</font>

219
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:03,320
into the into the report but it's it has

220
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:09,400
to be embedded in a I said I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said binary</font>

221
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:12,850
numbers and also avoid we need to avoid

222
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:16,459
sending this the redundant information

223
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:20,930
for 1 / 4 if we report the interface

224
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:24,740
stats there is no point to send 19 times

225
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:27,589
the name of the interface and it's

226
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:31,010
enough to send them to us and inside

227
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:33,500
them and uncouple maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

228
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">capsulate but under the interface put</font>

229
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,939
the all relevant information and then

230
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:41,389
moved into another interface

231
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:44,858
what you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is actually what</font>

232
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:51,199
we observe in our experiments<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

233
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:54,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell it later and data modeling that's a</font>

234
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,628
I think the best example is is best to

235
00:13:54,859 --> 00:14:00,199
explain it by example we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to of</font>

236
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:04,849
course have it an ambiguous vendor

237
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:08,899
agnostic or vendor neutral so<font color="#CCCCCC"> with model</font>

238
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:11,919
we try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> model the data as a let's say</font>

239
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:18,169
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a graph that's example for the</font>

240
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:21,309
fabric statistics the every<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vertex</font>

241
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:26,779
of the graph our general things like a

242
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:28,669
Isaac switch plane potentially we can

243
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:32,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">extend this model to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have egress</font>

244
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:36,109
interface for voq system and every edge

245
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:39,978
is unidirectional edge is a set of

246
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:43,309
attributes which tells us whole fabric

247
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:48,470
works between 2 p-8 to I<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 or between</font>

248
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:50,719
Isaac and<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fabric plane or from</font>

249
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,629
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fabric from the Isaac to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> egress</font>

250
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,689
interface when we extend it and then the

251
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:58,549
data structure follows it right so the

252
00:14:56,689 --> 00:15:02,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">fabric is described as a set of edges</font>

253
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:04,759
and each edge has the set of attributes

254
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:08,598
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attributes not have to be equal</font>

255
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:10,309
is same for every edge it if they give

256
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:14,169
an attribute let's say packet counter

257
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:17,779
doesn't exist for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the edge from the</font>

00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:20,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">fabric to the packet processor because</font>

259
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:23,209
there are cells this counter doesn't

260
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:26,059
exist but there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a there will be</font>

261
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:30,108
a counter which which express the cells

262
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:32,868
so it's not fixed format the panic what

263
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:37,009
data are available on given platform on

264
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:40,989
given on given context on given edge the

265
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:40,989
set of data could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

266
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:50,950
why okay fine we have this encoding we

267
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:54,579
have we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably we have efficient</font>

268
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:57,310
way to deliver the data we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it</font>

269
00:15:54,580 --> 00:16:00,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the various points on the system on</font>

270
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:04,660
the high frequency it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> light to</font>

271
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:06,849
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> but why we do that what is the</font>

272
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,089
potential benefit and this is one

273
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:12,510
example let's assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question</font>

274
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:15,250
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i have four interface working my</font>

275
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:18,220
platform has another 2 i'm not using the

276
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:22,060
yet but what will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be impact if i connect</font>

277
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:23,580
if i start using it ah and let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume</font>

278
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:28,900
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are looking at the buffer memory</font>

279
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:32,410
share<font color="#CCCCCC"> it buffer right so if i if i do if</font>

280
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:34,209
i have my high fidelity telemetry so I

281
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,880
have these samples every two seconds of

282
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:39,250
this means that over the week is a two

283
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,170
hundred thousands of samples and I

284
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:45,490
observed that 44 of them which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font>

00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:48,939
0.2% actually it's a one hundred percent

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:53,010
of buffer on utilization probably some

287
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:55,540
losses who cares if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I increase my load</font>

cross the hundred percent utilization

line but that's fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see well it's</font>

296
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:24,310
like a 0.6% or<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero point seven</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

297
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:27,250
percent that's not big<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal why it's</font>

298
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:29,530
better than SNMP because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do the</font>

299
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">same logic with SNMP but taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

300
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:39,610
counters every five seconds I still see

301
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:41,170
44 event of crossing the red line the

302
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:45,729
point is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> these forty four percent</font>

303
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:48,160
is spreaded overhaul week and<font color="#CCCCCC"> is 4444 so</font>

304
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:50,260
not prosper send<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 power events as</font>

305
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,850
predator cross the week and it's not

306
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:56,300
only 44 out of 200,000 but is 44 out of

307
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,870
22 thousand

308
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:03,260
so with the SNMP the same graph will be

309
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:04,909
like show on the by dots it's very flat

310
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:10,129
very close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hundred percent line</font>

311
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:13,160
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I move it up by hand by 1.5 time then</font>

312
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:16,070
most of them may cross the<font color="#E5E5E5"> line and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

313
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,740
hey it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another forty percent losses</font>

314
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:21,260
forty percent of time my my buffer is

315
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:25,640
full that's not what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want same network</font>

316
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:28,490
say traffic if you have if your data are

317
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,390
not accurate not granular enough you

318
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:34,610
cannot do the proper prediction I will

319
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:46,310
skip this example<font color="#CCCCCC"> because in interest of</font>

it's not that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it Hillary</font>

341
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:56,990
theory we do some area experiments with

00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:39,840
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> allows us to generate the reports</font>

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,859
almost all right so it's it's adult

our customer is generally using this for

00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:29,699
like a network state rewind to see what

370
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:32,730
what was the last piece in the past at

371
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:37,169
given moment of time and for bandwidth

372
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:39,749
demands like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> trenton analysis the</font>

373
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:43,980
other sensor was interfaces and it's

00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:46,350
like thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> info we experiment we</font>

did like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a thousand of ports 19th</font>

376
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:51,949
hunters age 64 bits each counter so it's

377
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:55,379
quite safe need significant thing and

378
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:58,649
the report was sent every two seconds so

379
00:21:55,379 --> 00:22:00,059
every interface 19 counters every few

380
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:05,668
seconds and there was a thousand

381
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:07,918
interfaces and we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> independent set</font>

382
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:09,960
the sensor for the interfaces are

the line cuts of the system so the Conte

385
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,449
do central control plane is like even

these generation these data general

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:31,940
and because because these line carbs we

389

have multiple sources we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> also some</font>

394
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:49,730
yeah at the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just general</font>

395
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:52,610
performance management but on the short

396
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:55,790
intervals to see to better see how

397
00:22:52,610 --> 00:23:02,750
dynamic how dynamic is the traffic all

path was also reduced by order of

411
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,420
magnitude and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> relatively simple</font>

412
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,810
because there is no need for scrubbing

413
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:59,540
and there is no opening the net com for

414
00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:02,330
ssh session and taking the CLI outputs

415
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:05,330
then parsing the data was provided

416
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:09,830
straight when the change happens only

417
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:16,929
and with the proper and only the data

418
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:16,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">needed with the proper structure so</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">generation that the better telemetry is</font>

421
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,540
critical because we enter the

00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:30,050
optimization phase with the networking

423
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:33,830
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> more data to have our network</font>

424
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:38,480
working more optimal to better use gear

425
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:40,939
and devices provided by this order

vendor open or white boxes doesn't

all capabilities network provides and

430
00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:00,500
because the network devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

431
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:04,129
scales out then we have more devices and

00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:09,950
can say that yes there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a bigger</font>

434
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:15,200
boxes with<font color="#E5E5E5"> more line cards more I six</font>

435
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:17,660
more more gear inside this<font color="#E5E5E5"> means there</font>

436
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,630
is more objects which you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

437
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,010
monitor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these two things come what</font>

438
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,950
happens together so we have like a

439
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:27,470
magnification effect we need something

440
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:31,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">better than SNMP to work with the scale</font>

441
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:34,250
and I not say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> telemetry will</font>

442
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,040
replace the SNMP in first in feature

443
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:40,670
there are things which are SNMP is there

444
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,639
right and building the models for

445
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:49,040
everything SNMP develop our meep has

446
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:52,850
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> i dunno 20-30 years I think 1988</font>

447
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,620
was the beginning of the SNMP so this

448
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:58,719
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take time so we talk about</font>

449
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:01,389
augmentation this new architecture new

450
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,700
technology for<font color="#CCCCCC"> telemetry is more to</font>

451
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:08,690
augment SNMP when it's needed for the

452
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:11,180
scale or for high fidelity and the last

453
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:14,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">but not least more data and more</font>

454
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:18,440
sophisticated<font color="#CCCCCC"> data analytics is</font>

455
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:21,070
something which yet to be discovered the

456
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:28,520
benefits of it it's yet to be discovered

457
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:29,990
it's like yeah dry journey behind the

458
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,290
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what's there</font>

459
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:38,290
but the things is there we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

460
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:38,290
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's there thank you much</font>
