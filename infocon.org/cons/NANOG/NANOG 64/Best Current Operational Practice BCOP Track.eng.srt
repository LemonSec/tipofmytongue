1
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:16,130
good morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone you've wandered</font>

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,750
into the nanog<font color="#CCCCCC"> DCOP track the best</font>

3
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:21,669
current operational practices hopefully

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:23,900
that's where you meant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be Thanks</font>

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,029
first of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of a quick show</font>

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:30,890
of hands who has been to a bc o P track

7
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:33,560
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who has not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been to a</font>

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">PCO paycheck ever before Wow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome ok</font>

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,640
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to change the beginning</font>

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,780
a little bit we'll talk a little bit

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,580
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what we're doing here and why</font>

12
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:47,750
so most information if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to kind</font>

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:49,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">of follow along is at bc o pn org for</font>

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,350
now what we're really trying to

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,420
accomplish here is taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the</font>

16
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,580
great material the presentations and

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,700
knowledge that is swarming around nanog

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,989
and condense that into actual written

19
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,780
form that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then reference later</font>

20
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:04,400
what we find right now is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">times when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to look up how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,509
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you're configuring a BGP</font>

23
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,130
for the first time maybe you're setting

24
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:12,140
up is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on a network and you've only</font>

25
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,060
run<font color="#CCCCCC"> out ospf whatever the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case may be</font>

26
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,229
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always times where we need to do</font>

27
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,929
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up a DNS server</font>

28
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:19,340
right in your router guy and that

29
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:21,200
information is out there obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

30
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,249
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is running quite well and</font>

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,869
the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come to these meetings</font>

32
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,908
are some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones who make that all</font>

33
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:27,530
happen we<font color="#CCCCCC"> give presentations to each</font>

34
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:28,969
other talk about things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the hallway</font>

35
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,380
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you know the right guy to ask</font>

36
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:32,538
it's fairly easy to find this

37
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,789
information but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't if you're</font>

38
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:37,789
new you're starting a network in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gambia</font>

39
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:39,109
if you are you know working in a small

40
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:41,270
company and don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to these</font>

41
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:42,979
kind of meetings those resources are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

42
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,420
available to and what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

43
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:45,920
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that available to everyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want</font>

44
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,619
to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the internet run better by</font>

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,609
writing down the way we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing things</font>

46
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:50,899
updating those documents frequently

47
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,149
there are going to be living documents

48
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:56,179
so that you always know that it's the

49
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:57,469
best current operational practice if you

50
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:59,479
want to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's written</font>

51
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:01,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">down in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VCO p you know you can at</font>

52
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,560
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> start from there right there's</font>

53
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">always kind of an 8020 rule there's</font>

54
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be exceptions to everything</font>

55
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:08,630
some people do things differently than

56
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:09,619
others some people use<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

57
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be distinguished</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sures in their</font>

58
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:13,490
network or are in corner cases for

59
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,800
whatever reason i need to change things

60
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we want these to cover you know most</font>

61
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,549
of the time this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the best way to do</font>

62
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,049
things and then agree on that as a

63
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:22,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">community and then publish them as a</font>

64
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:23,840
community so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really for Engineers</font>

65
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,370
by engineers

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,140
a really open transparent bottom-up

67
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,910
process with all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being said if you</font>

68
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,040
think that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> effort it'd be worth</font>

69
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:37,099
while<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get as involved as you can we'd</font>

70
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,239
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciate that right now the the</font>

71
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:39,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">wiki and the fact that there's a</font>

72
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,260
committee at nanog and all of that

73
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:44,299
there's some murkiness we're going to

74
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,950
mix signals from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board as to whether</font>

75
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:50,060
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not this will continue as a nanog</font>

76
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:52,579
activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm confused by that because to</font>

77
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,890
me if we're not here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about how</font>

78
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:58,069
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> operate networks I'm not sure what</font>

79
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're doing but for your own paper</font>

80
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:02,390
thought that drinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some</font>

81
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,530
drinking going on so so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is so</font>

82
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,268
for those of your first timers knows

83
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,500
you've ever been here before both this

84
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,459
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you see as important and</font>

85
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,280
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we should continue</font>

86
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:11,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do I'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other bc</font>

87
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,069
o P committee members would hear that

88
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think the board should probably</font>

89
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:17,328
hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so without further ado I'm</font>

90
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:18,379
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move forward a little bit from</font>

91
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:20,239
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the kind of introductory</font>

92
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:22,609
stuff and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vco</font>

93
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">piece so we just published a new one</font>

94
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,049
actually after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last meeting ethernet</font>

95
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,000
oam which gives general<font color="#CCCCCC"> ethernet OEM</font>

96
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:31,160
orientation and guidelines the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is</font>

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,049
again like all bc op's it's really

98
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,280
accessible it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of just the bare</font>

99
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:36,560
bones of what you need to know to get

100
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,660
started and then references out to where

101
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,920
to go from there you see the shepherd

102
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,880
was mark hawkins one of our bc o P

103
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,250
committee members and a few uh thanks

104
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,590
mark and a few subject matter experts

105
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,180
here and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not the BC op's work so</font>

106
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we write these is as a shepherd</font>

107
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,660
always assigned who kind of steers the

108
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,000
boat make sure everything all the cats

109
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,530
stay together and then subject matter

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,870
experts which may or may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

111
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:03,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">Shepherd are the ones who actually</font>

112
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,819
produce the content and write it in the

113
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,709
past<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the BC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Opie's I've written I've</font>

114
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:08,660
pulled information that people have

115
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:10,579
written in responses to questions on the

116
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,079
Nano mailing list and pulled them into a

117
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,040
document and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> told them hey guess</font>

118
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,410
what you're not there on a document

119

121
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,950
people to write things I will talk a

122
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get people</font>

123

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,640
right I just to give you an update on

140
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,250
that he does<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack guys we started this</font>

141
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:15,440
back last year<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was one of the first</font>

142
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:16,970
ones after so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests for it there</font>

143
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,920
was a lot of you probably if you follow

144
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the non oculus you probably see a lot of</font>

145
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,390
emails going about the dots it's always

146
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:25,580
a recurrent topic that happens right so

147
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:29,030
the idea was well we are networking

148
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:32,270
engineers willingly or unwillingly need

149
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:34,039
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved with this is that the</font>

150
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:41,299
security guy oh this is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on its own</font>

151
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:43,550
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me just go back here and so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

152
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,530
were some participants I was at sharper

153
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,710
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped a little bit on putting it</font>

154
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:50,150
all together<font color="#E5E5E5"> but credit goes to this</font>

155
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,510
means there and there are other people

156
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,760
also contributed try to keep us a line

157
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,920
and sharing the information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've</font>

158
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,830
seen some of them are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> experts on</font>

159
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so they try to cheer stuff so</font>

160
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:08,719
they're probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> missing 11 name there</font>

161
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:10,789
too<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> summary what is this pick</font>

162
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,250
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> in tentative really is just trying to</font>

163
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:17,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">put together in a cohesive way all the</font>

164
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,700
information we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can for for the you</font>

165
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,990
know dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with adults or D dots</font>

166
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,060
essentially making it like a set of

167
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,010
steps there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of information you</font>

168
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,420
can go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

169
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,370
whole day pro the whole week just

170
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,500
reading about it and becoming an expert

171
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,710
at it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not the goal right so</font>

172
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,330
we try to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

173
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:37,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">context so if you want to go into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

174
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,960
details go into the beaker page that

175
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:45,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chris mentioned and you'll find it there</font>

176
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:48,380
essentially the idea is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a set</font>

177
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,580
of clear list of steps of what you can

178
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">do right you when you are being</font>

179
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,659
under attack or you're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

180
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,629
you probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what's what</font>

181
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:59,340
what to do before what to do do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in</font>

182
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:01,289
the attack on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you do after the</font>

183
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,818
attack so it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh my god</font>

184
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:04,259
I'm getting attacked what should i do

185
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,150
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read the whole google stuff</font>

186
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,759
about the dots or what should<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do so</font>

187
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,409
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is okay here's a few few steps</font>

188
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,050
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know some of the</font>

189
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:15,150
people have have tested it they've used

190
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,250
them before and that's the idea so

191
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">whenever you go there there is like a</font>

192
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:24,629
pro there's like 11 steps actually nine

193
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,550
steps about prior what you do prior one

194
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:28,979
of them is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how to and there's some</font>

195
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,020
like with<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten steps about evaluating</font>

196
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:32,818
solutions and different vendors out

197
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,590
there then there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I feel them</font>

198
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,719
that you can do during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack and</font>

199
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:40,138
they're very few then because once your

200
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:44,610
attack that's it you don't meet after

201
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:47,039
after that after that there is some what

202
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,259
to do after right some people start

203
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,050
wondering about okay who should I report

204
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:55,560
to who can I complain right who can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

205
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:57,599
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> given my my whining who can I who</font>

206
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,550
can help me on this can I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to my</font>

207
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,590
police down the street<font color="#CCCCCC"> or what should I</font>

208
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:06,629
do so we kind of go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as well so</font>

209
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:10,698
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to read it essentially the</font>

210
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:13,770
idea about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pickup we had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

211
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:15,690
comments we send some emails if you fall

212
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,940
in the net naki mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

213
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:20,430
lot of comments back we we thought we

214
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,919
were done at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> this means we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

215
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,199
thought we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done and then comments</font>

216
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,150
keep coming just like chris says this is

217
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,580
a living document the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for us to</font>

218
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,929
kind of share all the information and

219
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,799
gather the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information that can be</font>

220
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:37,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">useful in dealing with it does so it is</font>

221
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,260
ratified we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like</font>

222
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,089
ratified<font color="#CCCCCC"> done with it it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a draft</font>

223
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,540
anymore but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hell does that</font>

224
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:48,390
really mean right so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just means that</font>

225
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,430
it is it is just good enough to to be

226
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">implemented it makes sense what we have</font>

227
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,719
there might be missing some details

228
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,149
maybe we need to up some stuff here and

229
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,310
there but it is ready to to really be

230
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:00,870
chair for everybody so that's what

231
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,599
really means so what is the next step on

232
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,259
that it's a living<font color="#E5E5E5"> document we got to</font>

233
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,809
keep

234
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:09,149
in it adding more stuff questioning what

235
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:12,089
we have there maybe this part is is

236
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:14,189
being used much more now so that's what

237
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:17,279
we're really trying to do so if you feel

238
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:20,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">like that you have some contributions to</font>

239
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,619
the whole community if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been a</font>

240
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:26,789
victim and you you got some lessons

241
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:28,679
learned please share with us<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font>

242
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:30,449
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other nice to add content there as</font>

243
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:33,419
well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only about what to do</font>

244
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:35,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">before during and after it but it's also</font>

245
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:39,119
about some of them things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

246
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:42,660

<font color="#CCCCCC">sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop</font>

251
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:54,089
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right maybe UDP port 0 we talked a</font>

252
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:56,309
little bit about that actually maybe

253
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:58,979
that's the way just block be a UDP block

254
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:02,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d does mitigation</font>

260
00:10:11,789 --> 00:10:17,939
also want to include them in there so

experience when the legal and the law

263

265
00:10:25,619 --> 00:10:29,279
there's thunder answer from those guys

266
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:31,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">is yeah we're interested let us know we</font>

271
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,589
about adding to the B Cup was about

272
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:48,569
maybe we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> start educating people</font>

273
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:51,509
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the stuff that is there if you</font>

274
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:52,949

319
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,460
they are clearly readable to the

417
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,240
mentioned this is a rather new effort

418
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,399
we're just getting started in<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting and this meeting with a</font>

420
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,290
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our discussions the idea for this</font>

421
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,840
effort originally came to my knowledge

422
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,960
nanog 60 at one of the ice<font color="#CCCCCC"> McCadden</font>

424
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,470
a lot of the initial effort to drum up

425
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,520
interest in this area<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i want to thank</font>

426
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:29,100
him for for that now raise your hand if

427
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,840
you or your organization receives

428
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,090
maintenance notifications or you

429
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,280
generate maintenance notifications right

430
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:38,010
it's just about everybody everybody

431
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,260
deals with this most the time we receive

432
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,790
these messages via email it's the common

433
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,280
way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we send and receive them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

434
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:46,590
there's no real consistent format for

00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,720
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> messages every vendor has a</font>

436
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,679
different format they<font color="#E5E5E5"> often form at</font>

437
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,460
things differently depending on the

438
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:55,020
service and many of us manually process

439

these notifications raise your hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

444
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,420
a pretty good process it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

451
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,240
we like to think of from the perspective

452
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,889
of the vendor we might add calendar

453
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,150
entries to some central calendar so we

454
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,710
can see across all the different

461
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,660
it and when we do all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

462
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:55,470
manually we encounter the possibility

<font color="#CCCCCC">for error how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you have generated</font>

machines can do much better than we can

478
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,419
and you know if we're fine with making

479
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,460
other people do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it why not make machines</font>

480
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:42,010
do it but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some significant</font>

481
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:45,010
barriers to doing this all of these

482
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:46,570
notifications if a vendor has templates

483
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,070
that they use to generate them they're

484
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,320
not standardized across all the

485
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,120
different providers the templates are

486
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,370
often guidelines they're not strictly

487
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:57,279
followed by every vendor and internally

488
00:20:54,370 --> 00:21:00,039
and these templates can change vendors

489
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,149
may decide they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to adopt a slightly</font>

490
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:03,100
different format and they don't tell

491
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:04,268
anyone that they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so these</font>

492
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some of the challenges that we see</font>

493
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:09,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and why we feel that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a need for</font>

494
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:13,899
standardization and can some consistency

495
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:16,210
in this area our goals for this we want

496
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:17,799
to preserve<font color="#E5E5E5"> the existing format we think</font>

497
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of value in human</font>

499
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,750

00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,960
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that remains for anyone who wants</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to adopt this approach want to ensure</font>

additional trouble so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

505
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,969
to do is to add on some formatted

information to those notifications in

529
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:28,110
suggested hey you know maintenances

530
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:30,180
they're kind of like events and we have

531
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:32,219
this protocol already ki kal that we all

532
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,350
use to schedule events across

533
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,630
organizations so why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font>

534
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,770
using that don't reinvent the wheel see

535
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:39,840
if you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work with</font>

536
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,700
what's already there so we looked into

537
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,959
this and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that there's a lot of</font>

539
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,410

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular one things we like about</font>

541
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:50,820
iCal is that there's a format that's

542

558
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:33,180
the value of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> iCal it's really about</font>

559
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:35,670
compatibility with existing consumers so

560
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:37,320
if you add an email<font color="#CCCCCC"> attachment to a main</font>

561
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:39,300
and certification that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has iCal</font>

562
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,870
compatible information that can be

consumed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by all existing iCal compatible</font>

564
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:47,340
programs today and there's some

565
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,020
immediate benefits that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are if</font>

566
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,250
you're speaking now on the vendor side

567
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,960
right to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers there's an</font>

00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,580
immediate benefit to sending these

569
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,500
attachments your customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font>

570
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,520
calendar entries automatically without

571
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:01,890
any additional effort on their part

572
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,690
progress to date at first we worked on

573
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,430
trying to identify what we thought were

574
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:09,110
feels that should be mandatory that

575
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:12,390
should always be<font color="#CCCCCC"> present for for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

576
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:14,100
standard and what we thought might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

577
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,690
just optional things that people can

578
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,399
include if they wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they</font>

579
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,410
weren't really critical so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

580
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,640
list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mandatory fields</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

581
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,930
identified obviously you need to know

582
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,480
when the maintenance windows start and

583
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:28,230
end there should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be unique identifier</font>

584
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,230
for who the provider is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> found that</font>

585
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,270
some organizations have

586
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,790
multiple units internally that<font color="#CCCCCC"> consume</font>

587
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">the services of a single provider so we</font>

588
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought including</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an account ID</font>

589
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:39,049
associated with the services on that

590
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:41,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintence will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful for</font>

591
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:42,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">dispatching internally we need a</font>

592
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,030
maintenance ID that uniquely identifies

593
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,489
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintenance from every other</font>

594
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:48,678
maintenance that the provider is

595
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:50,179
announced and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then all the objects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

596
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:52,100
are going to be acted on by this

597
00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:54,220
maintenance so in the context of

598
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:59,090
networking this could be circuit IDs or

599
00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:01,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP IP peers our peer IPS or for other</font>

600
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:03,409
services<font color="#E5E5E5"> again the is example this could</font>

601
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a virtual host ID or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something of</font>

602
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:08,500
that nature and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> impact is the</font>

603
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:12,168
service impacting is advisory<font color="#CCCCCC"> only etc</font>

604
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:14,809
we also worked on testing whether our

605
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:17,090
theory of using extensions was going to

606
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:18,710
work in the real world so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we came up</font>

607
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:22,189
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some mock emails with attachments</font>

608
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:23,200
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> maintence notifications we ran those</font>

609
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,460
through a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different systems</font>

610
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">Apple calendar outlook google calendar</font>

611
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,549
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered was there was really</font>

612
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,530
good support<font color="#E5E5E5"> for these extensions in the</font>

613
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:32,690
sense that we could generate them and

614
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,220
send them to these systems the<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems</font>

615
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:36,679
appropriately responded to all the

616
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,419
standard ical data and ignored all the

617
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:41,150
ex setters so what this means is that

618
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:42,500
you can use this approach to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add in</font>

619
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,510
calendar information notifications

620
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,480
there's additional information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

621
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:50,169
can add to make sure that you can parse

622
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,429
some critical fields in the notification

623
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:53,450
but the existing systems ignore those

624
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:55,520
they're there if you want to take

625
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">advantage of it but they don't impede</font>

626
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,160
anything if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

627
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">example of one of the tests that we ran</font>

628
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:08,230
this is google calendar on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right is</font>

629
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:10,580
a detailed view of the event with the

630
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:12,650
detailed text<font color="#CCCCCC"> Egyptian this is the human</font>

631
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:15,230
readable part contained in the body and

632
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:17,179
as you can see the start and in time is

633
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:19,640
encoded in time zone of mountain

634
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:21,770
daylight time and as you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font>

635
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a counter application that gets</font>

636
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:26,330
displayed and converted automatically to

00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:30,620

639
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,760
again this is we're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting started</font>

640
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:38,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we're working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting to the</font>

642
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,410
pretty critical to have some

643
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,480
implementation out there and the

644
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:46,150
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can bang on and and look at</font>

645
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,740
to further understand what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we're</font>

646
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:50,440
working with and to encourage adoption

647
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:53,920
so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create some libraries and</font>

648
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,840
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as example scripts to implement</font>

649
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,850
these extensions and then do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

650
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,149
interesting things with them we want to

651
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:02,949
document this work and the extensions

652
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:05,800
and then circulate it<font color="#CCCCCC"> back through the</font>

653
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,980
community for input our<font color="#E5E5E5"> near-term goal</font>

654
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,690
is to publish a beat cop document and

655
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,670
because we're extending an RFC we think

656
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:15,040
the ultimate destination for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> effort</font>

657
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:17,520
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to standardize the extensions that</font>

658
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,129
we're proposing through the RFC process

659
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,840
so to do all this we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> your help</font>

everyone's<font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome to participate we're</font>

00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">ideas around cryptography yeah it's a</font>

702
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:14,010
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good question see the implication</font>

703
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,320
here is if we can automate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

704
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,820
processing of these messages<font color="#CCCCCC"> in theory</font>

705
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,929
it's possible to use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an input</font>

706
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,030
into a system that takes some

707
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:22,770
administrative action on our networks so

708
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:24,629
for example if we get a notification for

709
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,950
providers saying such and such a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pier is</font>

710
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:28,260
going to go down at<font color="#E5E5E5"> such-and-such time</font>

711
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:29,670
you could drain traffic off that period

712
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,890
advance notification take it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

713
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:33,390
service and then after the maintenance

714
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,980
is completed and you verify that the

715
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:38,190
pier is returned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to service then put it</font>

716
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:40,410
put traffic back on on that session<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

717
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:41,820
well obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some security</font>

718
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:44,430
implications for that we all we all get

719
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the current effort we're working on</font>

720
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:47,880
formatting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information we're not</font>

721
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:50,820
really focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what you can do with</font>

722
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,740
it we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to separate the format</font>

723
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,149
of the content from the issues of

724
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:58,050
transport utilization but that's

725
00:29:54,150 --> 00:30:00,000
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a valid concern and PGP</font>

726
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:01,649
signing of email is a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential</font>

727
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,660
way to handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> that webdav is another</font>

728
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:06,090
mechanism using accessing that

729
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,950
information over HTTPS it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

730
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">do the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of verification of the</font>

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">information you're getting with this</font>

732
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,719
cryptography and in that mechanism as

733
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:14,340
well so we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are potential</font>

734
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,260
solutions of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems if things go</font>

735
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,720
in that direction<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's why I</font>

736
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned Cal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that specifically and if</font>

737
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,720
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have feedback or comments on the</font>

738
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,680
security implications of that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

739
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,300
that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important to</font>

740
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">consider at this stage of the game as</font>

741
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,760
well one thing I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to note about all</font>

742
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:31,320
that unfortunately today I don't think

743
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">I've seen a single magnets notification</font>

744
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,549
email PGP sign or

745
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,950
encrypted so at a minimum we're not

746
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:41,049
making the problem worse just by

747
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:43,779
formatting the data that the problem

748
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:45,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">already exists certainly it's possible</font>

749
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:48,490
to create a real issue out of this if

750
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:50,678
you take automatic action based on that

751
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:54,570
information without<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of weight</font>

752
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:58,500
means of verification is there any

753
00:30:54,570 --> 00:31:01,379
internalization effort to make this

754
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,700
support for multiple languages and

755
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:05,350
automatic selection of this languages

756
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,260
because if your global network key

757
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:10,959
operating in many languages that's quite

758
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:12,970
complex challenge and I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea how</font>

759
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,059
to get this done but if you have to be

760
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:18,789
done yeah it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good point so in terms</font>

761
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:21,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">of multiple programming language support</font>

762
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:24,929
ical is already available or their

763
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:27,820
libraries that can speak and read ical

764
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:29,080
in many different languages so if we're

765
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:33,010
building off that protocol to start

766
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,779
that's a help for<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're trying to</font>

767
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:37,330
work on we're demoing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python at the</font>

768
00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:38,169
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we would like to see other</font>

769
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,939
people hopefully contribute

770
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:42,100
implementations and other computer

771
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,960
languages as well in terms of natural

772
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:47,189
languages I don't know if that's a

773
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,740
question as well that you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah</font>

774
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:52,510
boy I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any immediate answer</font>

775
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,039
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not an issue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we discuss so</font>

776
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,860
I'd love for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> participate if you</font>

777
00:31:54,039 --> 00:32:01,320
have ideas or any<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggestions on what</font>

778
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:05,080
you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to do in that area I</font>

779
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:08,769
see that it can cause a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of pain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

780
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:11,830
if you just opt out for plain English in

781
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:14,110
some cases your framework would not be

782
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,970
just acceptable for many general

783
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,769
copywriters that are out there plus I

784
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,110
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the list of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> persons you</font>

785
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:24,639
got creme de la creme of pine and

786
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:26,649
hackers good<font color="#CCCCCC"> too yeah so that's why</font>

787
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:28,330
we're here is to get more input in more

788
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:30,518
participants I think those are very

789
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:34,330
valid points and we'd love to see people

790
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:38,169
participate to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address them great</font>

791
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:39,250
anything else all right feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

792
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:43,289
reach out during the rest the conference

793
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:43,289
if things come up or online<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

794
00:32:55,289 --> 00:33:00,639
the real um just quickly on the other

795
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,408
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this there's a shepherd's or</font>

796
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:04,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">smees in the room that want to talk</font>

797
00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:06,639
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ebgp or the public peering</font>

798
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:07,870
those are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just moving along I</font>

799
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:09,189
would say if you're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

800
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,979
two topics definitely take a look at the

801
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:13,750
drafts that are currently in progress

802
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,220
obviously most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens</font>

803
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">on these documents as you just heard</font>

804
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,820
from both presentations happens on

805
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:20,139
mailing lists or on conference calls or

806
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,750
in person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here we're kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of just</font>

807
00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:25,090
talking about progress and things ebgp

808
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,039
configuration has hit a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

809
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:30,039
wall potentially there's a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

810
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">decision point there the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF just</font>

811
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:33,970
published a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp that covers almost all</font>

812
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,709
the things we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to cover in</font>

813
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,870
this document so there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

814
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:40,059
there of do we step back now and not

815
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:42,219
write the bc o P since the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp has been</font>

816
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:44,740
written and published as an RFC from the

817
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,389
IHF or because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> these to be</font>

818
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,919
living documents and maybe change faster

819
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:50,019
than what we've typically seen from the

820
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,909
IETF do we still go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> write it</font>

821
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:53,620
reference the existing document and keep

822
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:55,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">moving so that's kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the existing</font>

823
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,428
question right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so if you have</font>

824
00:33:55,090 --> 00:34:01,570
thoughts on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that definitely jump on bc o</font>

825
00:33:57,429 --> 00:34:02,830
P at nana org and let us know or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

826
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:07,389
find again the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shepherds and</font>

00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:09,279
sneeze on<font color="#CCCCCC"> vco Pete nanog org and talk to</font>

828
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:12,339
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks directly they're probably</font>

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">here as well the public barian exchange</font>

830
00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:15,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just meant is another one that's</font>

831
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:17,980
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of moving along basically updated</font>

832
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:21,639
an older document that talked about both

833
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:23,260
how to set up in exchange and also how

834
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,940
to participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one kind of a little</font>

835
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of both sides of it and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decided</font>

836
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,510
to split<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out in this second version</font>

837
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:31,030
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the first documents</font>

838
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:32,589
we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> really that living part of</font>

00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,119
the living document part<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen where we</font>

00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:36,520
took a document that we wrote said well

841
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:38,829
we can do better one of them split off

842
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,079
and the euro euro IX folks wrote up a

843
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:42,399
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice bc o P so we kind of said ok</font>

844
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,950
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bc o P that we're going to</font>

845
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,679
point to for setting up an exchange and

846
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:49,569
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new update</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the nanog bc o P is</font>

847
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,579
focusing on how do you participate well

848
00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:52,869
at an exchange so again if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

849
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:54,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">something you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about or need</font>

850
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:57,440
information on

851
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,870
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> check out that vco p before i</font>

852
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,160
jump to the next we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maracay in</font>

853
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:09,140
the room was working on some really cool

854
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:12,259
bc p38 type anti spoofing filtering type

855
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:14,629
things so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a few</font>

856
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:17,900
words of what you're working on that'd

857
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:20,390
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool hopefully unfortunate spot too</font>

858
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,950
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh no Aaron</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just walked back and</font>

859
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:25,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">said hey you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it I'm</font>

860
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:28,430
like yeah sure so um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like using</font>

861
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:30,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">the words bc p38 because people are</font>

862
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:35,109
globally don't really understand what

863
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:35,110
that means so oh oh you want me to go

864
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:53,890
okay so this is work that I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font>

865
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,660
about a year and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> half ago maybe even</font>

866
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:58,240
two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I was sitting at a right</font>

867
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,410
meeting and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> having lunch with a</font>

868
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,209
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different folks from different</font>

869
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:03,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISPs from around the world actually</font>

870
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:06,730

871
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:08,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">right region and the Aaron region and we</font>

872
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:10,660
started talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about wow you know</font>

873
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,129
there's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> spoofed traffic and so I</font>

874
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">said you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of funny because</font>

875
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:18,340
everybody talks about bcp 38 I certainly

876
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:19,990
remember being in Japan and people you

877
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,690
know listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to somebody talk about</font>

878
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:25,359
bcp 38 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stopped the speaker and</font>

879
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:27,760
said sorry but hold on a second how many

880
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Abby's p38 is every kind of</font>

881
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,690
looking at me funny and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said how many</font>

882
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:34,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you do anti spoof filtering everybody</font>

883
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:36,760
raised<font color="#CCCCCC"> their hands right and so one of</font>

884
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:39,010
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've recognized as</font>

885
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,270
we've been talking to people about you

886
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:43,030
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the deed haces that are happening</font>

887
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:46,330
and other malicious traffic where people

888
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:49,960
are spoofing that there are mechanisms

889
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:51,910
to do anti spoofing however depending on

890
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,610
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> equipment that they use depending on</font>

891
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:56,140
which methodologies you use and you know

892
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:59,160
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of new people coming into</font>

893
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:01,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">the industry all the time and so it</font>

894
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,660
became clear that be useful to have kind

895
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,270
of a cookbook type of document right not

896
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:09,520
the fact that spoofing still exists but

897
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:11,380
how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually mitigate mitigated</font>

898
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,150
in your environments so what kind of

899
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,790
equipment problems have people seen

900
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:18,040
where you put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> two line access list in</font>

901
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:19,690
and the equipment just<font color="#E5E5E5"> falls over right</font>

902
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,910
in some of these bugs haven't been fixed

903
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:24,490
in 10 years their legacy equipment that

904
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:26,379
still exists in people's environment so

905
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:28,779
you know there's random people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were</font>

906
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:32,470
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> also in juniper</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cisco</font>

907
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:34,540
alcatel-lucent who you know talked about

908
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:37,839
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of these bugs so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

909
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:39,970
capture them all in a document and I've

910
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,430
corralled a couple of people I've also

911
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:44,080
trolled the<font color="#CCCCCC"> na nóg list last year for</font>

912
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:47,620
you know the two or three hundred

913
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:49,900
messages that dealt with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp 38 and</font>

914
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:51,160
spoofing trend and so people that work

915
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,230
loofah land said something

916
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,970
not just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus one and yeah that's a</font>

917
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem here nobody isn't doing anything</font>

918
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,750
about it I don't care about those

919
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,120
statements I care about the statements

920
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:05,140
that says equipment this<font color="#E5E5E5"> still has an</font>

921
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:07,540
issue so we do XYZ and so this document

922
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:10,210
is meant to actually show how you can do

923
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:13,900
anti spoofing using either flow<font color="#E5E5E5"> specs</font>

924
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:18,820
savvy route filters packet filters you r

925
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:20,350
PF and also showing what kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> caveats</font>

926
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">are with different kinds of equipment</font>

927
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:25,120
and so since I'm the main author and

928
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:27,670
it's purely volunteer work you know I

929
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,440
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've sent Aaron about 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> messages</font>

930
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,810
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last year going oh you're just</font>

931
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:35,830
another week i'll ship it out right

932
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:37,779
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> about two months ago I was in</font>

933
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:40,180
Singapore for the icam meeting and I ran

934
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,340
into Barry<font color="#CCCCCC"> Green who some of you may</font>

935
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:45,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">know he's done a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work with anti</font>

936
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:48,850
spoofing and I will say the words bcp 38

937
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:50,830
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said you know just ship what you</font>

938
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:52,990
have the draft and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a look</font>

939
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:55,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">at it put in all my thoughts and then we</font>

940
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:56,970
can ship it out and so that's that's the

941
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,650
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where it's at right now</font>

942
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:01,240

943
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,620
this because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fact that you know</font>

944
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,259
everybody's very interested in the

945
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:09,190

00:39:57,449 --> 00:40:01,140
that's why I'm speaking here because I

963
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:04,348
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out where it should</font>

964
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:06,209
reside right but because I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

965
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:09,089
many conversations with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron about this</font>

966
00:40:06,209 --> 00:40:10,739
specifically i thought you know having

967
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:12,599
it be a beat cop and because its

968
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:15,329
operational right i mean i also

969
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,910
contribute to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF so part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

970
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:20,849
like well bcp document there but really

971
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:22,890
it's an operational document and i asked

972
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:25,169
the operators that have contributed so

973
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:27,449
far that also represent<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right region</font>

974
00:40:25,169 --> 00:40:29,489
and AP<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick region whether or not they</font>

975
00:40:27,449 --> 00:40:31,049
had an issue with you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cop and</font>

976
00:40:29,489 --> 00:40:33,569
nanog or whatever and they said we don't

977
00:40:31,049 --> 00:40:38,219
care you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is useful information</font>

978
00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:41,429
for the community question well I know

979
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:45,419
your paints I actually had nationally

980
00:40:41,429 --> 00:40:49,829
for two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago to implement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp 38a</font>

981
00:40:45,419 --> 00:40:51,449
in my region in Russia and we realize

982
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:54,299
that fundamental problem for

983
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:56,789
implementing it is lack of<font color="#E5E5E5"> incentive you</font>

984
00:40:54,299 --> 00:41:01,589
have to do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of work</font>

985
00:40:56,789 --> 00:41:04,369
consistently months two months and yours

986
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:08,549
only one who's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> benefiting of results</font>

987
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:12,689
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I decided that we should give some</font>

988
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:15,529
benefits and I I got support from Y and

989
00:41:12,689 --> 00:41:18,118
X Y and X Russian<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google basically and</font>

990
00:41:15,529 --> 00:41:22,279
they have a lot of marketing power and

991
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:24,929
PR power and we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's no do not</font>

992
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:26,909
name and shaming let's do Hall of Fame

993
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:31,439
whoever supports the network's the best

994
00:41:26,909 --> 00:41:35,369
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we basically failed at the moment</font>

995
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:40,519
where we were not able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to verify if this</font>

996
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:43,589
network does in fact supports bcp 38 and

997
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:47,308
frankly<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaking ripe Atlas wasn't</font>

998
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:51,449
cooperative they had the reasons I see

999
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:54,169
them but there is no way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to legitimately</font>

1000
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:56,849
check if this network complies and

1001
00:41:54,169 --> 00:41:58,979
that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem so you could not build</font>

1002
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:01,289
this list of well managed at networks

1003
00:41:58,979 --> 00:42:03,859
because i think it's it's important when

1004
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:06,739
customer makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a decision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

1005
00:42:03,859 --> 00:42:09,499
he wants to his his upstream he wants

1006
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:12,200
not only the cheapest price but also

1007
00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:15,319
well connected and most importantly well

1008
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,899
managed network and bc pc or the aid is

1009
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:25,308
clear sciences this<font color="#E5E5E5"> network is well</font>

1010
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:28,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">managed right so i failed and i am not</font>

1011
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:32,299
easy on failures<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am stubborn and i</font>

1012
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,730
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something different than pc</font>

1013
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:38,239
pc re aight i think it's it's dead in

1014
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:42,799
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> word because the you RPF doesn't</font>

1015
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:45,739
work the way it<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be it works fine</font>

1016
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:47,749
on the access level it doesn't work<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1017
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:50,239
aggregation level take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ross</font>

1018
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:53,118
telecom they connect lots of small ISPs

1019
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,680
and smallest piece is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> source of a</font>

1020
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,489
problem here<font color="#CCCCCC"> because usually they are</font>

1021
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:01,848
understaffed they are lack of expertise

1022
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:06,619
and they basically they they don't give

1023
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:08,900
a and it comes to the aggregation

1024
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:11,499
layer and an aggregation layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

1025
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:14,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">jelka got hundreds of thousands of</font>

1026
00:43:11,499 --> 00:43:17,749
prefixes that have to be filtered and

1027
00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:21,230
different hardware reacts differently<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1028
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:24,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so I had this idea if we can gather</font>

1029
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:27,880
the use cases the line card performance

1030
00:43:24,529 --> 00:43:30,999
amount of prefixes and we can do an

1031
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:37,489
aggregation of prefix lists in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

1032
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:41,439
that we extend we aggregate prefix leads

1033
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:44,029
to minimal due to the amount of that

1034
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:48,619
line card support without degradation

1035
00:43:44,029 --> 00:43:51,710
right so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this white holes which</font>

1036
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:55,099
are not belong to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer but</font>

1037
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:59,089
covered by our prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> list after the</font>

1038
00:43:55,099 --> 00:44:01,249
aggregation but the result will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be still</font>

1039
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:04,400
much better than no prefix list at all

1040
00:44:01,249 --> 00:44:07,249
because the ways the address space was

1041
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:12,319
distributed between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> regions gives us</font>

1042
00:44:07,249 --> 00:44:15,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity to utilize this</font>

1043
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:17,070
distribution processes to leverage in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1044
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:22,080
our benefit

1045
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:24,240
so my estimates that only<font color="#E5E5E5"> around order</font>

1046
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:27,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">of magnitude less of foot traffic we</font>

1047
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,060
will go through this sparsely aggregated

1048
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:32,850
prefix lists we can also run a

1049
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:38,400
simulation but we direly need the data

1050
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:41,940
from vendors on the traffic line car

1051
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,830
performance and we also need lab

1052
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,600
expertise and so forth and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

1053
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:47,970
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> small company we don't have this</font>

00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hardware in our lab wait let me</font>

1055
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:52,140
interrupt for a minute also so there's I

1056
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:55,259
don't know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you aware of the</font>

1057
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:57,720
MIT spoofer project which was there was

1058
00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:00,030
actually Nanak talk about how it worked

1059
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,790
you know some of the caveats but it was

1060
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:05,490
one way to measure whether or not an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP</font>

1061
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:10,160
was or an entity was actually doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> anti</font>

1062
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:12,509
spoof filtering and they recently

1063
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,609
they've been lobbying to actually

1064
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:17,160
enhance that work and from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I've</font>

1065
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:18,750
heard is they will be doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and you</font>

1066
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:22,980
were in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other session the security</font>

1067
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:25,050
one Saudi kicks actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

1068

1069
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:29,790
also very interested in doing spoofing

1070
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,000
or anti spoofing rather and in the

1071
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:35,160
internet exchange world on Matthew lucky

1072
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,980
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the guy the researcher that's</font>

1073
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:41,250
working for kada I actually put him<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1074
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:43,620
in touch with your IX because he wanted

1075
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:46,290
to see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> he could work with internet</font>

1076
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:48,210
exchanges also to get measurements for

1077
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:50,790
anti spoofing and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were doing</font>

1078
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:52,410
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think your comment earlier is</font>

1079
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,210
right on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mark I mean I'm not</font>

1080
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:55,490
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> that believes in shaming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

1081
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,440
don't think that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right approach</font>

1082
00:45:55,490 --> 00:46:01,589
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think recognizing where anti</font>

1083
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,390
spoofing is done effectively and then

1084
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:05,970
also seeing what are the mechanisms that

1085
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:08,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">work because you know as ISPs you want</font>

1086
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:10,169
traffic to quote<font color="#CCCCCC"> from point A to point B</font>

1087
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:11,730
but you never ever want to block

1088
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:13,920
something that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be legitimate</font>

1089
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:16,230
traffic and so figuring that out

1090
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,330
building a document that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it'll</font>

1091
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:20,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a living document seeing what are the</font>

1092
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:21,700
different mechanisms that work in

1093
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,560
people's environments

1094
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:25,330
and something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people aren't always</font>

1095
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:29,170
aware of I mean I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone to the</font>

1096
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:31,450
idea for a very long time and this guy

1097
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:34,990
Pekka<font color="#CCCCCC"> scevola from Finland who actually</font>

1098
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:37,180
just recently got a legal degree he's

1099
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:39,339
now a lawyer which I find very cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1100
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:44,109
interesting but he had actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> written</font>

1101
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:46,060
a document that never became<font color="#E5E5E5"> a full RFC</font>

1102
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:49,120
but it's still in draft form out there

1103
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:53,110
and there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> bcp 84 which basically</font>

1104
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:56,440
looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> bc p38 but in a a similar</font>

1105
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:59,890
environment and so Pekka<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cibola actually</font>

1106
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:02,950
voted document on experiences with using

1107
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:05,049
bcp 84 and it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really relevant</font>

1108
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:07,750
document and so if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at how</font>

1109
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:09,940
to do anti spoofing and looking at you

1110
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:12,640
know how you do that via you r PF for

1111
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:16,480
any kind of filtering then that document

1112
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:19,990
is kind of a good read i think well it's

1113
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,510
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we as a community can</font>

1114
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:25,089
adopt policy no advertisement no service

1115
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:27,790
this means if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't see your prefixes</font>

1116
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:30,190
in advertisement you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me to</font>

1117
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:32,620
handle your outgoing traffic right and

1118
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:34,690
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just never gonna happen it's it's</font>

1119
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:38,200
standard practice in<font color="#CCCCCC"> d you should not</font>

1120
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:40,570
fight the society and its its current

1121
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:43,240
structure you should just adopt it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1122
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:44,920
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen yeah so</font>

1123
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:47,649
i said 'i hope that when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> document</font>

1124
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:49,750
the draft actually is advertised in in

1125
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:52,090
the be cop our mailing list that you

1126
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,980
will you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know comment on it and maybe</font>

1127
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:55,870
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on and out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

1128
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:59,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">use case if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have one that's not</font>

1129
00:47:55,870 --> 00:48:02,020
covered there but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know again I been</font>

1130
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,149
saying this for a long time however this

1131
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:06,400
has been on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my list for probably</font>

1132
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:08,290
two months<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because Barry green</font>

1133
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">offer also has offered to help and he</font>

1134
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:12,670
has a lot of experience I want the

1135
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:15,580
document to also go to him beforehand

1136
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:18,040
and then we send it out and and quite

1137
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:20,049
frankly one of my my concerns has been

1138
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:22,300
as I look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the other be cop documents</font>

1139
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:23,980
and talking to Barry we wanted to

1140
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,420
structure this one quite differently

1141
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,190
than the other ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have already</font>

1142
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:29,320
been

1143
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:31,390
because from our collective experience

1144
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,609
right at least understanding all the

1145
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:36,430
different technologies and just all the

1146
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:38,170
caveats well it'll be in a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

1147
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:42,940
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> different format but we hope it will</font>

1148
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:45,250
be useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and a last question you</font>

1149
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:49,300
said that you already<font color="#E5E5E5"> figured out how to</font>

1150
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:52,359
check this BCP 38 of all English

1151
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:55,150
children Europe EF enabled networks you

1152
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:57,160
have to generate the packet right and

1153
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:59,410
this packet have to have spoofed IP

1154
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:02,040
address so most of the sensor networks

1155
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:05,140
would not allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to do that because</font>

1156
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:09,609
it's legally<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey area right so it rises</font>

1157
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:12,580
next question if well my company does

1158
00:49:09,609 --> 00:49:15,520
research on bgp connectivity and we send

1159
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:18,880
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets in v4 and v6 address</font>

1160
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:21,640
space and we get all this attention from

1161
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:25,300
the crazy people but we also declare why

1162
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:28,750
we do that clearly and what we do too is

1163
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:31,180
that this this data doesn't fall in the

1164
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:33,670
wrong hands our verification process we

1165
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:37,270
stated clearly but still we still<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

1166
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:39,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of well a lot of critics and</font>

1167
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:46,410
probably we will get a lost<font color="#CCCCCC"> youths</font>

1168
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:51,099
coming so this question is if we do this

1169
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:53,410
scanning how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> work the legislation</font>

1170
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:55,720
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way that it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a grey any gray</font>

1171
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:59,049
area anymore if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a rischio because</font>

1172
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:01,419
bad guys will do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it anyway legal or not</font>

1173
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:03,430
legal say we'll do it anyway and we are

1174
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,619
the guys that stopping the bad guys so

1175
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:08,200
how we can move the legislation that

1176
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:10,180
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gray area anymore it is</font>

1177
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,098
Leslie I have absolutely no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea however</font>

1178
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:14,440
I would encourage you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in touch</font>

1179
00:50:12,099 --> 00:50:16,300
with Jared much because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he showed me</font>

1180
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,790
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interesting letters that he</font>

1181
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:22,119
got when he<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the Open DNS resolver</font>

1182
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:26,529
scans and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTP scans and yeah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1183
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:29,710
quite fascinating<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so um yeah but I</font>

1184
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:32,230
have no answer to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1185
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:34,560
follow-up letter thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice</font>

1186
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,560
discussion

1187
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:42,330
just a quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> point on that particular</font>

1188
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:44,510
topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> as there are there are some active</font>

1189
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:48,210
efforts for a slightly different kind of

1190
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:52,020
dcop which is being worked through the

1191
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:57,330
the IGF so you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a UN funded</font>

1192
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:59,850
open IGF ability to write things for

1193
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:02,580
businesses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and for governments and for</font>

1194
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:05,549
things like spurring economic growth and

1195
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:10,860
for educating our own local and regional

1196
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:12,210
governments so if you have if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1197
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,950
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put an effort for that kind</font>

1198
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:17,640
of thing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also help by starting</font>

1199
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:20,069
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write you know outlines for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vco p</font>

1200
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:22,350
group for the IGF as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1201
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:23,880
really focused on you know educating our

1202
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:29,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">governments not just that the technical</font>

1203
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:32,760
pieces well I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was my</font>

1204
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:38,160
citizenship times the proper person to

1205
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:42,150
do that however however however you can

1206
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:46,290
have my words that I will advocate for

1207
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:49,440
the practices on my local IGF with my

1208
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:51,720
government and it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like currently</font>

1209
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,910
we're in stage yes our government is

1210
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,609
heavy-handed but they realize that is

1211
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:59,339
not the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go on internet regulation</font>

1212
00:51:56,610 --> 00:52:04,820
so there is a actual living discussion

1213
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:04,820
goes on and it seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero listening</font>

1214
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:27,790
second laptops kind of sleep let's go

1215
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:28,960
back um so so that kind of concludes all

1216
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:32,310
of the documents going to talk about

1217
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,030
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as I let this back up here</font>

1218
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:35,140
when the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to talk</font>

1219
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:36,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">about before let go one of the things</font>

1220
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,920
we've been talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about among the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bc o</font>

1221
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:41,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">P Committee for quite a while now and</font>

1222
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,510
more and more so lately we're seeing you

1223
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:45,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">know obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a steady stream</font>

1224
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,630
of documents coming through but there's

1225
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,879
a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written</font>

1226
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:53,470
down I think there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1227
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:55,210
low-hanging fruit out there and what we

1228
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:57,549
really want to understand a little bit

1229
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:58,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">better is as engineers where I</font>

1230
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:01,090
understand the documentation is probably

1231
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,820
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> your favorite thing may even be</font>

1232
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:06,220
close to your least favorite thing to do

1233
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:08,920
so I'd really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like some input on you</font>

1234
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:10,569
know folks in this room two things one

1235
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,820
first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just make sure</font>

1236
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:15,760
that everyone here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably qualified</font>

1237
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:18,420
to contribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a bc o P the things</font>

1238
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,320
that you think are common sense are not

1239
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,550
the things you've been doing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

1240
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:24,460
the things you do every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your</font>

1241
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:26,770
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> are unique skills and unique</font>

1242
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:29,140
knowledge that the can and should be

1243
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">shared with other folks you know there's</font>

1244
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,089
DNS guys who don't know about routing

1245
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,819
those running guys who don't know about

1246
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:34,870
BMS and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all around and there's people in</font>

1247
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,460
the rest of the world we don't have the

1248
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:38,020
experience that some of the folks who

1249
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,610
have worked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies for 10 15 20</font>

1250
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:42,130
years here have or even a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

1251
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:43,900
years so first of all this is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1252
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:47,020
everyone and the second thing is how do

1253
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:49,060
I get you to come right more documents I

1254
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:51,190
think we're doing well we're movin along

1255
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:55,120
but there's a lot more so yeah I mean

1256
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:57,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally as prizes t-shirts names on</font>

1257
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,080
banners what you know are there things

1258
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:01,390
that would make this more appealing to

1259
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,400
you publishing them is rfcs at the at

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know I have an interest in</font>

you know a lot of this isn't just in

1302

excellent treadmills the other thing is

1307
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:58,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">I wanted to mention before we wrap up</font>

1308
00:55:56,299 --> 00:56:02,660
here that this isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just an an acting</font>

document lack nog and a frog boat have

1319
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:24,829
started efforts within those communities

1320
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:26,599
to and they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kind of you know</font>

1321
00:56:24,829 --> 00:56:28,700
followed along side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nog's and there's</font>

00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,900
Jan<font color="#CCCCCC"> AG and several others have kind of</font>

1326
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:40,970
taken on this effort to either work on

1327
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,250
documents actively or or also translate

1328
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:47,270
documents into their native language to

1329
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:49,160
help out with that then the next part of

1330
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:51,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is the ITF meeting is coming up in</font>

1331
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,480
Prague in end of june beginning to<font color="#CCCCCC"> July</font>

1332
00:56:51,829 --> 00:56:55,400
and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a meeting there</font>

1333
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:57,170
to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about kind of coordinating all</font>

1334
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,520
of those groups globally because

1335
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:01,309
hopefully this is the internet it should

1336
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:02,930
work pretty similarly most of the world

1337
00:57:01,309 --> 00:57:04,730
right so so documentary right here

1338
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:06,169
should be applicable in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Asia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a</font>

1339
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:09,559
document written in you know in Brazil

1340
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:11,599
should be applicable in in Germany but

1341
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:12,500
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do we you know publish those in</font>

1342
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,480
a way that everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows where they're</font>

1343
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,940
at and can coalesce on those so we're

1344
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,980
kind of working those details out you

1345
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:20,569
know working locally and then moving it

1346
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,099
up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it may be a secondary</font>

1347
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:25,190
committee<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be the members of</font>

1348
00:57:22,099 --> 00:57:28,849
committees at the regional level form a

1349
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:30,349
larger committee at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top things like</font>

1350
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:31,520
that may be publishing<font color="#CCCCCC"> mazhar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FCS all</font>

1351
00:57:30,349 --> 00:57:33,020
that so if you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1352
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,369
discussions as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and kind of the</font>

1353
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">logistics of how to put this whole thing</font>

1354
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:37,549
together at a global level and then

1355
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:39,618
create a global repository of documents

1356
00:57:37,549 --> 00:57:41,839
or at least you know maybe just a global

1357
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:43,339
pointers to the repositories that are

1358
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,420
local or how that all works out that's

1359
00:57:43,339 --> 00:57:46,400
another thing that we're interested in

1360
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:48,680
hearing more about and discussing either

1361
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:55,130
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially or or on the bc o</font>

1362
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:56,868
P list also and so there's all the links

1363
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:59,450
again most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just fed off of bc</font>

1364
00:57:56,869 --> 00:58:02,210
o pn org and the mailing list is bc o P

1365
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:02,819
at nine org which is a standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> mailman</font>

1366
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:05,490
list

1367
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:09,320
can join that if you'd like any<font color="#CCCCCC"> final</font>

1368
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:12,330
questions or comments before we wrap up

1369
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:14,280
if you found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this useful I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> highly</font>
