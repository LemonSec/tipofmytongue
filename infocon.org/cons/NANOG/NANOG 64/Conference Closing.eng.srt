pass the word we have four per meeting

182
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:54,630
so we didn't hit our total of four but

183
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,520
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> three is still great we had seven</font>

and talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about which I'm reporting here</font>

optional requested field at registration

194
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,030
today as it is registered attendees<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:30,329
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past three meetings the average</font>

196
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:36,390
was 68 so that gives you some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense of</font>

197
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:39,540
the gender demographics<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top</font>

198
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:42,780
countries represented on average<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

199
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:45,209
that the variety of countries here at

200
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:49,079
nana are about the same you still see

201
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:52,020
that the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States by far is is</font>

202
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:55,260
leading the way the interesting report

203
00:11:52,020 --> 00:12:01,730
for me is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the United Kingdom beat</font>

204
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:04,350
out Canada this time top organizations

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:12,480
that you're all here google<font color="#E5E5E5"> ntt</font>

Microsoft Cisco comcast facebook and

209
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Netflix this I added<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

210
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:22,140
information for you just because I

211
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:26,070
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know the usual nanog 64</font>

212
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:29,550
statistics is alphabetical enlisting I

213
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:32,280
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see by percentages and compare</font>

214
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:34,229
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reports to the average of</font>

215
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,449
the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> three meetings because I'm</font>

216
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:40,920
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked what's the demographic of</font>

217
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:44,070
your attendee who comes to nanog anyway

218
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,439
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

219
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,900
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a bit there were two hundred</font>

220
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,060
and twelve reported that they were from

221
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,590
internet service providers and when I

222
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">looked back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the average of the last</font>

223
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:58,140
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> meetings 159 reported that they</font>

224
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,910
were internet providers so that tells me

225
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:05,400
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still in an Internet organization</font>

226
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:07,920
network operators followed by a hundred

227
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">and seventy-four reported here today the</font>

228
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,430

229
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:17,070
102 equipment vendors 160 with the

230
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:19,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">average being 83 and then you can see</font>

231
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:22,290
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the arrest is the statistics so I</font>

232
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:25,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's fair</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that nanog is</font>

233
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:30,900
about internet operations when you agree

234
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:32,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so save the dates I always</font>
