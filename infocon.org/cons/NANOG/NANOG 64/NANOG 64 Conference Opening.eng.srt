nanog is an organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> run by</font>

00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:08,030
volunteers and a very very small

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,070
professional staff and those volunteers

38
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,340

about the attendee demographic what

carried over from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first days of the</font>

successful today that doesn't mean nanog

74
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:40,340
isn't evolving we're evolving quite a

75
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,149
bit we're constantly looking and

76
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:47,030
searching to make nanog more useful and

77
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,470
more important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the folks who come</font>

78
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,610
and attend and that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason I think</font>

79
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,920
you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that our program committee</font>

80
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:54,590
who has put together an incredibly great

81
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,989
program for us is really focusing on a

82
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,510
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> technology and a lot of</font>

83
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,580
the new advancements that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're all have</font>

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,798
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn to stay relevant and a rapidly</font>

changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> network landscape one other</font>

86
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,739
thing that's special about an a

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,810
non-conference is this as a

88
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:08,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">peer-reviewed program now one thing</font>

89
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,959
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see this morning is a</font>

90
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:13,150
lot of sponsors and we really appreciate

91
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,970
our sponsors our sponsors are your

92
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,949
employer's your vendors the people all

93
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,320
around us but one difference between an

94
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:22,180
ordinary conference and nanog is that

95
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,969
the sponsors don't control the program

96
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,550
here and I say this as someone who works

97
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,750
for one of the sponsors when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

98
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,330
the program that's put together by the

99
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:34,720
program committee there's no paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay</font>

100
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">for play here there's no control once</font>

101
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,530
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into one of these rooms</font>

102
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,750
everything sponsorship related except

103
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,549
for a brief thank you is absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

104
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:46,030
limits and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe we're one of the</font>

105
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,860
very few conferences in the country and

106
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,198
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the region regardless whether they</font>

107
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,910
say so or not we're one of the very few

108
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,250
that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that claim and it's</font>

109
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,510
absolutely one hundred percent true and

110
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,789
I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our program committee</font>

111
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,770
who zealously guards their independence

112
00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:02,669
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> who guards the integrity of nanog</font>

now so now exhibit has been around now

115
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,720
for almost 22 years and a career out of

116
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:15,699
the original<font color="#E5E5E5"> NSF regional tech meetings</font>

117
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,020
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past couple years we've been</font>

118
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:19,240
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a few things differently</font>

119
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,430
I'm so in addition to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the three time of</font>

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,659
year<font color="#CCCCCC"> fulminated conferences we also do</font>

121
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,909
what are called nanog on the road

122
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:28,030
conferences which are smaller events

123
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:29,500
held in smaller cities where we try to

124
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,388
get the local operator community

125
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,120
involved we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of this</font>

126
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:36,759
content from the larger conferences to

127
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,460
smaller venues weary typically a 50 to

128
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,919
100 attendees I urge folks attending

129
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,979
this conference to come to the nanog on

130
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,900
the road events both to bring content to

131
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:49,449
meet prospective engineers to do a

132

little<font color="#CCCCCC"> recruiting to socialize they're</font>

133
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:54,539
great events nana also is a strong

134
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:56,979
commitment to supporting new operators

135
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:59,259
when Sonia Naga is a membership

136
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:01,389

and when we listen to them what they

140
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,430
tell us their most significant concern

141
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,830
is is where do I find new network

142
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:13,479
engineers where do i find you know

143

people who are at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least as good as the</font>

00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,349
people i have now more of them and folks

145

who will understand a lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

146
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:21,279
technologies coming down the line so

147
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:23,380
nanog is an organization has a

they can learn a little bit about

164
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:59,409
carrier network engineering and so they

165
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:02,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">can sort of advanced in their coursework</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Netflix runs on the internet and and</font>

294
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,280
that kind of goes along with engineering

295
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,050
and ops and interconnection and

296
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,020
provisioning and hardware and software

297
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:36,689
and all the other related services that

298
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,030
are involved in our business that people

299
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,950
in this room and in the Nano community

300
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,319

basis you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when we see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ass and</font>

302
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,830
vine report that says<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netflix is roughly</font>

303
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,230
thirty seven percent of downstream

304
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,450
traffic for peak evening hours that's

305
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that resonates on a global</font>

306
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:58,230

like a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> webcasting icon on the</font>

526
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:52,049
archiving of the content many of the

527
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:54,059
other tracks will you know that happened

528
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:55,918
in other rooms some some tracks will

529
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:59,129
happen in this room there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font>

530
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,540
other rooms that that also contain

531
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:05,460
tracks we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get as much of it</font>

532
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:08,370
videotaped and archived as well even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

533
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:11,280
it's not webcast can't promise that

534
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:13,709
we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all but you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

535
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:17,309
that's the hope and the goal so be on

536
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:19,080
the lookout for that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just some</font>

537
00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:21,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">other program notes so there's a</font>

538
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">tutorial that's tomorrow there's there's</font>

539
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:25,380
two different slots basically there's a

540
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,990
930 and eleven o'clock slot with a break

541
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,929
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> between one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the tutorials runs</font>

542
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:33,600
through both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them which is the netops</font>

543
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:35,070
coding one so you'll see if you walk

544
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,570
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second part of that you'll</font>

545
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:40,770
maybe get the feeling that it's already

546
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:42,780
been going so that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is not to</font>

547
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:45,270
say that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but just just</font>

548
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,090
a heads up that if you want to learn

549
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:51,360
that part try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there for the the</font>

550
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:53,760
early session too and here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

551
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,070
departure this time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully won't</font>

552
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,360
catch too many people by surprise

553
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,189
there's the peering track so

554
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,360
traditionally nanog has had the thing

555
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,309
called peering track it used to be

556
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,699
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> bearing buff back in the days</font>

557
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:07,110
that bill<font color="#CCCCCC"> Norton started it and it had a</font>

558
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,580
variety of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things you know</font>

559
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:12,120
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were special interest to</font>

560
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,710
interconnection you know topics and then

561
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,120
how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing called peering personals</font>

562
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:17,730
so that that bill thought up where

563
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,469
people would at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope I'm giving</font>

564
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,600
bill the right credit or not taking it

565
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,570
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else where people</font>

566
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,000
would come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

567
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,549
about well I want to you know I'm from a

568
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,179
s whatever and this is where we have

569
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:33,039
presence and and and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer with us</font>

570
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:35,049
and so there was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> part and then</font>

571
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,389
there was what they called IX updates

572
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:39,399
where folks who operated in<font color="#CCCCCC"> her</font>

573
00:25:37,389 --> 00:25:41,580
connection points would come and talk

574
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:43,719
about things that they've done and new

575
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:48,189
capabilities that they've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> on offer</font>

576
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:52,330
so those you know over the many years of

577
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:55,059
nanog you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the focus of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

578
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:57,309
seemed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be kind of getting stale and</font>

579
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:59,799
also it seemed a bit promotional where

580
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:02,500
people were coming up and you know doing

581
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:04,600
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of presentation so what</font>

582
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,220
we did was we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went with something now</font>

583
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,459
called peering personals which is going

584
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:12,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">to happen today and there's a link on</font>

585
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:15,789
the website to<font color="#CCCCCC"> submit a form which</font>

586
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:18,250
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done in advance we may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

587
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:19,779
kind of full up at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point but like I</font>

588
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,720
said this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a this is a new thing so</font>

589
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:24,700
we're kind of getting used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and so</font>

590
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the peering personals will happen</font>

591
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:32,740
at 5pm today after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the general session</font>

592
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the first track block and and</font>

593
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:38,549
they'll be toward the end of the day but

594
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:41,860
before the netflix social and that is

595
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:44,230
programmed outside the purview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

596
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,029
program committee so if we do expect it

597
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,830
to be you know essentially somewhat

598
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:50,320
promotional where people come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

599
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:53,379
talk about their internet exchange or

600
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:56,710
they're from a s blonde they want to

601
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:59,740
connect with<font color="#E5E5E5"> other folks there'll be</font>

602
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:00,820
some refreshments there also so we'd

603
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,299
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to come to that there's also</font>

604
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:07,120
appearing track which will have non

605
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:10,389
promotional content as the goal and that

606
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,830
will be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> wednesday afternoon in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

607
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:12,908
earlier part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> afternoon where it</font>

608
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,259
had been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the later part of the</font>

609
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:15,639
afternoon so this is this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

610
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:17,559
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a change but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get people</font>

611
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:20,219
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> heads-up that we're splitting those</font>

612
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:22,418
things apart so the peering trap will be

613
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,509
topics related to inter connection but

614
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:28,540
but in a more traditional nanog non

615
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:31,120
promotional<font color="#E5E5E5"> vein so</font>

616
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:32,740
we've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things I</font>

617
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,530
had tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set this up as a slide that</font>

618
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:39,010
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of built incremental</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> e by the</font>

619
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:41,860
didn't work out so you know regulatory

620
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:43,840
always popular we have some of that this

621
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:48,550

624
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:55,090
we've got several talks about automation

625
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:56,500
in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the the coding tutorial</font>

626

that I talked about tomorrow there's a

627
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,670
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> other things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know that's</font>

00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:03,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously how topic ipv6 and its</font>

629
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:05,290
discontents you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever it's being</font>

630
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,909
rolled out and some experience with that

631
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:08,320
new architectures and technologies

632
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:11,140
particularly on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wednesday we have a</font>

633
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:15,070
number of talks that kind of clustered

634
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:17,470
their measurements is always a big topic

635
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:19,210
so there's that security there's a

636
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,610
security track but a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

637
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:24,630
talks about security three-letter word

638
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:31,510
starts with<font color="#CCCCCC"> s no it's not sex it's sdn</font>

639
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:33,490
and then you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of other stuff</font>

640
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,960
and obviously hopefully you've all had a

641
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:38,560
chance to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda and see</font>

642
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,310
what's on there just<font color="#E5E5E5"> some reminders so</font>

645
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:51,070
sponsored thing what we would ask though

646
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:53,620
is if you go out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that session during</font>

the time we r talks are going on please

649
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,310
try and be quiet or move just a little

650
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:03,490
further away because the doors open and

651
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:05,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">close and we get a lot of chatter and</font>

652
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:08,230
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> noise ins very distracting so</font>

00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:21,610
on the 32nd floor so that's the elevator

658
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:24,430
that hopefully will not have any more

659
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:28,959
outages and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will take you right to the</font>

microphones two microphones in each of

666
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:43,399
the aisles

667
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:46,250
forward and back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we'd like to</font>
