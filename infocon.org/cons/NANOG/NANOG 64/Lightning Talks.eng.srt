1
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,670
our next block is lightning talks so I'd

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,950
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three lightning talk authors to</font>

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,360
come up to the front I'll just remind

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">you that the order is going to be Jeff</font>

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,700
then Shelly and Jim as a quick

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,120
programming note lightning talks are<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,759
minute or less introductions to topic so

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,900
they may generate some questions but

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunately we don't have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,440
time to go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> detailed questions so I</font>

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,870
ask that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hold your questions and</font>

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,820
we'll give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the chance to catch up</font>

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the speakers afterwards here near</font>

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,880
the podium or perhaps at<font color="#CCCCCC"> buren gear so</font>

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:52,379
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> us rolling Jeff could you come up</font>

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:54,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about the DNS SEC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> root rock</font>

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,510
good morning old tin good afternoon all

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten minutes right this is all about how</font>

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,540
to kill the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet in two thousand</font>

20
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:07,110
bits no not really this is about some

21
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:10,800
impending moves around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS to change</font>

22
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:14,460
the trust anchors<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are used inside</font>

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:19,710
DNS SEC five years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> after much</font>

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:22,110
fanfare<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cans root signing service</font>

25
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,658
started in operation Grand ceremonies

26
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,549
all over the place lots of fanfare all

27
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,799
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden the root of the DNS was</font>

28
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,900
actually signed and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually</font>

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">allowed everyone else to use a single</font>

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,880
trust anchor to do validation it's all

31
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">very serious business the keys are held</font>

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,039
in some fantastic facilities somewhere

33
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,420
in the eastern hemisphere of this world

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,640
that's on the eastern side and of course

35
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,439
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> West Californians do things</font>

36
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,439
differently this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the repository there</font>

37
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:56,850
what is a key signing key what is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> KSK</font>

38
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,979
what we do in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DNS with with signing</font>

39
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,640
is actually split the whole problem into

40
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:05,759
two parts there is a key signing key

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,310
whose basic job is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign a zone</font>

42
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,410
signing key and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zone signing key</font>

43
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,620
signs the individual root zone entries

44
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,060
the zone signing<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys change I think</font>

45
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,130
it's every three months they get

46
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,799
regularly rolled and that happens

47
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,540
automatically because the key signing

48
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:25,290
key gives you constancy

49
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:30,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">ki signing key is the trust anchor and</font>

50
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:33,399
anyone who validates has a copy so if

51
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,730
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change the key all of you</font>

52
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,450
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change your copy and that's</font>

53
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,459
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a challenge so the</font>

54
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,560
private key stored inside some massively

55
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:48,730
secure HSN blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah it's all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,590
good no key lasts forever well that's

57
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,388
what we're told by the security folk So

58
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,980
You Know Who am I to argue with security

59
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:58,060
folk they're bigger than me and they'd

60
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:00,220
beat me up so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> years idea is at some</font>

61
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,260
point regularly you do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change</font>

62
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,439
over to different technologies in a

63
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,569
different key short keys over time I get

64
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:10,150
weaker cracking gets better we need

65
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:13,510
longer keys so the commitment was made

66
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:16,470
back in 2010 that we would roll the key

67
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:20,679
in five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was five years ago</font>

68
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:22,750
this is now it's time to change so the

69
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,790
cast of actors this strange mix of

70
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,340
politics and technology as you'd expect

71
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,948
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS we deliver on every front</font>

72
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,299
so not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only as I can involve but of</font>

73
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:33,639
course the US government through the

74
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:35,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">NTIA is involved and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of course verisign</font>

75
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:38,169
is involved and just to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> some fun</font>

76
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:40,930
folk like me are involved as external

77
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:45,190
design team they think it's a point of

78
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:47,470
sanity I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that's true so the</font>

79
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,090
approach we've been at this for some

80
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,728
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in looking at this there was an</font>

81
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,680
initial public consultation in 2012 a

82
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:55,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">detailed engineering study of the year</font>

83
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">after the security and stability</font>

84
00:03:55,569 --> 00:04:02,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">Advisory Committee put out a document in</font>

85
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:05,409
2013<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this year the KSK</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roll design</font>

86
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,268
team has been set up and here are them I

87
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:09,638
think I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> providing the entertainment to</font>

88
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:11,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> serious workers the rest of</font>

89
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:15,400
them have a long and<font color="#CCCCCC"> deep track history</font>

90
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,409
and the DNS I just measure things and of

91
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,180
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as that group the root</font>

92
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:22,270
zone management partners are also<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

93
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,880
providing advice assistance and material

94
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,299
so what have<font color="#CCCCCC"> we been doing well since</font>

95
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,610
January we've been studying discussing

96
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,039
pondering more pondering more pondering

97
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,729
bit more discussing more pondering you

98
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:38,870
sort of get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture</font>

99
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:41,210
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> June that's now we have to write</font>

100
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">a draft report and present it for I can</font>

101
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,739
public comment I should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> typing</font>

102
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,299
shouldn't I and in July after that

103
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,919
public comment will prepare a final

104
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,229
report and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then pass that through to the</font>

105
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:53,089
root zone management partners all very

106
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:58,039
good this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is bureaucracy at work it's</font>

107
00:04:53,089 --> 00:05:01,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">fantastic however underneath that is a</font>

108
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:04,240
serious issue because everyone has a

109
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:07,819
copy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that public key signing key</font>

110
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,979
everybody and everyone needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> load a</font>

111
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:12,800
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy now if you look at the</font>

112
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:15,620
ecosystem of the DNS out there and you

113
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,069
look at some resolver behaviors some

114
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,740
resolvers still are running on what I

115
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:24,229
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> are TRS 80 s there are some</font>

116
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,779
awfully old code out there and when you

117
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:28,849
start mucking around with trust anchors

118
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:30,979
and trying to get folk to reload things

119
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:32,779
this is sometimes getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to go</font>

120
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:35,058
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the Crypt and break open the</font>

121
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:36,889
seals to get a box<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just thought</font>

122
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:39,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">was running and you'd leave it alone and</font>

123
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:41,360
fiddle with it it's a recipe for

124
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">disaster and of course we've had some</font>

125
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,959
experience in rolling rolling keys

126
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:50,149
before 2010 the dear folk at the ripe

127
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,459
NCC every six month they rolled the key

128
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:56,749
every six month the traffic on their

129
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:59,029
resolvers sharply increased why because

130
00:05:56,749 --> 00:06:01,999
the linux distro was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending out old</font>

131
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:03,949
keys and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns resolvers being the</font>

132
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:06,289
obsessive-compulsive bits of software

133
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:08,930
they were at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time didn't like the</font>

134
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:11,659
idea of validation failure it just tried

135
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:14,419
and tried and tried and tried and tried

136
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:16,159
and tried and the Port Authority

137
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:19,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">nameservers going enough already can't</font>

138
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:21,080
you take a no since then obviously we've

139
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:23,659
learned so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more on we're so much</font>

140
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,149
better at this and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bits of</font>

141
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:29,629
magic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are relying on to make all</font>

142
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:33,949
this work is RFC 50 11 which is

143
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:37,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically old signs new so as long as</font>

144
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:44,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're doing RFC 50 11 in your resolvers</font>

145
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:44,709
this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> just work seriously</font>

146
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,969
must keep a straight face this will<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,890
work because what will happen is the old

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,440
key signing key will sign the new key

149
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,810
signing key your resolver will see this

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,460
store this new value as my trust anchor

152
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,620
we will move on and then at some point

153
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,960
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will publish a revocation of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

154
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,250

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,900
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going to work so what</font>

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,910
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> its take what you publish the first</font>

159
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,560
key now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets a little bit</font>

160
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:22,760
interesting because all of a sudden the

161
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:27,110
responses to your queries which were 736

162

octet since eyes jump to 1011 octet

163
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:34,040
since eyes interesting and then we start

164
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:37,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing the first of these the new KSK</font>

168
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:56,419
is 1297 that's bigger than 1280 v6 folk

169
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:59,210
that's bigger which does mean there

170
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,220
might be some issues around there we run

171
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,700
the two for a while we remove the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old</font>

172
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:07,700
KSK but don't revoke it there is still a

00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,190
we're sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've actually managed</font>

firstly some numbers you know if these

six was like this would all be you know

201

retired and finished it is amazing how

202
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,089
much DNS SEC is out there almost

207
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,339
bit as soon as you sign a zone everyone

00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:54,879
loves your signature almost everyone

209
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:57,339

to simply go our stuff this security

220
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:27,519
business I really want the answer some

00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,930
literally means remote data dated at a

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,509
distance and we were talking about data

244
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:36,609
about your network infrastructure it is

245
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:39,309
by definition telemetry because there is

246
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:41,680
a gap between where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is sensed</font>

these are emergent principles really

338
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:15,060
first of all that we must enable a push

339
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:17,490
mechanism for telemetry from our network

340
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:20,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know it's useful just to</font>

341
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,920
eliminate the polling cycle of an SNMP

342
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,720
yet first of all that's very useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

in and of itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> but one thing we</font>

understand as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as that telemetry</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> SNMP started to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up when we went</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to high frequency polling of a large</font>

00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:31,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">about performance then you've lost the</font>

372
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,760
value of streaming telemetry finally and

373
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,069
and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> most importantly is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

374
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,050
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be flexible and adapt this data</font>

375

to the existing tool chains right this

376
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:41,670
means that the format must be<font color="#CCCCCC"> flexible</font>

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:44,550
the transport must be<font color="#CCCCCC"> flexible I mean</font>

381
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:54,000
the next 20 years I mean that's insane

382
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,790
right given the speed at which tools are

383
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,680
evolving around big data analytics but

384
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,649
that's exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did it with SNMP</font>

and a better way of looking at is

probably the line in red which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and difficult to figure out but at least</font>

428
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,550
you have a specific name for the data

429
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get how do we do that</font>

430
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,960
if we move away from SMP as a model<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

431
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,310
I think we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some talks tomorrow</font>

432
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,820
that will give us some ideas about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

433
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:46,050
but it's an area open for discussion

434
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,389
another area would be around flow

435
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:50,669
control with streaming do we just assume

436
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:53,150
that the receiver<font color="#CCCCCC"> has infinite capacity</font>

437
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:56,220
or do we need some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of swell CH</font>

438
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:58,500
mechanism in there to stop the<font color="#CCCCCC"> flow do</font>

439
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,660
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do filtering on the device do</font>

440
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,550
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do aggregation do we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

441
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,970
calculate<font color="#E5E5E5"> Delta's instead of sending</font>

442
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:07,649
absolute values you know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> our open</font>

443
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,330
questions I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what we do on</font>

444
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,940
the box and then what we do off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box</font>

445
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,860
at the receiver there's a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

446
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,600
around what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the ideal frequency I</font>

447
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,689
think some people would be absolutely

448
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,580
thrilled if we could give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them every</font>

449
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,890
statistic they want it every 60 seconds

450
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,080
you know that's a that's a challenge for

451
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:27,060
SP in some some use cases so if we could

452
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to 60 seconds a lot of people would</font>

453
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,510
say that's a win today but what about

454
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,419
two years from now or five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

455
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:35,370
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 10 years from now how should we</font>

456
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,110
be streaming this data off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box at</font>

457
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,300
what point also<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it get ridiculous</font>

458
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,520
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean if we're doing millisecond</font>

459
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:44,220
streaming of statistics on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box you</font>

460
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,740
know is that too much do we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

461
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,330
know find a different way of solving

462
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,760
that problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not use streaming</font>

463
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,050
telemetry as a hammer the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

464
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,610
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about turning on the</font>

465
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:56,430
faucet you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know giving that device</font>

466
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,290
instructions on what you want you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

467
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,960
that statically but eventually we need

468
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,700
to move<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a dynamic way of publishing</font>

469
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,889
and subscribe

470
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,870
the capabilities of the box so these are

471
00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:09,168
still things that that need to be worked

472
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:11,809
out finally they're the unknown unknowns

473
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:13,429
right and this is potentially much

474
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:15,710
bigger than<font color="#E5E5E5"> either of the other two</font>

475
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:17,179
categories and all I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say about</font>

476
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,070
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the way that we're going to</font>

477
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:21,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">learn these things is through</font>

478
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:23,899
experimentation it's through getting

479
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,820
code in the lab<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know getting the</font>

480
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:27,559
data off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box interfacing it with</font>

481
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">open source tools and so on and so forth</font>

482
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:33,110
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this will be a and has been</font>

483
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,549
so far a very iterative process and it's

484
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:38,000
one that we you know proceed through

485
00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:39,649
stages so the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like you</font>

486
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,450
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from here is that you know</font>

487
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:43,370
we believe that streaming utility

488
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,019
streaming telemetry has utility and

489
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,699
traction there's interest in this

490
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:48,679
there's a lot of conversations going on

491
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,779
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but it's still a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very young</font>

492
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:53,000
technology and so there's an opportunity

493
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:54,799
for you guys to have an influence to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

494
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,690
know put in your pet<font color="#E5E5E5"> peeves and things</font>

495
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,340
you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to see and we can have a</font>

496
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:01,090
discussion so I hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts today</font>

497
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,090
thank

498
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:13,540
hi I'm Jim Martin I'm with ISC and I

499
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,700
won't talk a little bit about Dale v d

500
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,879
lv is d in a sec look aside validation

501
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,980
it is a mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was developed</font>

502
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,890
early in the life of<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMS second around</font>

503
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:26,290
200 to 2,000<font color="#CCCCCC"> six with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the objective of</font>

504
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:29,770
trying to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the chicken and egg</font>

505
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:33,040
problem of not having the tree signed up

506
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:35,590
to the roof it was a repository<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all</font>

507
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,178
of the key information that was off to

508
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:39,699
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> side and had its own separate trust</font>

509
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:41,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">anger it was a great idea at the time</font>

510
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,170
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has served its purpose for many</font>

511
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,900
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> but a bunch of things have</font>

512
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:49,420
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> since then we started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with when</font>

513
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,670
it started there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> one ccTLD that was</font>

514
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,460
signed the dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> SC guys but since then</font>

515
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,740
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a huge number of ccTLDs we've</font>

516
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,740
had the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root finally get signed we've</font>

517
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:02,710
had the we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of the</font>

518
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:05,590
original<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds comm net all of those guys</font>

519
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:08,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">signed and we also have had a lot of the</font>

520
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:11,080
recursive resolvers have become a DNS

521
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,720
SEC enabled and we're to the point where

522
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,428
we've got quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few of all the</font>

523
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,580
infrastructure pieces in but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

524
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:22,420
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the LD around so let us the</font>

525
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,949
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> of are we doing a benefit for</font>

526
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,429
the internet anymore by running this

527
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,830
repository the advantages<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having it</font>

528
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:33,010
around is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if your parent isn't</font>

529
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:36,189
signed it still works and it doesn't

530
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:39,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost you anything and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is all fully</font>

531
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:41,679
deployed at this point but it was

532
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,990
reducing the pressure on the few

533
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,720
remaining TL DS that aren't signed to

534
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,880
sign and it reduces the pressure on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

535
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,110
registrar's to accept the d/s records

536
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,540
there because well you know you still

537
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">can go over there and frankly there's</font>

538
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,260
some additional work that the resolvers

539
00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:01,150
are having to do by going off to the to

540
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:04,240
the d lv entry so we're looking at who

541
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:07,540
really still needs it so who needs it

542
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,490
are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people whose parents are not</font>

543
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:13,270
signed the zones whose parents are not

544
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:14,800
signed and the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who have</font>

545
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:17,650
registrar's who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the ability</font>

546
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to accept d a second's so let's look at</font>

547
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,080
those

548
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,159
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at if you look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the graph</font>

549
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,500
it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear that the uptake of</font>

550
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:28,269
signing of TL DS is going up

551
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,789
dramatically we've got more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a three</font>

552
00:23:28,269 --> 00:23:32,710
quarter of them signed at this point and

553
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:34,539
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no indication that there's going</font>

554
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:38,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a big problem getting the last one</font>

555
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:40,120
signed and also on the Registrar side

556
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:43,539
again a very large percentage of the

557
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,580
registrar's support<font color="#CCCCCC"> des records but for</font>

558
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:46,990
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> who do not currently obviously</font>

559
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,610
have it through the web interface many

560
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,519
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> still accept it through an email</font>

561
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:54,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if anybody who's resigning with</font>

00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">ICANN the new registrar accreditation</font>

563
00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:59,949
agreements require that you accept this

564
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:02,470
information so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal v weren't around</font>

565
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,269
it would require some people to switch

566
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,940
registrar's if they want to continue

checklist we said the route signed we've

570

got a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the tail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deezer</font>

594
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:23,409
we're going to work on cleaning that

stuff up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then eventually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll stop</font>

adding new zones and eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

597
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:30,908
remove them all and here's the timeline

00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:31,750
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> planning on working on so</font>

599
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:32,980
today we

600
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,690
in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of weeks we're going</font>

601
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,030
to be we're sending out some emails to

602
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:40,840
people who are in the d lv right now so

603
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,980
if your zone is already valla dia<font color="#CCCCCC"> bilal</font>

the way up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the route everything's</font>

605
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:48,430
good we're asking people to remove their

606
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:50,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">zones out of the d lv then also if you</font>

607
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:52,450
could potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> be validated up to the</font>

608
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,820
route but you just haven't given your

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,280
information to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your registrar yet we're</font>

610
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:59,320
asking you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do that as well this is</font>

611
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,210
all just a request at this point no

612
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,669
changes are being made to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

infrastructure at this point at the

accepting registrations for zones that

could be validated outside of the day

617
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:16,360
lovie just don't want to have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

618
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:18,129
contributions to the problem in the

middle of 2016 about a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

620
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:22,990
we're saying that no new users and no

new zones can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> registered in the d lv</font>

622
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:28,540
and anybody who we warned in this email

623
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're about to send send out that</font>

624
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:33,159
is going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> away we're going to purge</font>

625
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:35,620
those records and then ultimately at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning of 2017 we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> purge</font>

00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:45,880
stick<font color="#CCCCCC"> around for forever or for our</font>

630

by beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 2017 that the dl via is</font>

633
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,710
going to be gone the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I'm</font>

634
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,480
here is to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

635
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:01,720
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happening and</font>

636
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,640
that if there is push back if people

637
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,350
believe this is a bad idea we want to

638
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,470
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it now rather than later in</font>

639
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:13,050
the game so if you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any questions</font>

640
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:15,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">or comments please email to dl viic org</font>

641
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:18,720
or ask questions now but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you're</font>

642
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:21,720
far more likely to go when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a beer</font>

643
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank</font>

644

all right I did ask the<font color="#CCCCCC"> speakers just to</font>

645
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:35,460
wait around for a few minutes so if you

646
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:38,158
do have any questions when I finish

647
