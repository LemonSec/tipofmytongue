1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,290
now I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to introduce</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sreekanth</font>

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:14,180
Thunder racin who is here and going to

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:18,590
talk about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> measurements studies</font>

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:22,790
that is done hey and there's clicker

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:29,320
here and this is related in Y so this

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:34,160
forward back no not for it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:37,790
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> um Bonnie thanks for having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me over</font>

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,830
at nano to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my research so I'm</font>

9
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,810
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about a recent work on</font>

10
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,580
trying to understand bottlenecks

11
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,500
throughput bottlenecks in Los in the

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,349
last mile so specifically we<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked</font>

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,690
whether it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to identify</font>

14
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:53,570
throughput bottlenecks to either your

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">access link or your wireless network so</font>

16
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,960
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> stray concentration I am a</font>

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,190
postdoctoral researcher at the

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,710
International Computer Science Institute

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,420
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bay in Berkeley and this is</font>

20
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:06,909
joint work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick feemster at</font>

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:09,469
Princeton and an R dr. Shara at inria so

22
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:11,780
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure most of us here in this room</font>

23
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:14,658
have grappled with the whole network at

24
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:18,380
some point you know trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

25
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:21,679
why a video stalled or your wife called

26
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,600
halted and in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> struggle to figure out</font>

27
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:24,979
why why that happened so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,919
reasons why it's so difficult to

29
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:30,710
understand is that well there are many

30
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">sources of problems you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know in the last</font>

31
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,509
mile you could have congestion in your

32
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:37,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">ISP you could have wireless issues you</font>

33
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:40,819
could have any client issues you know

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,670
poor OS or you know that hardware or

35
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:45,859
even beyond the last mile you could have

36
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,990
peering issues in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes between ISPs</font>

37
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:52,999
and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> server side issues in a poorly</font>

38
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:54,619
designed application what not um so you

39
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:56,359
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we focus on the last mile in this</font>

40
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:58,399
work and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked so how can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

41
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:00,919
determine whether there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bottleneck</font>

42
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,889
in the last mile and if there is whether

43
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,429
it's the home wireless network or the

44
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:09,530
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> link that's causing the problem</font>

45
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:11,000
so well you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of multiple ways</font>

46
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,130
in which you can try to approach this

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,010
problem you could think about

48
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:18,859
instrumenting<font color="#CCCCCC"> end hosts your servers if</font>

49
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,920
you're an application provider or

50
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,690
our clients inside the home network but

51
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,959
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem there is that you know end</font>

52
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:30,440
hosts generally don't have sufficient

53
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,820
visibility into the end-to-end path so

54
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,220
you didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> global view and</font>

55
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,500
although you can sort of identify the

56
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,180
presence of a bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's it's very</font>

57
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,850
difficult to identify the location

58
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,020
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of difficult to infer</font>

59
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:45,739
properties of the network beyond a

60
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:48,650
single hop or two for example even if

61
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're on your laptop you know you can't</font>

62
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">see traffic that goes to other devices</font>

63
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,620
inside your home network or if you're an

64
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,240
application provider it's difficult to

65
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,370
know what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on beyond your</font>

66
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:03,320
immediate network so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gateway</font>

67
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,420
conveniently sits right between the two

68
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,700
networks that were interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

69
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,869
access link and the wireless link and it

70
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:15,170
has visibility into both these networks

71
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so well how do we go about you know</font>

72
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,470
approaching this problem from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

73
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:20,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">gateway so there are two broad classes</font>

74
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,859
of techniques that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could use you</font>

75
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,040
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could use active measurements</font>

76
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,930
and we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FCC has</font>

77
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,070
they're measuring broadband<font color="#E5E5E5"> America</font>

78
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,709
plant where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're running active</font>

79
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,060
measurements from home gateways the

80
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,799
problem there is that even though it

81
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,709
gives us a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of insight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

82
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,870
access link these measurements do not

83
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,700
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean much per se for the user</font>

84
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,790
when they are struggling with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

85
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,230
in an immediate problem and because

86
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,019
they're active measurements they don't

87
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,488
<font color="#E5E5E5">really represent the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> performance user</font>

88
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">see when they are you know running an</font>

89
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:54,140
application and another<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

90
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:57,470
you know most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us use the wireless</font>

91
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:00,440
network and wireless conditions vary a

92
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,299
lot in even across a few seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

93
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">could have so much variation in said</font>

94
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:05,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">wireless network that an active</font>

95
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,709
measurement doesn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

96
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,170
even if you can run an active

97
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:11,830
measurement on the wireless<font color="#CCCCCC"> network so</font>

98
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">we really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be measuring passively</font>

99
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,150
so that you know any inference that we

100
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:23,360
make actually represents user traffic

101
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:24,919
and also enter and traffic so well what

102
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,530
metrics can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used from the gateway</font>

103
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:31,370
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can help us answer this question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

104
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,479
we use a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple intuition based on</font>

105
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,550
how bottle

106
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,980
like buffers work well the intuition is

107
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,320
that packets get buffered at the bottle

108
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:41,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">I click well here's a simple</font>

109
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,659
illustration of how a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottleneck link</font>

110
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:47,690
works you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets coming in from a</font>

111
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,640
non bottleneck link at a rate<font color="#E5E5E5"> faster</font>

112
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,250
than the bottleneck link can handle and

113
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,320
so the packets build up at the head of

114
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,060
the bottleneck link and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

115
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,430
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happens in that you know the</font>

116
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,590
bottleneck link actually shapes traffic

117
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,750
you know it had it gets more packets

118
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:05,090
than it can handle but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it handles these</font>

119
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,880
packets at a very specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

120
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:11,299
its capacity so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two</font>

121
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,250
interesting things you can get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

122
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,440
this depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on where you're observing</font>

123
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the traffic from assuming that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

124
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,700
downstream of the bottleneck link well

125
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,880
in the in our case I mean you're at the

126
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:26,599
home<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the bottleneck link is the ISPs</font>

127
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,790
access length so you see that packets

128
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,370
that are shaped steadily you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

129
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,350
you see the shaped packets and you

130
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:37,970
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see them in the form of steady</font>

131
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:40,940
packet arrivals supposing the bottleneck

132
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,260
link were at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wireless network that</font>

133
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,370
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your vantage point has</font>

134
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,990
shipped ready when they are at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

135
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,150
point the home the wireless gateway

136
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're now at the head of the bottleneck</font>

137
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,890
link and you can actually see the buffer

138
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,890
building up and you can actually see an

139
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:58,219
increase in in latency because of the

140
00:05:54,890 --> 00:06:02,510
buffer but the buffer building up so we

141
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:04,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually use these two intuitions to in</font>

142
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:07,580
order to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a detection let's go a</font>

143
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,860
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit deeper into both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these so</font>

144
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,690
here's an experiment under very

145
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,970
controlled settings that actually shows

146
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,680
the case where the access link is not

147
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bottleneck it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the wireless that's</font>

148
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,320
a bottleneck so the x-axis shows time

149
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,480
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> y-axis shows instantaneous</font>

150
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:29,180
throughput at<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 millisecond intervals</font>

151
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:31,010
and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an 82 to 11g network so</font>

152
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,040
you can see that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> throughput actually</font>

153
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:38,210
hovers around the 25 megabit per second

154
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,560
mark and what you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is TCPS</font>

155
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,150
congestion control at work it's

156
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,220
constantly trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out the best</font>

157
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,750
rate at which just sent and there's a

158
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,840
lot of variation and this is what you

159
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,419
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font>

160
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,940
now if you flip the network so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

161
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:52,590
access link is the bottleneck you know

162
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,930
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that by because we control</font>

163
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,150
it change it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say three megabit per</font>

164
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,370
second and have the observation point

165
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,739
the same we see something entirely

166
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,460
different we see the shaped packets and

167
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:07,680
we see very little variation in packet

168
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,690
in the instantaneous throughput right

169
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,180
that's because the bottleneck link has

170
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:16,169
completely smoothed away any evidence of

171
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:19,639
TCPS congestion control and how do we

172
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:21,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">know these are very two distinct</font>

173
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,150
properties but you know and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

174
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,859
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure these by looking at the</font>

175
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,380
coefficient of variation of packet

176
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,110
interval x coefficient of variation is

177
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:35,669
simply the standard deviation normalized

178
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:38,580
by the the mean so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first case the</font>

179
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:41,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">cv parameter is about point 88 in this</font>

180
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:54,139
example in the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> case it's about</font>

181
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:56,639
0.005% through a bottleneck link or not

182
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:59,010
so basically the packets that<font color="#E5E5E5"> arrive</font>

183
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,690
after a bottleneck<font color="#E5E5E5"> link have really low</font>

184
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:03,180
coefficient of variation of packet in

185
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,130
tribal times let's look at the second

186
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,780
intuition here's a similar set of

187
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,560
experiments you know but over a much

188
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:13,770
larger run a few dozen runs so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

189
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">showing on the x-axis achieved through</font>

190
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:21,090
put over a similar network and on the

191
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:23,520
y-axis I'm showing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTD over TCP but</font>

192
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:25,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">between the Gateway and the client</font>

193
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,090
inside the wireless network so this is

194
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,979
not the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end RTD because we</font>

195
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:31,080
observed traffic at the gateway we can

196
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually split the RTD between the</font>

197
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">Gateway and the client and the Gateway</font>

198
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:39,630
and the server so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rtt inside</font>

199
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:42,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> land network so what we see here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

200
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,939
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would expect that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp RTD</font>

201
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,589
the average TCR TD is about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5</font>

202
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">milliseconds it's slightly higher than</font>

203
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:51,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you might normally expect you</font>

204
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:54,480
would expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> millisecond but you</font>

205
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,520
know still within reason but if you flip

206
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,050
it and make the wireless the bottlenecks

207
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,180
are basically remove the access link

208
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,550
bottle like

209
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:04,910
the picture changes again so you see a

210
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:08,150
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> distinct property the wireless RTT</font>

211
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:10,189
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTD over wireless has changed as</font>

212
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:13,300
increased to about 25 to 30 milliseconds

213
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:17,000
so this is because of buffering inside

214
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:21,170
the wireless gateway and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> again we can</font>

215
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,660
use this very distinct property the line

216
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">rtt in order to detect whether the</font>

217
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,600
wireless has bottle net the end-to-end

218
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:31,460
flow or not so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> put these two</font>

219
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,210
properties together in order to build a

220
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:37,610
very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> threshold based algorithm</font>

221
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:39,830
that runs on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Gateway so we first</font>

222
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,990
collect packet races and we check<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

223
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,000
if we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough packets to even start</font>

224
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,620
making a decision I mean if there are

225
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,180
not enough packets is no point in

226
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,570
running this algorithm so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say</font>

227
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,370
hey that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough demand if there is</font>

228
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,470
if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are enough packets then we</font>

229
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,840
compute the coefficient of variation of

230
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,870
packet inter arrival times and then we

231
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:02,570
check to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if it's you know if it</font>

232
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">falls below a threshold if it does then</font>

233
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:08,570
well the access link is the bottom leg

234
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:10,930
and if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't know the access link</font>

235
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:14,990
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the bottleneck so we detect so we</font>

236
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:17,239
check<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see what the land rtt is and if</font>

237
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's exceeds a threshold then we say</font>

238
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the wireless link is the bottleneck</font>

239
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,840
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't then we say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font>

240
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">is no last smile bottle like this is</font>

241
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,420
important because well you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

242
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,640
sufficient flow rate but you'd need not

243
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,729
have a bottleneck in the last mile and

244
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:38,180
it happened due to multiple reasons the

245
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:40,010
the interent path could be too large or

246
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,370
you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be packet loss that</font>

247
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">tcp never really scales up to the rate</font>

248
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,350
of the bottleneck link or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

249
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:52,130
application demand doesn't really need

250
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:55,730
DCP to scale up or be too<font color="#E5E5E5"> short so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

251
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:57,200
could be multiple reasons why you know

252
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:03,640
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no last night button like even</font>

253
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:06,290
though there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is traffic so this is our</font>

254
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,090
technique it's very simple its threshold

255
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,360
basement is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> canter and slight</font>

256
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,960
weight enough to run on a home gateway

257
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,760
so we actually evaluated this

258
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,120
in a controlled setting in a lab with

259
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,280
using you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of different types</font>

260
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,800
of access link through boots you know

261
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,439
different wireless conditions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

262
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">tested different thresholds with our</font>

263
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,320
devices and we saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were able to</font>

264
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,440
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> really high detection accuracy with</font>

265
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,360
simple thresholds<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a CB</font>

266
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,550
parameter of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 point eight and a tao of</font>

267
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">15 milliseconds and in this case i'll in</font>

268
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:44,000
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me let me clarify that the the first</font>

269
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:47,040
threshold for coefficient of variation

270
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,770
should work across any platform that you

271
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,870
choose but for for the tower parameter

272
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:54,780
for the land<font color="#CCCCCC"> rtt it really depends on</font>

273
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:58,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hardware that are using so we used a</font>

274
00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:01,770
netgear<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3800 home wireless router and</font>

275
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:05,460
for that the 50 millisecond threshold

276
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:08,400
works really well so we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> built a</font>

277
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:10,560
prototype system it collects Pee caps on

278
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,020
the device it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> look into the</font>

279
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,089
payload at all we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care we only</font>

280
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,620
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the tcp/ip headers and even then</font>

281
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,120
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care you know what the</font>

282
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,520
actual addresses are we just care about

283
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,380
individual flows so we completely

284
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,010
anonymize all of these on the device

285
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,960
using a per-device<font color="#E5E5E5"> per run salt and</font>

286
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:30,390
these gateways are really resource

287
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,360

few megs of available storage and not a

289

292

collect some meta information like the

296
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,710
we collect this data about three times

it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really change whether they</font>

338
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,450
conflates both the access link and the

339
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,430
wireless link bottlenecks so if you

340
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:56,610
split them out when we see start seeing

341
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:59,670
more interesting results so this graph

to see whether it's an access link or a

345

wireless bottom leg and we see here that

00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,920
when users have throughput less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

it's more the wireless link that starts

bottom liking them and you know it

362

really dominates about<font color="#CCCCCC"> eighty twenty as</font>

00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:52,850
as soon as you exceed 20 megabits per

364
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:55,369
second which is surprising because all

of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of these devices around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 82</font>

right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> says 300 but you know</font>

over<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP and you know if you assume in</font>

371
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:11,118
all the problems that wireless networks

372
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:15,350
come with you would get at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 to</font>

373
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:16,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">60 not as low as in a 20 to 30 I mean</font>

374
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:20,839
that's that's what you would expect in a

375
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:22,879
in an 802 11 g network so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font>

376
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,939
surprising that you know we talked about

377
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">the need to have in a faster broadband</font>

378
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:30,410
speeds but users are getting really

379
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:33,889
users<font color="#CCCCCC"> are having poor wireless networks</font>

380
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:36,399
in their homes so one of the potential

381
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:39,049
reasons why this could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the case is</font>

382
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,239
2.4 gigahertz we couldn't really

383
00:16:39,049 --> 00:16:42,589
validate this in the FCC deployment but

384
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:44,389
we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to validate this in the</font>

385
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:47,149
pilot bismarck deployment why we had

386
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:51,139
both 2.4 and or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 gigahertz radio on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

387
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:53,949
same device and we saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

388
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:57,369
devices that used<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 gigahertz</font>

389
00:16:53,949 --> 00:17:01,910
consistently got higher throughput than

390
00:16:57,369 --> 00:17:04,549
devices that use 2.4 gigahertz and you

391
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:06,619
know when we looked into the wireless

392
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:08,629
frames we also saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the 5 gigahertz</font>

393
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:10,489
channel has consistently higher bit

394
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,990
rates and also lower heat transmission

395
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,000
rates and you know there could be

396
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,970
multiple reasons why this could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

397
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,699
case 2.4 gigahertz is typically more

398
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,889
congested it's also in affected by non

399
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:24,559
802 11 devices like you know baby

400
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:26,928
monitors or you know cordless phones so

401
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 gigahertz channel is cleaner</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

402
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:30,590
don't know if it's systemic I mean if it

403
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,360
starts getting more popular you could

404
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,059
start seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more problems in fact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

405
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,668
hurts as well but you know right now we

406
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:41,289
see that the fabulous channel performs

407
00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:45,440
way better than 2.4 gigahertz channel

408
00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:47,240
well moving on so what sort of

409
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,559
throughputs to users get when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

410
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">accessing for tonight so so this result</font>

411
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:55,040
shows

412
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:58,130
well when we detect an access important

413
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,420
like how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it compare to the capacity</font>

414
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,180
of their access link and we know that

415
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:04,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said we have independent</font>

416
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,080
measurements of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the capacity you did not</font>

417
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:09,560
match what they are actually paying for

418
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,889
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know from previous MBA reports</font>

419
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,169
that users at least in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US get really</font>

420
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:18,530
consistent performances from there from

421
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:20,210
there is be so what we see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when</font>

422
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,580
we detect an access link bottom like we

423
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:26,680
normalize it by the capacity measurement

424
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:30,230
from that user and we see that users

425
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:33,050
throughput the passive usage throughput

426
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:35,420
actually matches very closely with their

427
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:37,399
measured capacity so there's also

428
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:39,050
independently sort of validates our

429
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,700
algorithm you know we can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hey</font>

430
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,770
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we detect an access link</font>

431
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:46,430

459
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:59,420

a property of cues that make it in a

467
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:20,820
deploying this tool please let us know

468
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,669
so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion I presented you know</font>

469
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,560
Homer axis which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lightweight and</font>

470
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,840
accurate system to locate last mile

471
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:31,080
downstream throughput bottlenecks we

472
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,570
deployed this in two large deployments

473
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,189
in resource-constrained gateways so yes

474
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,929
this actually works even in home

475
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,970
gateways and we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for further</font>

476
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,650
deployments and we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> had some</font>

477
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:43,440
really interesting results which we are

478
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:45,180
still digging into at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least initially we</font>

479
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,550
see that access link bottlenecks are

480
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,710
only common when throughput you know is

481
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,240
less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 20 megabits per second</font>

482
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,520
and beyond that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty much almost</font>

483
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:58,260
always the wireless<font color="#CCCCCC"> said bottlenecks</font>

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,760
performance please you know if contact

486
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,960
you're interested in deploying it if

487
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:11,070
you'd like a demo and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm happy to take</font>

488
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:14,670
questions now<font color="#CCCCCC"> good morning my name is</font>

489
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:17,370
Joel<font color="#CCCCCC"> our Wikipedia i'm wondering if you</font>

490
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:19,320
try to correlate client a signal

491
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,610
strength and maybe throw out<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients</font>

492
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,720
that had<font color="#CCCCCC"> very poor so they won't</font>

493
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,360
strength while they're on the Wi-Fi

494
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,370
everybody roams out of there good Wi-Fi

495
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,669
range and obviously you'll have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

496
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:32,610
less performance in that condition um so

497
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:34,830
we don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> any wireless metrics in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

498
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:37,429
FCC deployment but we do have signal

499
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:41,189
strength in the smaller pilot deployment

500
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:42,660
well you could deal with the two ways

501
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,550
yes you could throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> out users that have</font>

502
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,900
low signal strength but you know the

503
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:47,970
fact that they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the</font>

504
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,560
network when they have low signal

505
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,600
strength means that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

506
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,310
get something out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

507
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,929
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to see that they are</font>

508

509
00:21:54,930 --> 00:22:00,900
users may not know that they have low

00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:02,820
signal strength<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my point was</font>

511
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,970
that you're gonna have a with my house I

512
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:06,090
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> devices</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">name is John Brazil scheme comcast so it</font>

516
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,139
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you've got a pretty good way</font>

517
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:19,000
to determine<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've got media issues</font>

518
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,310
in the home from client to a router and

519
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,230
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the router to network so i</font>

520
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:25,419
won't kind of defer my question maybe

521
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:28,630
for for later on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that front question i</font>

522
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:31,960
have for you is do you factor in v4

523
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:34,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">versus v6 into your methodology and do</font>

524
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,180
you factor in the presence of a category

525
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,459
net inside of your network as well as

526
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:42,220
part of this methodology um so our

527
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:45,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">techniques should be shouldn't be</font>

528
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,470
affected by either of those because we

529
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,660
really depend on<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the way it</font>

530
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,400
disappears in order to make the decision

531
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that should be independent of either</font>

532
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those</font>

533
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:07,080
Phil Rosenthal<font color="#CCCCCC"> firm is prime I'm curious</font>

534
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:10,169
if you you know so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had it in I guess</font>

535
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,000
a number of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs and but with</font>

536
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:14,670
only a limited number of Wi-Fi access

537
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,800
points it's certainly possible that

538
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,900
different ISPs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and different model</font>

539
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,210
access points might have different<font color="#CCCCCC"> size</font>

540
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:24,510
buffers different queue management some

541
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:27,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">might be running read some tail drum you</font>

542
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:30,810
know have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you considered how that falls</font>

543
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:32,780
into your methodology um so we've we

544
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:36,720
tested it on not too many access points

545
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:38,430
we only tested<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on you know the access</font>

546
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,160
points that we had a chance of deploying

547
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,690
on so yes you're right we need to

548
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,660
calibrate this whenever we have a

549
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,820
different deployment one half of the

550
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:51,240
algorithm needs to be recalibrated which

551
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,620
is the latency threshold that we use to

552
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,040
say that the wireless is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bottleneck</font>

553
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,389
and it is entirely possible that

554
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:02,970
depending on the queuing taking you to

555
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:04,680
use inside the wireless access point the

556
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,110
results may vary<font color="#CCCCCC"> your mileage may vary</font>

557
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,580
mean if it's a very efficient queuing

558
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,439
algorithm it's possible that you know

559
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,449
there's overlap between the medium

560
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,220
access time and the queuing delays and

561
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,810
that might start confronting us but as

562
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,850
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as when for the other half</font>

563
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:19,830
detecting an access link button like it

564
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:22,050
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really independent of that</font>

565
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:24,330
because as long as the work as long as

566
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:26,220
the queue is work conserving it should

567
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:29,820
give us this neat little distinction

568
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:35,580
between a bottleneck link and a non

569
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:38,939
bottleneck link thank you oh hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">concur my girl from Microsoft actually I</font>

571
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:45,060
had almost similar question as him about

572
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,950
thresholds which you guys are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using so</font>

573
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:50,040
are you using any machine learning

00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:52,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">techniques to for the variable threshold</font>

575

to change in diamond dynamically

576
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:59,100
according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to congestion in the network</font>

577
00:24:54,930 --> 00:25:01,080
or well we are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect</font>

578
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:04,080
transition in the network we did try

579
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:07,409
fancy things mean we saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know a</font>

580
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,929
simple static threshold just works

581
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,790
perfectly fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we really didn't need</font>

582
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:13,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font>

583
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:15,649
so that means you keep the same

584
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:21,860
threshold all the time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a particular</font>

585
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:23,570
platform yes okay okay just just a

586
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,520
program note I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've got a number</font>

587
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:30,080
of questioners here so we'll close the

588
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:32,540
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> cues now and thanks let me know</font>

589
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,760
no I mean answer the questions who are

590
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:38,780
cute now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the newcomers we can't</font>

591
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:41,240
service anymore at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cues Adrian Chad</font>

592
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:45,440
Knaus so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my many hats is making</font>

593
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:47,090
wireless stuff most terrible did you do

594
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,540
a couple of questions firstly did you

595
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:52,159
test the behavior of commercial access

596
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,920
points for office and enterprise

597
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,020
deployments vs Holm deployments Helena

598
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,120
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked because having worked on</font>

599
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:01,820
rate control I know that like open wrt

600
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,500
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consumer access points they rate</font>

601
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:06,620
control focuses on through port not

602
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:09,020
latency and fairness<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

603
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,570
you buy over five hundred dollars we

604
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:14,030
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay because all the deployments</font>

605
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:16,100
were you know home commodity rotors so

606
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:18,230
that's what we tested on it doesn't

607
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">surprise me because they're all of those</font>

608
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:21,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">are tested for through port yes and</font>

609
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:24,200
that's that's something that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

610
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:26,780
we have seen typically across<font color="#CCCCCC"> minute</font>

611
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,960
both modems and wireless routers in the

612
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:31,730
home space oh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> the having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked</font>

613
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> atheros for a little bit or</font>

614
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:35,120
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has the atheros chip</font>

615
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,800
tends to have the same rate control and

616
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,659
see you and openness wide body of

617
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,389
equipment that has the same vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kerr</font>

618
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:44,780
that behaves precisely the same way so

619
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:46,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the second question was did you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

620
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,190
looking at aggregation efficiency in 11

621
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,290
n because for flows under about 20-25

622
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,970
megabits you'll probably find that

623
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">aggregation isn't kicking in and it is</font>

624
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,120
actually sending one packet at a time

625
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,730
without agri

626
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,379
and then as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty twenty</font>

627
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:03,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">five megabits and it starts aggregating</font>

628
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,900
you hit this hit this the egg gets full

629
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:10,030
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can you get more efficiency out</font>

630
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:13,610
of it so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand dated 11 and</font>

631
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:15,950
very deeply but we did run a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

632
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:17,750
empirical measurements and different

633
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:20,960
access link throughputs like different

634
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:24,170
up you know 10 20 up to 80 megabits per

635
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,050
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we did see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that as long as we</font>

636
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:28,850
are able to achieve you know either the

637
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:31,040
access link what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we set it to other</font>

638
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,990
what we expect the wireless link to be

639
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,389
then these thresholds work really well

640
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:37,490
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if there is aggregation so</font>

641
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:40,180
well if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a 15</font>

642
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:43,400
milliseconds is a pretty large threshold

643
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:44,960
so and you know we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider</font>

644
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,770
different problems with medium access in

645
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:51,740
a contention you know distance you know

646
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:53,720
retransmissions and even accounting for

647
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,120
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you should still see a clear</font>

648
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,700
gap between the case where there's a

649
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:07,370
wireless portal<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't when there isn't</font>

650
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:08,870
Thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> You Jen I you got google thanks</font>

651
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:13,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">very much for bringing this here this is</font>

652
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:17,090
the insides are very nifty from the

653
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:19,100
beings quite nicely that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

654
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:21,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the primary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

655
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,659
that gives you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability to figure out</font>

656
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:28,580
whether the bottleneck is upstream or

657
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:30,560
not and and that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCPS probing trying</font>

658
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,840
to figure out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right rate is and</font>

659
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,639
as I think about that further I was

660
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:36,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering how something like this would</font>

661
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,570
play<font color="#CCCCCC"> with other TCP congestion control</font>

662
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,270
mechanisms that don't do the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

663
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:44,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">probing that you have here and just to</font>

664
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:45,560
finish my question I imagine that

665
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,810
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that kind of</font>

666
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,899
variation going on in the UDB world

667
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:53,030
mm-hmm so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question to use have you</font>

668
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,680
considered have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you seen data but how</font>

669
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:57,440
this plays when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at you d</font>

670
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:00,020
be flows which have a much wider

671
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,140
variation of behaviors well I mean this

672
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:05,840
would obviously breakdown if it's a CD

673
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,910
are you dippy flow right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

674
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,679
really can't make out do you mean unless

675
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:11,960
you know at which rate it's

676
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,600
being sent at you can't figure out you

677
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,300
know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been shaped or not as</font>

678
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:20,780
far as TCP goes as long as there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

679
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:23,419
probing of the network that would

680
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,820
introduce some variation which the

681
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:28,100
bottleneck link<font color="#E5E5E5"> would then smooth out so</font>

682
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,139
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to detect that I'd</font>

683
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,600
imagine the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is true for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> c4</font>

684
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:34,850
Judi because most flows are not CBR yeah

685
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,730
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not say BR yes we can we can</font>

686
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:40,040
totally apply this have you looked at we

687
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:43,100
didn't because most of most application

688
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:45,139
traffic is TCP but we could we could

689
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:56,360
focus on specific applications as

690
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:58,570
opposed okay Spencer<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dawkins</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huawei this</font>

691
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,979
is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting I'm actually</font>

692
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:03,530
probably sitting up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm</font>

693
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:05,180
transport area director at the ITF it's

694
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:06,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">very interesting work thank you for</font>

695
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it thank you for bringing out</font>

696
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:11,120
where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> could look at it yep you</font>

697
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:14,530
don't have to worry about what I'm about

698
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,879
to say for a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> or two probably but</font>

699
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:21,740
the work that the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people are</font>

700
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:23,240
doing to reduce buffer<font color="#CCCCCC"> booked and</font>

701
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:32,020
especially work that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do</font>

702
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:34,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">with we do both delay based congestion</font>

703
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,710
mechanisms rather detection mechanisms

704
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:41,090
rather than rather than lost based

705
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:44,600
detection mechanisms that may have some

706
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:47,990
interesting interactions as you as you

707
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,520
continue this work that'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

708
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:52,760
interested in seeing how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that how that</font>

709
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,010
shakes out but thank you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it</font>

710
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,410
well it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting point because</font>

711
00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:00,350
it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

712
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:02,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">considering because if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

713
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:05,810
it what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> while is part of it actually</font>

714
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:10,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">depends on is an excessive maybe buffer</font>

715
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:12,129
right so if you if you fix that<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

716
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:14,659
know the question is you know whether

717
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:17,780
the increase in latency<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you see</font>

718
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:21,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">with medium access or in a contention</font>

719
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:24,639
that sort of thing starts in fringing on

720
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:28,090
on a bottleneck a purely botnet wireless

721
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,010
link the answer is I don't know but yes

722
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:32,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something to consider</font>

723
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:33,640
I mean it racism in the earlier point

724
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,590
that someone else said you know it's

725
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,330
it's optimized for throughput rather

726
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:39,250
than latency right so once you remove

727
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:42,100
that optimization<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know all bets are</font>

728
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:44,500
off but you know we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work</font>

729
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,750
thinking about different different

730
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:51,190
metrics like you know trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

731
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:53,409
correlate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bitrate retransmission</font>

732
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:54,820
rate and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of thing so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you</font>

733
00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:57,850
know those sort of matrix would become

734
00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:03,340
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming more interesting thank</font>

735
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:05,918
you given your research on wireless

736
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:09,520
bottlenecks what role if any do you see

737
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:15,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">as femtocell and related technologies</font>

738
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:20,760
for mitigating wireless bottlenecks up

739
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:22,990
well I mean femtocells basically make

740
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,820
minutes for improving your cellular

741
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,730
connectivity but it should be

742
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:31,260
independent of bottlenecks inside your

743
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:33,850
home I mean there's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one hop</font>

744
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:38,980
inside the home<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know femtocell</font>

745
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:42,610
doesn't really solve right<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean unless</font>

746
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:45,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm misunderstanding a question well i</font>

747
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:49,709
think you've answered it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok all right ok</font>

748
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,710
thanks very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

749
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:00,970
you
