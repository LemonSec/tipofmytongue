accommodating my schedule delays of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 430</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last day of the conference so</font>

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,699
may not be the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to be talking</font>

17
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,860
about cybersecurity regulation but I

18
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,220
will try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it as interesting and</font>

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,110
engaging as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding that</font>

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,460
this isn't typically the type of fair

21
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:16,320
that is presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these conferences</font>

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,939
I'm really have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been enjoying meeting</font>

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,189
engineers and other smart people who are

25
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,898
willing to bring their level of

26
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,750
discourse down to the level<font color="#E5E5E5"> that an</font>

going on with the cyber security

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,670
initiatives in DC this in the past

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,460
couple of years in the patent especially

42
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,500
this year the Obama administration has

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,280
been very active in pushing their agenda

44
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,590
since they came to office in 2009 and

45
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,830
the rate at which they have been

46
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">engaging in calendar year 2015 has been</font>

47
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,240
pretty spectacular so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,910
really go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through and spend most of the</font>

49
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,560
time talking through what the

50
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,799
administration's been working on

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,840
what Congress is addressing right now

52
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,849
and then some of the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> recent that</font>

53
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">basis in fact updates that just happened</font>

54
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:38,220
yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the passage of the USA</font>

55
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">Freedom Act and other legislation that's</font>

56
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,599
pending and then I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna leave plenty</font>

57
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,130
of time for questions so the agenda I

58
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,540
want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is really about you</font>

59
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,459
know the talking about quantifying the

60
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,380
rise in data breaches which is really

61
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,319
driving the administration's cyber

62
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,780
security agenda the framework that the

63
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,369
administration<font color="#E5E5E5"> has proposed other</font>

64
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,660
efforts that they have proposed in

65
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition to their cybersecurity</font>

66
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:06,480
framework congressional responses some

67
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,540
other miscellaneous topics and try to at

68
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,090
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> really help you understand why</font>

69
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">you should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't</font>

70
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,019
because many of the people in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> room</font>

71
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,369
are going to be the folks that once

72
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:19,590
rules and regulations are ultimately in

73
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,290
place are going to be required<font color="#CCCCCC"> to design</font>

74
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,880
network architectures and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

75
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">your networks are compliant with</font>

76
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:32,549
whatever regulatory regime gets adopted

77
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:33,900
so with that let's jump right in anybody

78
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,820
who's paying any kind of attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

79
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the news knows that the number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of data</font>

80
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:42,750
breaches and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyberattacks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is rapidly</font>

81
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,899
increasing there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> record high in 2014</font>

82
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:49,250
of 783 incidents so far this year alone

83
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,459
as of<font color="#CCCCCC"> April 21st have been 256 breaches</font>

84
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:55,769
hundreds of millions of records exposed

85
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:58,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the most recent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

86
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:02,010
biggest infant most infamous recent

87
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,810
breach that has come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> light and I'm</font>

88
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:09,510
sure we're going to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> about many more</font>

89
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:12,720
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the year drags on again</font>

90
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,519
just kind of showing quantifying what

91
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,750
how these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> have increased from</font>

92
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:22,440
20,000 from 2010 when we had 662

93
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,419
breaches to the 783 major breaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

94
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:31,919
the identity theft Resource Center noted

95
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:33,630
in in 2014 so those breaches along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

96
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,109
congressional efforts are really what's

97
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,870
driving the administration's

98
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:41,090
natori agenda and the president

99
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,150
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> in january-february was out</font>

100
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,739
there at every possible turn talking

101
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,320
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> his cyber security and data</font>

102
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,850
security agenda and trying to work with

103
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,830
Congress I mean this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the few</font>

104
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in Washington that there can</font>

105
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,349
there's some some notion of agreement on

106
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:00,170
the details certainly get contentious

107
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,350
but everyone agrees that it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

108
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,600
that is extremely critical and if you're

109
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,700
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people candidly especially</font>

110
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in Homeland Security other</font>

111
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,170
executive agencies you know the biggest

112
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,210
fear<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have is the day when the</font>

113
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:17,030
electrical grid gets taken down or the

114
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,820
financial transaction system gets

115
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:21,919
affected in some meaningful way and so

116
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,230
all these efforts are<font color="#CCCCCC"> aimed at editing</font>

117
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,570
off any kind of major attack like that

118
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:31,160
that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bring the economy to</font>

119
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:33,950
its knees and then there's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

120
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,360
the consumer facing privacy and data

121
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,670
security proposals that are out there

122
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are really probably less relevant</font>

123
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,080
to to the people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> room but to the</font>

124
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,440
extent that there are kind of consumer

125
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,870
facing breaches that that operators face

126
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">there certainly is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an angle and I'll</font>

127
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk a little about them about the</font>

128
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:57,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">Telstra breach that just was came to</font>

129
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:59,270
light and at the end of<font color="#CCCCCC"> last month so</font>

130
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,010
the first time the president<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font>

131
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,320
about his cybersecurity framework was in

132
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,539
2013 in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> state of the union</font>

133
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,270
address he released that framework in

134
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:11,750
February and really was urging companies

135
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,099
to adopt best practices including

136
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,230
addressing all of their digital

137
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,140
infrastructure and assets including

138
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:19,700
undersea cables including all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

139
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,580
lines that people in operators in this

00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:29,510
room are<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maintaining and</font>

141
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:32,960
protecting you know it's arguably not

142
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:34,849
gone very far<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways including</font>

143
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,820
going far enough in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what it</font>

144
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:40,100
addresses it's entirely voluntary it

145
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,650
lacks some of the incentives that that

146
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,740
industry has sought and there's been a

147
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,479
particularly active group of folks that

148
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,009
through the US Chamber that have been

149
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,680
talking with the administration about

150
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:54,860
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to see in the</font>

151
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,960
framework but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you know my final</font>

152
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,380
conclusion is that it's too too soon to

153
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,888
<font color="#CCCCCC">say that this thing was a failure or</font>

154
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:05,030
success it really is has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been guiding</font>

155
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:07,880
for the last couple of years the

156
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:12,198
administration's<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow-on efforts and</font>

157
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:15,169
so again in this year the president

158
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:18,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked a lot about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity at DHS</font>

159
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:21,770
and they put out some some cybersecurity

160
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:24,440
legislation and one piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of legislation</font>

161
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:26,630
that contains a member of the

162
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,550
initiatives<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the administration was</font>

163
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,860
was focused on is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

164
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,900
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming up for a vote in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

165
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">Senate at the end of this month if you</font>

166
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:39,859
believe what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear on Capitol Hill</font>

167
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,900
but there's a number of incentives that

168
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,009
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> propose to get people to share this</font>

169
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,679
information that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really been the</font>

170
00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:48,050
biggest focus of all these proposed

171
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,060
pieces of legislation as well as the

172
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,020
framework and the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

173
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,460
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't want to share</font>

174
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,770
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously nobody wants to</font>

175
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a black eye in the public no one</font>

176
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">wants to be facing potential liability</font>

177
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,250
from class actions from shareholders

178
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,370
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of reasons why people</font>

179
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,169
don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> breeches to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come to light but</font>

180
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,880
there's a lot of reasons why it's

181
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:10,430
important that the steering to this type

182
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,289
of information takes place and so that's

183
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:17,050
why the liability protections are

184
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:17,050
certainly a key piece of the puzzle

185
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:24,590
there's also been a focus on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability</font>

186
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:26,840
of law enforcement to utilize you know

187
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,429
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it DHS has this disposal</font>

188
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,818
including shared information to address

189
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,620
cyber crime and again this is going to

190
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:38,029
be a major<font color="#E5E5E5"> item as things like the IRS</font>

191
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:43,490
attack and other industrial attacks come

192
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:45,079
to light moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of out of</font>

193
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,709
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber realm into the privacy and</font>

194
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:51,380
data security efforts there's been a lot

195
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:54,140
of focus on on that legislation on the

196
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,779
Big Data Report on the executive order

197
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the President signed addressing</font>

198
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:00,680
cyber threat information sharing

199
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:04,579
and then a consumer privacy Bill of

200
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,170
Rights Congress has also gotten involved

201
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:07,969
in the picture there<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been a number</font>

202
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:11,180
of hearings the Senate Commerce

203
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:14,320
Committee had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing in January house</font>

204
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:17,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">commerce got involved also more recently</font>

205
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,329
the house energy and commerce

206
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:23,719
subcommittee had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge on their</font>

207
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:27,380
legislation and so these are kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

208
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,930
key provisions here HR 1560 protecting

209
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:34,250
cyber networks that bill passed the

210
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:36,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">House in April it's been sent over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

211
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,899
the Senate and it's reasonably likely

212
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:41,959
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is probably going to get</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's kind of on hold but some some</font>

216
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,459
common themes among among these pieces

217
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,750
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> legislation again mostly relating to</font>

218
00:09:51,459 --> 00:10:01,160
sharing of information of threat

219
00:09:53,750 --> 00:10:03,290
information and liability protection the

220
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,480
Big Data Report I'm sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in this</font>

221
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,969
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably heard this heard about</font>

222
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">this if they haven't read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it this is</font>

223
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,019
probably again less relevant to carriers

224
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:14,899
and network operators but it does

225
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:17,389
address some of the ways that companies

226
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:19,069
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room might be utilizing big data</font>

227
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:20,720
and it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of outlines</font>

228
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:23,569
what's important to the administration

229
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,000
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of the initiatives that they'd</font>

230
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:27,260
like to see industry adopt and this is

231
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,519
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> more about this is more of a</font>

232
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,959
consumer-facing report calling on

233
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,420
basically legalization of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bay data for</font>

234
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,149
law enforcement but also asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

235
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:42,500
industry to kind of curtail some of the

236
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:45,170
ways if that big data<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being used so</font>

237
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's mix a few recommendations again</font>

238
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,519
they're pushing their privacy Bill of

239
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,229
Rights they're urging the passage of

240
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,839
national data breach legislation this

241
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,300
has been a big initiative that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

242
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,370
companies care deeply about because

243
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,459
right now we're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a basically</font>

244
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,529
a 49 state patchwork quilt of data

245
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:06,680
breach obligations and so when a breach

246
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,880
happens you're forced to conduct

247
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,400
different sets of breach notification

248
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,030
activities depending

249
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:15,130
which state where the consumers reside

250
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:17,110
and so that's a real pain and<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

251
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,450
that industry is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping will be</font>

252
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,010
addressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometime soon there's also</font>

253
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,710
been a push to amend<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Electronic</font>

254
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:28,180
Communications Privacy Act this is an

active dates back to the 80s that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in</font>

256
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,400
dire need of being updated the most most

257
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,840
Republicans in Congress<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have</font>

258
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,579
different ideas about what's the

259
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,400
appropriate way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> update this act and</font>

260
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,440
most involve again curtailing ways in

261
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:45,069
which the government can obtain and

262
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,560
utilize information and put put<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

263
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,200
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of higher walls around the way that</font>

264
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,160
that corporations and industry can share

265
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">information with the government</font>

266
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,610
including requiring usage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a warrants</font>

267
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,880
again another<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on law enforcement</font>

268
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,860
in the way that laws ways that law

269
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,730
enforcement can utilize big data<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

270
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,830
their jobs<font color="#CCCCCC"> better the other thing that</font>

00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:13,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the administration</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has done is created</font>

00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:16,440
the CTI<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see the CTIC is basically the</font>

cyber version of the National terror

cyber version of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> initiative that</font>

278
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,280
again allows the government to

279
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:33,760
coordinate among agencies information

280
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:37,329
about cyber threats that are either you

281
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:40,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">know very very much you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

282
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:44,410
horizon or or some other information

agencies you'd be amazed how how little

288
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,850
information sometimes gets passed among

289
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,350
agencies in Washington and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font>

290
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,060
enable government agencies to really

291
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,770
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other and have a single</font>

292
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,420
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of contact with in the relevant</font>

293
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,770
agencies to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that the right</font>

294
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,360
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the right agencies know</font>

295
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:12,670
exactly what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on at any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> given</font>

296
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:15,090
time and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> on februari 12th of the</font>

297
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">President signed an executive order</font>

298
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:19,240
basically again aimed at this goal of

299
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,520
promoting private sector security

300
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,190
information sharing

301
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,340
and you probably get tired of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hearing</font>

302
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,110
this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really has been the major</font>

303
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,810
focus of the administration's efforts

304
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,970
and of legislation that's pending in

305
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,160
Congress is allowing companies to share

306
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,050
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> both with each other as well</font>

307
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,130
as with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government and also allowing</font>

308
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,260
for the government to share information

309
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,520
with industry because right now there's

310
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,319
a lot of barriers that kind of

311
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:48,300
information sharing happening and in any

312
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,100
kind of seamless or coordinated way and

313
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:54,479
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a quote from from the order</font>

314
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,400
itself the other thing that that the

315
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,500
executive<font color="#E5E5E5"> order does is establish a</font>

316
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,890
framework so again these are voluntary

317
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,680
standards for information sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

318
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:06,810
clarifies<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHS is authority to enter into</font>

319
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:09,780
agreements with information sharing

320
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:12,239
organizations and it streamlines the

321
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:15,569
ability of companies to to access

322
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,310
classified information and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

323
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,830
it's going to set up a framework kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

324
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,829
an industry by industry basis and then

325
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:24,990
establish basically the gun the single

326
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,210
point of contact and hopefully

327
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">streamline and remove some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

328
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:34,650
barriers from information<font color="#E5E5E5"> sharing that</font>

329
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:36,210
exists today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the president also</font>

330
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:39,720
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the four</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> principles that</font>

331
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:42,150
really should be guiding private

332
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,590
industry as well as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government when</font>

333
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:47,569
they're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about sharing</font>

334
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:49,440
information and again share share share

335
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:53,090
recognize when government might be able

336
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,950
to help basically look at your own

337
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:57,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">company's best practices and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> governments</font>

338
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,730
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agencies need</font>

339
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at their best practices</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

340
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,690
you know of focus on what has really

341
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">become a very hot issue again with the</font>

342
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,730
discussion around the USA Freedom<font color="#CCCCCC"> Act</font>

343
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,340
which addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NSA bulk collection</font>

344
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:14,370
program so there's really been kind of a

345
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">different mindset and really it's been</font>

346
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,730
driven by a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> generation of</font>

347
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,230
Republicans in Congress that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

348
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,030
different mindset about what's the

349
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,250
appropriate level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data collection a</font>

350
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:23,970
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Democrats are on the same side</font>

351
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,860
but

352
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,990
it really has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been folks like Rand Paul</font>

353
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,629
who really faced off with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mitch</font>

354
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:33,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">McConnell over this issue and it was</font>

355
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,709
what led to to the passage of the USA

356
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:39,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">Freedom Act and it is signing by the</font>

357
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:41,489
president yesterday again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the</font>

00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:44,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">administration's been urging for a long</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rights and they put out a framework</font>

361
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:53,129
largely this was driven by concerns well

362
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,508
plenty of concerns domestically<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

363
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:56,399
there's also been some some

364
00:15:54,509 --> 00:16:00,029
international concerns particularly with

365
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:03,149
our friends in Europe<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the way that</font>

366
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:04,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">our privacy legislation exists or</font>

367
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:07,670
doesn't exist we're really the only

368
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:10,889
country that doesn't have an omnibus

369
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:13,259
privacy statute that addresses privacy

370
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:15,060
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy statutes are really kind of</font>

371
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:17,279
an industry by industry basis and so

372
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,469
you've got privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> laws that pertain to</font>

373
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,350
the financial<font color="#CCCCCC"> services in history to</font>

374
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:25,009
health care through HIPAA<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

375
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:29,220
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got kind of what the FTC does but</font>

376
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:33,120
this is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of codify</font>

377
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:37,129
under one umbrella the rules of the road

378
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,779
for privacy and for data security and so

379
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:42,689
the provisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the bill that the</font>

380
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:44,339
president has proposed really address

381
00:16:42,689 --> 00:16:45,870
what the FTC<font color="#CCCCCC"> is telling people to do and</font>

382
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,189
that's provide conspicuous notice about

383
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,410
how you're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use customer data</font>

384
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:51,709
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that data is used for</font>

vote for the purpose that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's intended</font>

386
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:56,609
and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that customers have a way</font>

387
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,339
to have their data deleted and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

388
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,079
largely the same way that consumers in

389
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,490
Europe have you know a right to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

390
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:05,339
forgotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a right to correct</font>

391
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:09,390
information in a more streamlined way

392
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:11,069
than than anything that we have here it

393
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,539
would permit industries to develop codes

394
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:16,020
of conduct<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be approved by the</font>

395
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:18,480
FTC<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it would have power the FTC</font>

396
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">and state AG's to enforce those those</font>

397
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,110
privacy policies and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really I</font>

398
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:24,780
mean quite frankly not much different

399
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:27,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">than the way it works now nobody's</font>

400
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,850
required to have a privacy policy in

401
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,779
place believe it or not but everyone

402
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:36,389
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the watchword for</font>

403
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:38,099
for for that kind of compliances you

404
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:40,408
have to basically do what you say you're

405
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:43,229
going to do otherwise the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FTC you might</font>

406
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:45,330
come after you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so when it's</font>

407
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:48,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">something really egregious you know the</font>

408
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,489
FTC looks for the right cases to make

409
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:53,459
public and to really try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

410
00:17:50,489 --> 00:17:56,489
example of and those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> really really</font>

411
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:59,369
ugly things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get involved with it's</font>

412
00:17:56,489 --> 00:18:03,029
hugely expensive to go through an

413
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:05,939
investigation by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the FTC to negotiate a</font>

414
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:07,889
consent decree and then to comply with

415
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,989
that consent decree most of the

416
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:12,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">settlements that the FTC reaches our</font>

417
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:16,109
20-year agreements that require in many

418
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:19,589
cases annual audits and so think about

419
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:21,839
the compliance costs of once you're kind

420
00:18:19,589 --> 00:18:26,879
of in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> territory and it would make</font>

you keep you up at night again this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

422
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:30,629
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of what what what the</font>

423
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:32,519
protections are that the administration

424
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:35,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">is advocating in their consumer privacy</font>

Bill of Rights individual control over

what data is collected right now a lot

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies and particularly apps</font>

they're doing so this is intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

431
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:54,658
address that concern transparency in

432
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,399
terms of understanding what<font color="#E5E5E5"> what exactly</font>

433
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:58,109
what the companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are collecting</font>

434
00:18:56,399 --> 00:19:01,830
the data are doing with it how they're

435
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:03,599
using it I respect for context and again

436
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,580
this goes to kind of the overreach

437
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,979
that's happening in many cases where

438
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,049
companies are collecting way more data

439
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:11,700
than they need because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can and</font>

440
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:18,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that data can be extremely</font>

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:20,369
extremely valuable security again we

442
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">need standards common standards industry</font>

443
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:26,639
standards as to how to handle certain

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,529
personal data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the ability to to</font>

445
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:31,859
address mistakes which are inevitably

446
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:36,210
going to be made when personal data in

447
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:38,099
huge volumes is being collected focus

448
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,729

overreach concern and the ability to

00:19:41,729 --> 00:19:46,710
basically have

451
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:48,360
have a right to make sure that measures

452
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:53,309
are in place and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were being</font>

453
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:54,539
adhere to this is what I'm talking about

454
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:56,700
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit now what's been happening</font>

455
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:59,970
recently this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> story that came out</font>

456
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,830
at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> May and i thought was</font>

457
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,799
directly pertinent to folks in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room</font>

458
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:09,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know folks mattel strike here but</font>

459
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:11,639
when after shortly after the closing of

460
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:14,428
the acquisition of pacnet was revealed

461
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:17,580
that their corporate network had been

462
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:21,289
hacked and they still<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know to this</font>

463
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:25,049
day who was responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that or who</font>

464
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:26,669
was behind it kind of pointed out the

465
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:29,369
fact that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this these kinds of</font>

466
00:20:26,669 --> 00:20:31,440
hacks can happen not only to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IRS but</font>

467
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:34,379
to very sophisticated network operators

468
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,519
and you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people a lot of</font>

469
00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:41,580
bad actors that are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on</font>

470
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:45,690
accessing this data for a variety of

471
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:48,749
reasons but it's it's it's a big problem

472
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:50,759
it's only going to get worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suspect I</font>

473
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:53,039
mentioned the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the USA</font>

474
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,619
Freedom Act was signed by the president

475
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:59,940
yesterday again that really just goes to

476
00:20:55,619 --> 00:21:04,918
a major revision of the way that section

477
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:06,929
702 of the FISA act is addressed it

478
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,960
addresses the bulk collection of phone

479
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:11,970
records and basically allows the NSA to

480
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">hold those records for six months and</font>

481
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:18,570
then turn the back over to the phone

482
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:20,460
companies I guess there's perhaps more

483
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,408
public trust in the phone companies than

484
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,529
the NSA these days and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that was</font>

485
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:28,200
largely what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was driving those changes</font>

486
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:30,509
that were made by the by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the folks who</font>

487
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,179
were in long negotiations with Senator

00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:34,919

passed by the end of the month most

492
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:43,379
likely the other thing that I think is

493
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">really worth touching on I don't have a</font>

494
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:48,439
slide and unfortunately

495
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:50,720
this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bear and this is a real</font>

496
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,090
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's happening with regard to</font>

497
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,920
the open Internet order I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

498
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,590
presentation was<font color="#E5E5E5"> made on Monday about</font>

499
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:00,620
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real nitty-gritty of what's</font>

500
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:03,439
what's in that order but on May

501
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:07,100
fifteenth chairman wheeler chairman of

502
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,500
the FCC<font color="#E5E5E5"> issued some guidance about how</font>

503
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,870
companies who provide broadband internet

504
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,180
access service should be complying with

505
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:17,360
section 222<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Communications Act</font>

506
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:21,350
and not to get too far into the weeds on

507
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,659
this but basically now that the

508
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:26,350
broadband internet access is being

509
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:30,020
regulated as a telecommunication service

510
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:32,449
section 222 now applies to the provision

511
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:35,030
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's a</font>

512
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:38,900
number of obligations that are going to

513
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:40,670
be imposed on on carriers who are

514
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,850
providing information providing internet

515
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:45,440
access that up till this point in time

516
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:48,379
had never been subject to these kinds of

517
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,420
rules and so it's basically a code of

518
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">conduct and those rules the specific</font>

519
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:55,910
rules around section 2 22's application

520
00:22:53,900 --> 00:23:00,200
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet services isn't clear because</font>

521
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:02,120
again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> was in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effects yet there was</font>

522
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,010
also a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of legal challenges to the</font>

523
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,600
order although<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think personally that</font>

524
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:09,320
those challenges are not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

525
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,300
successful when when the ecstasy adopted

526
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,950
the open and open Internet order they

527
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,740
really were following the<font color="#CCCCCC"> roadmap that</font>

528
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:19,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the DC Circuit gave to them when they</font>

529
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:22,880
rejected<font color="#E5E5E5"> the prior set of open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

530
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,129
principles and so I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

531
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,050
unlikely that we open an open<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

532
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">or that the FCC's adapted is going to be</font>

533
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:30,020
overturned on appeal although there's a

534
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:32,540
lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would really love to</font>

535
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:36,920
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happen including some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:38,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">clients but that that's that's something</font>

537
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,790
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of folks in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this room are</font>

538
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:43,010
going to have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be concerned about once</font>

539
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:45,260
all the provisions of the FCC's open

540
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:49,370
Internet order ultimately going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

541
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:51,260
fact so with that I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> skip</font>

542
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,449
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nuts and bolts of the</font>

00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:18,678
it shortly be time for drinks my name is

neutrality traffic measures in 2009 and

554
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:33,678
the sky didn't fall in your opinion what

555
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:36,980
are the principal reasons why you

556
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:40,400
believe on reasonable grounds we hope

557
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:43,580
that the FCC's open access order will be

558
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:48,140
maintained by the courts well<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

559
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:50,449
because the decision that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DC Circuit</font>

560
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:53,780
issued striking down the last set of

561
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:55,760
rules kind of spelled out exactly what

562
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,139
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did wrong at great length when they</font>

563
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,290
did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I was a pretty lengthy</font>

564
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:03,950
order and they really said that what the

565
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:05,450
FCC didn't do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time was so you</font>

566
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,059
have to go back to really you know

567
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,520
computer to and the 80s<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

568
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:13,490
distinction between<font color="#CCCCCC"> inc remember them</font>

569
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,600
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do too but I would like luckily</font>

570
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,600
for better or worse I wasn't involved

571
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,639
with any FCC rule makings at that time

572
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,620
but you know the FCC created a

573
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,340
distinction between telecommunication

574
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:28,879
services and information services in in

575
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:32,330
the computer to rule making and that

576
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,480
distinction was maintained in the 1996

577
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:38,418
Telecommunications Act and so you had

578
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,980
this distinction that said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know one</font>

579
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:41,320

services but in order to promote

589
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:06,800
internet adoption and usage there was a

590
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:08,059
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Congress and at the FCC</font>

who said look we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a</font>

00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:16,879
all that you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that perfectly</font>

595
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:19,549
true but the reclassification of all

596
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:22,459
this back into carriage and therefore

597
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:27,129
the common carriage rules right strike

598
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:28,940
us is sensible on policy grounds but

599
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:31,189
procedurally they didn't do the right

600
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,619
through the right steps to do that they

601
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:36,950
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they kind of just turned</font>

602
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:38,478
on a dime and and said you know what

603
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,570
we're changing her mind about the way

604
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:42,889
that we're going to ultimately

605
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:45,139
reclassify without saying that we're

606
00:26:42,889 --> 00:26:47,478
reclassifying and so they applied a

607
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:49,609
number of obligations apply to common

608
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:51,139
carriage inn in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first open Internet</font>

609
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:53,840
rules so you believe they've just done

610
00:26:51,139 --> 00:26:55,549
it properly now that the way they've

611
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,220
done it properly has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

612
00:26:55,549 --> 00:27:00,649
they've given the menu for doing this by

613
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:07,129
the court already and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it therefore</font>

614
00:27:00,649 --> 00:27:09,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">will withstand the sharp-eyed lawyers of</font>

00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:24,259
next up above them is the supreme court

621
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:26,029
so yes they<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically said look FCC when</font>

622
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:27,259
you did this the first time you didn't

628
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:42,978
here's what you should have done and

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the FCC did I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to put</font>

that the FCC has come to its conclusions

perfectly reason

00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:26,920
Oh answer thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike Joseph Google</font>

646
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:29,620
on the topic of information sharing and

00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,210
cyber security obligations during of

648
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,860
course you're talking both highlighted

649
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,320
the efforts from the administration<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

650
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:37,120
Congress to enable protections and

651
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,760
methods by which you can encourage

652
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,260
information sharing largely voluntary by

653
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,080
corporations with government agencies

654
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:47,230
but then simultaneously you point out

655
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,210
that particularly light of the NSA

656
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:51,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">activities but but also more generally</font>

657
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:55,000
there's been an<font color="#CCCCCC"> effort to increase</font>

658
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:56,980
privacy controls both within the private

659
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,390
sector<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact that</font>

660
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:01,630
one bullet point you highlight that

661
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:03,850
there's pending legislation to create

662
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:06,100
more barriers for information sharing in

663
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:09,129
certain cases so which direction do you

664
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:12,820
see the wind blowing predominantly right

665
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:14,500
now in DC I think that the legislation<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

666
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:17,590
was mentioning that it that i think is

667
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:20,440
likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pass is going to promote kind</font>

668
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:24,270
of higher level information sharing that

669
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:27,430
doesn't pertain to specific consumer

670
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:29,170
identifying information so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think i</font>

671
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:31,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">think i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the wind is blowing</font>

672
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:33,010
to answer question and its most simple

673
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:37,560
terms is going to blow in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> direction</font>

674
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:40,690
of making sharing easier and without

675
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,730
potential liability and i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on sharing that that i think</font>

677
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:46,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people are focused</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

681
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,140
mean of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government has a lot</font>

682
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,000
of information about certain attacks

00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,920
that they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not want to there's a lot</font>

684
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">of reluctance I think by agencies to</font>

685
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">make this public and just share with</font>

686
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:07,510
industry because you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

687

only there's not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh legal reasons</font>

688
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,230
why they can't do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> now but there's</font>

689
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:13,180
also kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of policy reasons why they</font>

information with the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

724
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:26,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">government would redistribute that</font>

725
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:28,229
information back to member entities

726
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:29,908
that's part of what the president really

727
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:32,580
wants to do with the creation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

728
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:35,129
cyber threat mechanism is to create

729
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,289
basically a single portal for that kind

730
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:39,478
of sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so that that information</font>

731
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:41,190
can go in both directions and then again

732
00:31:39,479 --> 00:31:43,320
to your point be dispersed among the

733
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,580
relevant executive agencies of the

734
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,408
government so yeah I think that's

735
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,389
absolutely the direction that the

736
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:50,489
administration wants to see things move

737
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:52,439
and whether the next administration who

738
00:31:50,489 --> 00:31:54,269
that is will maintain that I think it's

739
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,759
a pretty common-sense policy that has

740
00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:58,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">gotten a lot of buy-in now and so I</font>

741
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:00,149
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that especially I think there's</font>

742
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:03,960
really nobody that would tell you that

743
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:06,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">they think that the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terror kind of</font>

744
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,070
clearing house that was created<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2001</font>

745
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,830
hasn't worked I mean that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

746
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,928
hasn't been a major terrorist attack on

747
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:15,509
US soil so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

748
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:16,979
buy-in on every level and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that</font>

749
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:18,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the framer that we're</font>

750
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:22,039
going to see ultimately put in place and

751
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:22,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">carried out thank you</font>

Michael Thompson Argonne National Labs

753
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,950
partially in response to the other

754
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:35,000
questions but I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to point out</font>

755
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:36,110
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for your talk I think there's</font>

756
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,350
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of distress from the private</font>

757
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:40,969
sector about what various<font color="#E5E5E5"> things the</font>

758
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:43,490
federal government is<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and I think</font>

759
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it's important to point out that</font>

760
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:49,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">there the federal government</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge</font>

761
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:53,120
and disorganized entity or set of

762
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:54,979
entities and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the right</font>

763
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,080
hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> not knowing what the left hand is</font>

764
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,600
doing but also I think it's important to

765
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are large portions</font>

766
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the federal government that are</font>

767
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:04,219
legitimately trying to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> positive</font>

768
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:07,280
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect critical</font>

769
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,990
infrastructure but but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

770
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,020
difficult to do that without private

771
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:14,600
sector cooperation and I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

772
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:18,530
understandable and and commendable the

773
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,719
private sector wants to see you know

774
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,310
transparency and and wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

775
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,250
accountability in any data that they

776
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:26,750
share but that that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know really the</font>

777
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,340
private sector<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of ways holds</font>

778
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:30,410
sort of the keys to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kingdom as far</font>

779
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,480
as the data and without that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

780
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:34,010
willingness to share and I think the

781
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,570
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the other question brought up</font>

782
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:37,670
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> having these sort of information</font>

783
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">clearing houses where different private</font>

784
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:42,850
sector entities can come together have

785
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:45,020
sort of a third<font color="#CCCCCC"> party to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to help</font>

786
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:47,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">facilitate that information sharing with</font>

787
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:49,670
PCI I protections and other things is is

788
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:52,280
great and there needs to be more of that

789
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:53,750
but sort of raising the level of

790
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,790
awareness and bringing out the fact that

791
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,650
there are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know various government</font>

792
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:59,270
entities that are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do positive</font>

793
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:00,860
things in the best way that they know

794
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:04,490
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that there's there's not</font>

795
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:06,590
necessarily this you know one entity is

796
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,540
trying to like trick the other or

797
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:10,610
whatever but you know there are positive

798
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:12,830
things happening and I think more

799
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:15,140
cooperation is going to make that bring

800
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:17,029
the transparency level up I agree I

801
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:19,489
agree that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's everybody who's</font>

802
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,810
dealing with us in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevant federal</font>

803
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:22,189
agencies are trying to do the right

804
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:23,078
thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think that anybody is is</font>

805
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:26,200
as

806
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:27,309
as any ill motives and to your point the

807
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:30,009
government does recognize that they

808
00:34:27,309 --> 00:34:32,309
can't do this alone but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need they</font>

809
00:34:30,009 --> 00:34:35,049
need the trust and the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

810
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:37,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">private sector to flow to them so I</font>

811
00:34:35,049 --> 00:34:38,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you know in light of what's</font>

812
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:41,259
happened you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know since the Snowden</font>

813
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:44,168
revelations and other issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

814
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:47,679
been a huge campaign to try to repair

815
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:49,629
some of that credibility problem but I

816
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,809
mean in the other point if you read the

817
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:54,940
911 report you do understand how

818
00:34:51,809 --> 00:34:57,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">horribly disjointed and the fact that</font>

819
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:59,529
there is there was very little ability

820
00:34:57,309 --> 00:35:01,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">even if they wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to for agencies to</font>

821
00:34:59,529 --> 00:35:03,519
exchange this information in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any kind of</font>

822
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,109
an organized way and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

823
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:07,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">what what the administration is focusing</font>

824
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:10,328
on is trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of create a</font>

825
00:35:07,059 --> 00:35:12,609
framework that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is known to everyone that</font>

826
00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:15,180
there's public agreement upon and then

827
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:17,979
to allow that information to flow freely

828
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:20,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jeff Houston a painting I'm not a US</font>

830
00:35:20,769 --> 00:35:25,899
have personal privacy what people are

831
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">you talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about for example the</font>

European legislation about the right to

00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:32,680

about personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> privacy in the u.s.</font>

841
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:51,099
is everywhere and personal data about

00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:53,859
all kinds of people is in all kinds of

843

00:35:53,859 --> 00:35:58,900
talking about in the u.s. context

00:35:56,019 --> 00:36:01,930
referring only to u.s. citizens or all

846
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:04,329
personal data irrespective<font color="#CCCCCC"> of where they</font>

847

might reside that is inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> uris</font>

848
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:09,130
jurisdictional areas well that's a

849
00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:10,989
debate that's actually playing out very

850
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:14,849
publicly right now with with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft</font>

851
00:36:10,989 --> 00:36:18,279
case and where where Microsoft is really

852
00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:23,289
defending very very very vociferously

853
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:25,599
their rights to maintain data off of the

854
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:26,799
US soil and and and the government

855
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,140
saying look we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care where you</font>

856
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:30,849
store this data we want access to it so

857
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,319
I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that yes the</font>

858
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:34,180
administration's efforts are focused on

859
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:37,000
on American citizens because that's

860
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:40,810
the only jurisdiction that that they had

861
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,360
that we have but yeah there's there's

862
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:45,580
certainly a lot of holes and you know

863
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the arguably some people argue that you</font>

864
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:50,140
know it's way too late and way too

865
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,930
little at this point in time to kind of

866
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:54,730
put this genie back in the bottle but

867
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:58,839
