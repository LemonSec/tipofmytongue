00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:39,500
result in different latencies in ipv4

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:42,019
and ipv6 so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> start from all the</font>

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,789
adoption of pv6 they was also always

10
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:49,850
erase so ipv6 was always compared to IP

11
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:51,980
before it's clear and they will compare

12
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,399
it like younger and elder brother so

13
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,279
ipv6 this is trying to overtake or to

reach some value of IP before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you enter</font>

are only five kinds of paths that could

69

after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've decided to check maybe</font>

there is some big difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

the previous measurements that were

86
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:50,980
and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very interesting results you</font>

00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:59,290
different the difference for latency in

89
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,960
ipv6 and ipv4 will greatly differ from

90
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:05,160
one internal system to another and here

91
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,960
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I got a challenge a challenge to</font>

for different<font color="#CCCCCC"> internal systems and it's</font>

95

a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult task may be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unsolvable</font>

96
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,330
and I think there are only opportunities

to use ripe Atlas and tones of credits

but I Melissa guy and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided that</font>

just as we were predicted when we speak

other than for IP transit providers but

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:14,810
also is better than any cloud service

and if you compare the number of joy

right our customers in ipv4 and ipv6 in

<font color="#CCCCCC">you interesting it's funny and there is</font>

148
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:29,510
a problem so all we know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mystique</font>

149
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:33,319
is not a member of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Taiwan club but how</font>

150
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:35,120
could we be sure because here we meet a

151
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,909
technical problem I taken of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

152
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,950
that we couldn't check if the person who

<font color="#E5E5E5">gives us for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raised his hands</font>

Taiwan and a technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is that</font>

156
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,839
as soon as there is a turn on systems

157
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,209
that gives customers opportunity to make

to retrieve real relationships between

retrieve possible Taiwan the<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible by</font>

on systems that

tile one at least for ipv6 you see it's

172
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">very interesting so to attend all</font>

184
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:20,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">we see that the traffic in ipv6 is less</font>

before and so that is why the deployment

to the adoption<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ipv6 was delayed in</font>

about Internet in general of things I

unchanged for I think a decade is very

200
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,339
interesting you also must keep in mind

201
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:10,630
when the yuck make any measurements and

202
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:13,120
you can pair in latency between ipv4 and

203
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:15,339
ipv6 you must keep in mind that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

204
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,790
comparing two different graphs you are

not comparing the way how<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

206
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:24,780
go through one graph and i think that

207
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,270
the grow with growth of our value of DV

208
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:32,579
six traffic the difference will become

209
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:35,550
less but of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> while it will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be will</font>

210
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:40,830
become less the grass will interfere

211
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:42,569
they will affect each other and who will

be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> origin and who will be the copy</font>

00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:47,660
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the next equation that we will</font>

214
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,920
see and we will see the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

215
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,010
during next decade thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

listening

good morning Matt<font color="#CCCCCC"> pth from yahoo you</font>

218
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:11,000
made a statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> just towards the end</font>

219
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,759
there that as the traffic grows you

220
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,160
expect the latency numbers that Delta

221
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:18,170
Layton sees to change why do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

222
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that an increase in traffic is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

223
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:24,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the latency results you see I</font>

224
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,990
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will not directly change the</font>

225
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:28,759
latency it will it'll change their do I

226
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,069
owe the difference between grips which

227
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:33,050
is now about fifty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent will become</font>

228
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:35,810
less as soon as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the decreased will</font>

229
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:39,050
become similar the latency will become

230
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:40,670
similar to so increases in traffic will

231
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,878
suddenly force people to change their

232
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:46,069
connectivity models I think increase of

233
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,110
traffic you see there the wake how the

234
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:49,790
traffic goes it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very flexion of</font>

235
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:53,449
economic relationships between a tunnel

00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:58,569
will become payable to ampere to IP

238
00:12:55,699 --> 00:13:02,779
before the economic relationships which

239
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:05,839
will have zero difference or in ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

240
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:08,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">it beautiful so it could simply mean</font>

241
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,939
that either<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike Lieber is about to</font>

242
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:12,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">become a very rich man or the cheer ones</font>

243
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:13,849
are suddenly going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wake up it'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

244
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:20,300
very interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see which happens</font>

245
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:22,339
thank you Mike<font color="#CCCCCC"> Joseph google access I</font>

246
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,229
was wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you've gotten any</font>

247
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:28,459
feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> or comment from hurricane</font>

248
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:30,259
electric about this topic not very much

249
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:32,359
feedbacks from Cairo and electric but

250
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:36,279
there are a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few months of course they</font>

251
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,279
have to thank you

252
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,029
any other questions

253
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:54,510
okay we're at break time now sessions

254
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:54,510
will resume at<font color="#CCCCCC"> four-thirty thank you</font>

255
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,579
you
