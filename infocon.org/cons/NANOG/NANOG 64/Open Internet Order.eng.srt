00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:11,680
quartets and he used<font color="#CCCCCC"> bittorrent to share</font>

149
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:17,180
his barbershop quartets with his fellow

150
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:19,190
aficionados and discovered that for some

151

reason the transmissions were

152
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:24,080
interrupted I think he discovered that

00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:28,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the technical thing that was happening</font>

156
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:37,250
called out a violation and required

Comcast to change its ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> Comcast was</font>

the carrier in question Comcast appealed

159

it went to the DC<font color="#E5E5E5"> Circuit and the DC</font>

160
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:49,189

161
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:53,270
a 2008 decision because the FCC really

162
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:57,320
couldn't identify the authority on which

163
00:08:53,270 --> 00:09:00,500
it had propounded those four principles

164
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think the real problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was there were</font>

165
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,230
principles they weren't rules in any

166
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:12,560
event the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FCC went back to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drawing</font>

167
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:15,170
board in 2010 they came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with an order</font>

168
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:19,069
this time they had rules no blocking no

169
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:22,160
discrimination transparency but again

170
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,370
based on this concept that broadband

171
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,439
internet access service was a

172
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">information service and not a common</font>

carrier tell

174
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:38,870
communication service so this case went

175
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:42,920
finally back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DC Circuit Judge</font>

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:49,189
phenomenal jurist i mean he he ruled

178
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:52,070
against the FCC twice but in each case

179
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,950
it was really well reasoned and he

180
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:59,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">ultimately wrote the decision this</font>

181
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:02,230
decision in 2014 which agreed that that

182
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,990
content discrimination was a problem

183
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:08,660
approved the FCC's logic and authority

184
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,300
to do something about the problem but

185
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:15,620
rejected the FCC's broken model you

186
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:18,890
can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the court said if you call</font>

187
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:21,290
broadband access and information service

188
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:24,380
so your problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what you did back in</font>

189
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:27,219
two thousand two essentially you have to

190
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,510
reclassify broadband as a

191
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:33,230
telecommunications transport service

192
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:35,600
well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> good news for the FCC was that</font>

193
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,810
the DC Circuit decision was really a

197
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:54,560

that were again based on this

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the technology so the FCC reworked the</font>

rules they reclassified broadband as a

telecom service

214
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:49,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh and applied the rules to wireless as</font>

215
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:52,040
well as wireline so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are these rules</font>

216
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,530
going forward well you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> your three</font>

bright line rules no blocking no

218
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:59,360
throttling no paid prioritization you

219
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,950
have a general conduct rule no

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,800
unreasonable interference or

221
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:07,070
unreasonable disadvantage and you have

00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,250
an enhanced privacy excuse me enhance

223
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:12,710
transparency rule which is essentially a

224
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:16,520
consumer protection device you must

225
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:19,610
disclose what your networks are about so

226
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,650
on the no blocking no blocking of

227
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:23,180
content applications or services that's

228
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,600
pretty straightforward there were two

exceptions reasonable network management

230
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,850

00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:34,400

other subject I'm not going to get into

<font color="#E5E5E5">that at all the second rule was no</font>

234
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:42,890
throttling this again is a bright-line

235

rule not addressed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> outright blocking</font>

236
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:47,810
but conduct that inhibits the delivery

249
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:29,630
own content throttling is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> flipside</font>

250
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:33,610
of paid prioritization so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

third rule no paid prioritization

therefore reasonable network management

00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:24,790
does not apply here it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

273
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:44,239
now we have the unreasonable

275
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,000
disadvantage standard this is a general

conduct rule carriers conduct may not

277
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,250
violate one of the three bright line

278
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:56,839
rules but you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> carrier's conduct may</font>

279

not violate one of the three bright line

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,820
rules but may still interfere with the

consumers access to lawful content

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the key here the consumer</font>

283
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:12,260
is in the center of this analysis this

rule governs conduct with edge providers

285
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:19,250
but on a case-by-case basis as we'll see

286
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:22,100
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FCC shied away from really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

involved whenever a lawyer sees the word

290
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:35,649
reasonableness they know that there's a

291
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:41,599
lot of guaranteed work out there for

292
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:48,410
and it's a multi-factor test the number

293
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:51,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">of factors I've highlighted the two most</font>

and application agnostic the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FCC gets</font>

296
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:05,809
really focuses on those two and I

specifically rejected a commercially

reasonable standard that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

318
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:07,669
standard they used in the roaming order

00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:10,100
when they tried to expand wireless

320
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:12,380
roaming they said this is a larger

321
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:13,969
analysis this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

two carriers or what's reasonable

323
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:19,399
between two carriers this is about the

324
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:22,010
public<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest and again the consumer</font>

325
00:17:19,398 --> 00:17:25,969
stands in the middle point of this

326
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:28,840
analysis to specific questions that the

327
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:32,600
FCC mentioned we're sponsored data and

328
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,520
data caps and they would apply they say

329
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,250
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to apply these rules to</font>

330
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,010
those two questions my prediction is

331
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sponsored data will have a very</font>

332
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,809
difficult time but the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> caps</font>

333
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:48,440
particularly wireless data caps as we've

334
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:52,889
seen will will pass muster

335
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:56,700
okay so now we get to the enhancements

336
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:58,710
to the transparency rule the

337
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,140
transparency rule is not a new rule they

338
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:04,740
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not prepare a new rule this this was</font>

339
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:07,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the only rule that survived the DC</font>

340
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,910
Circuit appeal and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

341
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,540
survived is because it's not a common

342
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:17,400
carriage rule it's really a consumer

343
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:20,010
protection rule and so the old rule says

344
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,080
a person engaged in the provision of

345
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:25,460

it application agnostic so when the FCC

406

announced this they made a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal of</font>

saying that this was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

FCC to forbear to not enforce rules in

00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:51,510
the 1996 telecom acts when it finds that

the public interest would not be harmed

00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:40,549
to California carriers are in a dispute

448
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:42,679
even if it concerns interstate traffic

449
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:45,139
there's still two<font color="#E5E5E5"> California carriers</font>

factually interstate what it does mean

457
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:09,259
is that the states are bound<font color="#E5E5E5"> by what the</font>

out so no new state universal service

it's all about terms and conditions and

00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:50,900
issues like roaming so that certainly

492

watershed change in the way the FCC

redefined the endpoints of the network

543
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:15,370

don't regulate it completely as a

a traditional utility what is going to

you've got a monopoly there you have a

real need for in my opinion for some

sort of neutrality or open Internet

fact that broadband is now being

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:53,279
considered an essential service brings

611
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:55,589
up some interesting implications guys we

612
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,450
all know telephone service was declared

613
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:59,129
an essential service and we had things

614
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:02,039
like Universal Service Fund to make sure

615
00:31:59,129 --> 00:32:07,320
that rural areas have have ax had access

to toe telephone service do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see a</font>

point where the current FCC standards

618
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:17,008
for broadband would eventually become a

619
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:20,820
baseline<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some sort of universal</font>

would be a that will ain't necessary or

622

on whether that question<font color="#E5E5E5"> would come up</font>

645

places you've got a long history of

646
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:37,168
regulating carriage because carriage was

647
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:40,860
central to telephony in the internet

648
00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:44,490
carriage is merely the sewage and that

649
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:47,039
the value is in apps and certainly it's

650
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:50,549
true right now that apps are incredibly

00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:58,918

forming monopolies in applications and

657
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:08,760
a regulator in looking at this

658
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:11,098
upper-level world that sits well above

659
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,280
the traditional regulatory environment

660
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:17,129
of carriage I think that's an excellent

661
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,740
question there's did you bet that that

662
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:21,690
was going to be asked as it I know but

663
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:23,459
I've thought about that that's a

664
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:26,099
definitely a question I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

665
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:31,649
I've done some reading and research into

00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:33,659
search bias the all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the attendant</font>

privacy issues that the Europeans are so

668
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:39,810
exercised about there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> doubt that</font>

669
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:43,560
companies like Facebook and Google have

670
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:46,710
tremendous market power but I go back to

671
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:51,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">a very simple principle it's the wires</font>

672
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:54,089
stupid it really is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talk about the</font>

676
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:08,070
these other market problems I think are

677
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:11,280
more the province province of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:14,369
Federal Trade Commission I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the PUC</font>

679
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,619
the California PUC and the federal

680
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:20,730
communications commission would do well

681
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:23,040
to stick to the wires and to the market

682
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:27,109
power that attaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> to those wires and</font>

683

to the act of transportation of

00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:31,470
information so in fact you're saying

685
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,320
it's someone else's problem but it's a

686

me take the second one first I think the

00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:08,010
DC Circuit and judge table did the FCC

714
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,370
and the United States a tremendous

715
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:14,970
service in setting out a roadmap and a

logically coherent roadmap at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

what the FCC should do and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SEC</font>

718
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:25,560
finally followed that roadmap so I my

money<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on that this will be upheld in</font>

723
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:38,910
you'll have judge Scalia who's looking

for a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple clear approach to</font>

727
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,940
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's clear enough for him he's</font>

got his transport element as a separate

element as to private peering

730
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:59,480
and chairman wheeler said in the last

743
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,009
to reach I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point when</font>

744
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:44,359
the FCC will step in I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if</font>

that answers your question but well you

FCC talks about broadband or the Public

768

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually mean broadband instead of the</font>

friends when they talk about broadband

777
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:31,810
they're talking about minimum 100 Meg up

778
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:34,060
down unfiltered last mile it right

779
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:37,600
that's the old you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out in</font>

780
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:41,440
you know like rural Japan the new stuff

781
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:43,089
is a little faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and so when</font>

785
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:54,550
they say we've got this deal for you we

hundred and thirty-five bucks a month

such a deal and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I I don't I don't</font>

790
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:08,710

791
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:12,880
that's price competitive and I just it's

00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">really it just it makes me snicker so</font>

can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get broadband you know do you</font>

794
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:21,730
think broadband is going to change well

795
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:26,560
well the FCC just redefined it upward<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

796
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:33,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">25 Meg's down that probably wouldn't</font>

797
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:35,080
satisfy you but but a lot of people are

798
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,820
complaining that that's unrealistic and

799
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:46,110
people don't need 25 megabytes and

800

803
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:01,960
on what you suggest but yes there are

804
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:04,780
people out there who say we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

to a Giga bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep big of gigabyte</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in that direction it might be slower</font>

you gave not the presentation by the way

thank you very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much thank you talking</font>

815
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,320
directly about interconnection you

816
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:37,779
mentioned during one of your answers

817
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,940
that if the consumer is harmed then

818
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,950
inter connection might be there I was

819
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:43,180
worried in this I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking for a</font>

820
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:45,310
little clarification I was worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

821
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,950
the order would actually be as long as

822
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:50,320
things are agnostic or even handed

823
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:52,118
across all comers then it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

824
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,590
no matter what the rule was what you're

825
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:55,690
saying that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the FCC will actually look</font>

00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:58,119
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the consumer and just to give a</font>

slight bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of context for many years for</font>

828
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:02,170
decades actually on the internet it has

829
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:04,029
been common for a carrier that believe

830
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:06,190
either has or believes it has market

whatever is behind them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

even-handed everyone has to do the exact

00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:25,510
same thing is the FCC going to look at

840
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:27,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go no that's not correct and</font>

841
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:28,780
then what are they<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do are they</font>

842
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,880
going to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's a reasonable</font>

843
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,369
price or you have to have settlement

free to the ones above a certain size or

845
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:39,609
I mean that seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a hard problem to</font>

me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve well it's in a really</font>

content providers but visa V what is

856
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:13,800
possible it just that strikes me as a

857
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:15,630
unfair business practice in and of

858
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,030
itself what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> described and I'd</font>

actually like to know more about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

and Susan Crawford also talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

forcing consumers to allowing the

company to upsell consumers so if you

864

could contact me<font color="#CCCCCC"> afterward I'd like to</font>

the second half of bills point was price

874
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:08,369
right as to how much bandwidth is good

875
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:10,859
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if God had meant us to</font>

892
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:32,520
that's what Bill means by what we say

here is broadband is BS thank you so to

move this issue in the policy world I

895
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:41,880
again I would ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to send me the</font>

00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:44,070
data on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's very helpful</font>

898
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:49,680
move the issue in the policy world you

899
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:52,680
need studies you need comparisons the

900
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,750
Berkman Institute at Harvard did a study

901
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:58,890
about three or four years ago finding

902
00:46:54,750 --> 00:47:02,040
that in Europe you could get much more

903
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:06,259
speed for many fewer dollars and that

904
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:12,029
study instantly became the target of

905
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:13,830
attacks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their credit they really</font>

906
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:17,580
didn't pull back from their conclusions

907
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:20,160
although they soften them some so and

908
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:23,069
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people out I won't</font>

909
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:26,970
mention any names making on the circuit

910
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:28,500
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> European us comparisons show</font>

911
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:32,250
that we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> just fine and the</font>

912
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:36,630
market<font color="#E5E5E5"> is working just fine so we do</font>

913
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:38,730
need good comparisons and my own

914
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:42,990
thumbnail comparison I have a friend in

915
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:50,120
Hamburg who gets 427 euros voice and 10

916
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:54,209
to 15 megabytes megabits whatever that I

917
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:56,850
and I mean compare what you would pay

918
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:59,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that in the United States similarly</font>

919
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:02,839
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> acquaintances in London who even</font>

920
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:05,370
less than that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we need good</font>

921
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:11,500
cross-country comparisons to drive that

922
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:13,150
discussion a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of money I</font>

923
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,260
presenting the university<font color="#CCCCCC"> of colorado</font>

924
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:19,360
boulder in the college merchant program

925
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:21,310
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm primarily a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tech student trying</font>

926
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:23,440
to understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> intricacies of policy</font>

927
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:28,090
so forgive me if my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question sounds</font>

928
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:31,570
stupid so if you have CC the only body

929
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:33,130
that regulates the rulings of paint

930
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:36,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">browsers prioritization and</font>

931
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:39,130
non-discrimination if yes then do you

932
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:42,340
think the FCC is equipped with enough

933
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:44,830
resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect and regulate any</font>

934
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:47,920
infringement or in discussions that

935
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:51,730
might occur you<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked two very good</font>

936
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:54,940
questions one the Federal Trade

937
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:59,680
Commission has some jurisdiction in this

938
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:02,050
area but they do not due to a long

939
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,169
outdated law have jurisdiction over

940
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:06,730
common carriers and that needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font>

941
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:08,590
Commissioner wheeler is I think

942
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,760
dedicated to working with the Federal

943
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:14,920
Trade Commission and bringing their

944
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:17,680
expertise on board so very good question

945
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:20,800
and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your second question the</font>

946
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:25,120
weather the FCC has sufficient resources

947
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:29,320
I think my<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer what from what I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

948
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:31,359
gather on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> west coast here is no they</font>

949
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:35,730
don't they have one administrative law

950
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:39,160
judge if they are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

951
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:41,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">elaborate through a series on a</font>

952
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">case-by-case basis which is what they</font>

953
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:45,850
say they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need more</font>

954
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:49,089
administrative law judges more capacity

955
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:52,360
to do dispute resolution than they

956
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:58,770
currently have does that answer your

957
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:58,770
question yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you time</font>

958
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,750
thank you very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

959
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:10,550
thanks very much Chris
