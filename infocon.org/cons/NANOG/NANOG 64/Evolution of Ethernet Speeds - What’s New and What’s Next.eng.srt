00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:10,710
gross so in terms of

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,040
rest of the day we've got only a couple

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font>

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,640
technical talks left and then just some

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,860
closing remarks by our executive

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,650
director and so we're running slightly

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:25,099
behind but if anyone can go fast it's

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,750
greg<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hankins who's going to tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us what</font>

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,930
this opening slide before but I wanted

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to bring it back because I look at it</font>

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,359
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this turns out this diagram was</font>

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,039
drawn 42 years ago and I'm always a kind

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,620
just saw I think it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cool to</font>

different speeds that we've added<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about market</font>

31
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,860
evolution and then what's next<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

32
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,440
what's new for some of the various

33
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,660
different speeds if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">market requirements we've had fairly</font>

35
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,920
linear increases in Ethernet speeds but

36
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,690
now we're seeing different requirements

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,840
for different applications in terms of

38
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:36,390

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,980
constraints for example so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out</font>

40
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,200
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a lot of different new</font>

41
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,520
speeds we have the potential to do six

new speeds in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next couple years</font>

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,570
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same amount that we've done</font>

44
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the past 30 years but there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that so it may look a little</font>

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,480
chaotic it may look like we're a little

47
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,830
bit exuberant over different speeds but

48
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,320
there's good reasons why we're doing

49
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,550
these so for wireless access points

50
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,679
we're looking at two and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> half and five</font>

51
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,960
gig for server applications we're

52
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,290
looking at 25 gig and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for core networks</font>

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,419
we're looking at doing four hundred gig

54
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:08,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of the market applications 10 gig</font>

55
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,949
is obviously very widely deployed so

56
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,129
et/10 get deployed everywhere working on

57
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:16,560
new applications for two and a half and

58
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:18,540
five big again driven primarily by the

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,299
requirement for<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher wireless access</font>

60

cat5

62
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,390
and cat6 for data center access and

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,090
server<font color="#CCCCCC"> nicks we're working on 25 gig or</font>

64
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,100
to have more interfaces for 40 and 100

65
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,350
gig<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about and then also</font>

66
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,100
we're working on 400 gig for core

67
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:39,960
applications as I mentioned let's start

68
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at the market drivers for two</font>

69
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,860
and a half and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and five gig in</font>

70
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,420
particular we have a number of wireless

71
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,000
access point speeds that are now

72
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,730
exceeding the wired capacity so we have

73
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,560
for example attitude 11ac can go to

74
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,140
about seven gigs but you only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,790
gigabit wired link that goes back into

76
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,309
the rest your network and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

77
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,310
couple years going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have 80 to 211 ax</font>

78
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:05,310
which has potential to go to four<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

79
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,280
faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 11 AC so clearly we need</font>

80
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,080
some sort of faster wireless backhaul on

81
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,370
the on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wired side to avoid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,660
bottlenecks the rule<font color="#CCCCCC"> of thumb is that</font>

83
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:17,220
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 75% wire speed to to</font>

84
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,959
avoid the bottleneck so clearly that

85
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,700
kind of you can see the math works out

86
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need two and a half gig and five</font>

87
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:26,160
gig that runs over cat5 and cat6 and

88
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">then of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we need p 0 e as well to</font>

89
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,359
power those access points the other

90
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,820
market driver for two and a half and

91
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,209
five gig is a very large installed base

92
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,370
of cat5e and cat6 so we have higher

93
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:42,269
speeds we have 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> g base t that only</font>

94
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,130
runs over<font color="#CCCCCC"> cat6a or cat6 we have 25</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> g</font>

95
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,590
base t and 40 g base to you that we're

96
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:50,250
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that requires cat ate only</font>

97
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:52,290
goes to 30 meters so there is a desire

98
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,200
to reuse a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of existing</font>

99
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,239
infrastructure for higher speeds the I

100
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,220
Triple E references a study that's shown

101
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,549
here I'll just tie you see numbers just

102
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:05,430
in 2014 for example 58 billion<font color="#E5E5E5"> meters of</font>

103
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:07,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">cat5 was sold worldwide this translates</font>

104
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,600
to about ninety percent of the installed

105
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,670
outlets the very interesting thing is

106
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,040
that data centers only make up about

107
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,620
four percent of that installed base so

108
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,978
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about every hotel conference</font>

113
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,860
that's where the the largest all bait is

114
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,948
that we

for a higher speed desktops<font color="#E5E5E5"> small cell</font>

the I Triple E has a new task force is

122
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:55,879
called 8023 BZ it was just formed a

123
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,379
couple months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago they had their first</font>

124
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:59,599
meeting three weeks ago so there's not

125
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:01,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a whole lot to report yet they're</font>

126
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:04,310
going to define three new speeds<font color="#CCCCCC"> two and</font>

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:07,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">a half gig over 100 meter cat 55 gig</font>

129
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:12,378
gig over 100 meter cat6 it's going to

130
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:14,270
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of auto negotiation</font>

131
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:17,360
between the different based ease so we

132
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:20,270
have two and a half 5 10 25 and 40<font color="#CCCCCC"> G</font>

base Tino and they're working on the

134
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:25,639
first draft so again not a whole lot to

135
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,378
report<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet the standard and interfaces</font>

136
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,319
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> available sometime on the</font>

137
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:32,360
market and about 2016 sometime next year

138
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,240
there's two industry groups that are

139
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,580
also working to define standards and

140
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,949

a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the new optical</font>

171

to support<font color="#CCCCCC"> undergear qsfp 28 to SF p28</font>

174
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,460
what about 40 gig wasn't this whole

175
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,860
thing in the I Triple E and all this and

176
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,840
that and arguing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and turns out yes there</font>

177
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,760
was we ended up<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing 40 gig but</font>

178
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,770
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the I mean the</font>

179
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,990
standard was defined in 2010 we were

180
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,000
working on the specification in 2008 so

181
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,330
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the market</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements</font>

182
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,480
have changed over those years so back

183
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,700
then 10 gig<font color="#E5E5E5"> signaling was efficient now</font>

184
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,620
25 gig signaling is more efficient so

185
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,260
it's kind of evolved and what we can

186
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:21,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">support the qsfp+ is also more expensive</font>

187
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,849
than the SF b 28 and kind of a theme

188
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">through this presentation is there's</font>

189
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,750
there's a need for both there's a need

190
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,810
for 40 gig there's a need for 25 gig in

191
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,930
the data center here's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> matthew slide</font>

192
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,910
that shows you two different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways how 25</font>

193
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">gigs signaling is much more efficient</font>

194
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:40,130
and you know there's a bunch of well

195
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,270
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of 3.2 terabit chips</font>

196
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,770
that are coming on the market you've

197
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,140
probably heard of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Broadcom's tomahawk</font>

198
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,000
and this fall and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i expect early next</font>

199
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,469
year there's going to be a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of new</font>

200
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,780
switches and new line cards in the

201
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,419
market they're going to have 3.2 terabit

202
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:56,270
capacity so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a theoretical</font>

203
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:59,539
switch for example could support 96 25

204
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:02,090
big links and 408<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 gig up</font>

205
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,220
links has a full capacity utilization of

206
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,310
3.2 terabits if we had to do that with

207
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:10,550
with 10 gig signaling and using 40 gig

208
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,260
then we would get much less capacity and

209
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">the interesting thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you should just</font>

210
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,550
use an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a hundred thousand</font>

213
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,849

214

218
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,360
25 big signaling is the most efficient

219
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:40,450
and that's the one that gives us full

220
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,450
utilization of the the 3.2 terrible chip

221

the 25<font color="#CCCCCC"> gigabit ethernet consortium that</font>

254
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:00,290
was founded last year by a few vendors

00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:01,490
they are developing 25 and 50 gig

256
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,829
standards that are outside of the I

257

Triple E they're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a 25 gig</font>

258
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:09,349
interface and also a 50 gig interface

259
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:12,800
the specification on their web pages is

260
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:14,240
worded very distinctly and says that

261
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,130
they're only going to define backplane

262
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,279
and twinax copper cable but does not

263

address or preclude active<font color="#E5E5E5"> offered cable</font>

264
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,750
or fiber interfaces I don't know what

00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:26,239
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means unfortunately the full draft</font>

266
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,440

271
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:39,800
expect this means is that the itrip lead

will define<font color="#CCCCCC"> the copper and multimode</font>

00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:12,049
for 25 gig there's an sfp 28 it's just a

319
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:35,569
through ok on to 100 gig and this is

320
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:37,339
where it's interesting and probably

321
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:40,368
worth a little spending a little more

322
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:42,499
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this slide we're finally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

323
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:44,989
if you ever heard of crossing the chasm

324
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:46,549
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a marketing book that talks</font>

325
00:12:44,989 --> 00:12:48,259
about technology adoption and the cool

326
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:51,319
thing is that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it applies to</font>

327
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:53,779
anything in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world and to as you may</font>

328
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:55,789
remember from your statistics class it

329
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:57,769
turns out everything's a bell curve at

330
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:59,659
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other day so those two things</font>

331
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:01,759
together can describe how the market

332
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:03,409
adopts any new technology and it has

333
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,689
these concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> of innovators early</font>

334
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:08,749
adopters really majority and then that

335
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:10,519
also relates to market volume so the

336
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:12,169
interesting thing about hunter gig is

337
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:14,959
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> finally crossing this</font>

00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:23,910
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> driving that are this 3.2</font>

and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> to new optics types the QSF e28</font>

00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cfp for del Oro project still</font>

346
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,929
arose a market research group they

347
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,849
project that we're going to ship a

348
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:41,069
million<font color="#CCCCCC"> hunter gig ports next year in</font>

349
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:43,170
2014 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market volume was seventeen</font>

350
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:44,969
thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> hunter gig ports so you can see</font>

351
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,248
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a pretty big increase in</font>

352
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,439
hundred gig ports and again driven

353
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:51,929
primarily by the the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> a6 and the new</font>

354
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:55,199
optics that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have on the market and</font>

355
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:57,569
then eventually you know in 2018 2020

356
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,849
whatever when we have cereal 100 gig

357
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:04,349
then you know we'll have high density

358
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:05,429
commodity ports like we have today so

359
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,069
you have probably seen this slide before

360
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:09,899
so i'll just talk quickly through it but

361
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:11,219
it goes back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was saying about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

362
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,369
first generation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred gig</font>

363
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,959
technology use 10 gig signaling on the

364
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:17,999
electrical in the optical side the

365
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:20,008
second generation we get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the</font>

366
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:21,540
10 gig and we go straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 25 gigs</font>

367
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:23,879
signaling that gives us a lot more

368
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:26,399
efficiency and allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to develop</font>

369
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:28,589
smaller optics modules terms 100 gig

370
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,769
development there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot going on</font>

371
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:33,809
the I Triple E<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a short reach and</font>

372
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:35,850
sr4 interface that was defined and

373
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:37,110
standardized in February and then

374
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,149
there's a couple things that removed

375
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,369
from the standard and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

376
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:43,079
the important ones there's a 20-metre

377
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:44,790
multimode fiber interface that was

378
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:46,589
removed<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because there wasn't a</font>

379
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,569
point we have a hundred meter so there

380
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:50,929
wasn't really a big advantage in doing a

381
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:53,579
20-metre the one that is important is a

382
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:56,819
short reach single mode interface there

383
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:59,059
is a proposal to do a 50 sorry 500 meter

384
00:14:56,819 --> 00:15:01,589
single motor interface to address

385
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:04,559
hyperscale<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you know large-scale data</font>

386
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:06,929
centers where you need to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> faster than</font>

387
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,059
10 gig and longer than 100 meters but

388
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:10,980
there is no you know no intermediate

389
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:13,169
reach other than 10 kilometers which was

390
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,610
pretty expensive unfortunately in the I

391
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:17,339
Triple E people<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't come to</font>

392
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:22,860
consensus so the objectives were removed

393
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:24,389
from from the I Triple E here's just a

394
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,069
couple of slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'll go through</font>

395
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:27,760
quickly on the module evolution you can

396
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:29,979
see on the very end we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Q</font>

397
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">p 28 and CFP for so this is what's</font>

398
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:35,290
getting us that higher density also

399
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:38,710
lower power consumption the qsfp 28 in

400
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:42,400
particular is about 3.5 wats versus the

401
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:44,440
original sfp or<font color="#CCCCCC"> CFP that was 24 wats so</font>

402
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,810
we see quite a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reduction power</font>

403
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,810
requirements and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also of course much</font>

404
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:52,660
higher density here's a couple just

405
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,760
other views I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show this picture</font>

406
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,140
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone has an iphone and you</font>

407
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,110
can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of relate to how big the optics</font>

408
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:01,960
module is but the original<font color="#CCCCCC"> see of port</font>

409
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:04,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">cfp was a very large optic compared to</font>

410
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,810
an iphone 4 and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that each</font>

411
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:12,340

412
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:14,680
reduces that about by half this is where

413
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:17,440
it gets a little crowded and if you

414
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:20,260
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the VHS versus Betamax or you</font>

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,140
know some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> technology choice that</font>

416
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:26,020
we had to face this is like for BHS and

for beta<font color="#CCCCCC"> Max's we had the 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by 10 MSA</font>

419
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,340
early<font color="#CCCCCC"> on for two reasons one they had a</font>

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">two-kilometre interface whereas the I</font>

421

425
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,120
E standards so this was popular early<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

426
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,430
but then since we couldn't reach

427
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,500
consensus in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the I Triple E we have four</font>

other<font color="#CCCCCC"> MSAs that have popped up that are</font>

429
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,210
all doing a short reach single mode

430
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,480
interface and two of them are even doing

431
00:16:55,210 --> 00:17:01,450
a very similar thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> using 13 10</font>

433
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:05,680
so it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be interesting to see</font>

434
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,750
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> these play out there's different</font>

435
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,220
network operators different system

436
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,490
vendors different component vendors

437
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,140
behind all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> MSAs and basically this</font>

438
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,410
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you can decide with your dollars</font>

439
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,300
on which one you would like to support

440
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,220
but clearly the market can't we can't

441
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:24,329
sustain all four of those at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

442
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:27,790
time is a technology reference slide and

443
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:31,000
on to 400 gig this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where it gets</font>

444
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,139
really interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> 441 gig 10 gig even a</font>

445

<font color="#E5E5E5">blinking a light really fast you know</font>

447
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,470
for 10 gig we blink it faster than for

448
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,190
one gig but that's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's</font>

449
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,980
doing

450
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">400 gig gets really complicated because</font>

451
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,810
now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing DSP and all these these</font>

452
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,490
complicated optics modulation schemes

453
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:50,379
because we can't blink the light fast

454
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:52,570
enough basically we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find other</font>

455
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,100
ways to increase the speeds so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

456
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point where are in the I Triple E</font>

457
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,629
and this is what led us to 400 gig

458
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:00,360
because we know ok today Ethernet at

459
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,890
terabit speeds it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really possible</font>

460
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,570
it's technically impractical and

461
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,490
especially economically impractical

462
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,679
meaning if we built it would be really

463
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:11,110
large and clunky and you wouldn't want

464
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">to buy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it we have to balance that with</font>

465
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,399
the requirement<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need terabit</font>

466
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,600
link speeds soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> and core</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> networks so</font>

467
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,850
one way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is link aggregation</font>

468
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,830
which is great the other way to do that

469
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,209
is just by providing a faster link speed

470
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,310
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to balance all these things</font>

471
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:26,050
that on the technology side the form

472
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,270
factor optical<font color="#E5E5E5"> signaling electrical</font>

473
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,250
signaling technical feasibility with the

474
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:32,800
market requirements which can sometimes

475
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,570
be vastly different between a transit

476
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,639
and your internet exchanges broadband

477
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,770
mobile aggregation cloud and data

478
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,690
centers content providers so that's kind

479
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,520
of how we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at things the I</font>

480
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,230
Triple E provides the open<font color="#E5E5E5"> forum where</font>

481
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,910
we make those decisions and then it's

482
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:48,340
all balanced by costs it all comes down

483
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:50,650
to cost so that's what we look at when

484
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,949
we have new speeds 400 gig was chosen

485
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:55,480
because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good speed that</font>

486
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,670
that can give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a reasonable increase</font>

487
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,210
at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost that that people will actually</font>

488
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:03,730
buy so that leads us to the I Triple E

489
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:06,820
task force 802 that<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BS started in</font>

490

<font color="#E5E5E5">March 2014 they're working on a number</font>

491
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:12,370
of different interfaces which only one

492

494
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,350
have some keys new standards that's

495
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:22,300

a 50 gig interface as 40 gigs been very

popular for<font color="#E5E5E5"> break out with strong desire</font>

504
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:49,270
from from 400 gig we expect the standard

505
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,740
in February of 2017 and also probably

506
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:55,389
first interfaces

<font color="#E5E5E5">of Technology considerations this is</font>

509
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,790
where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets hard as I mentioned so</font>

510
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:02,470
there's basically four ways that we can

00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:13,690
us to not a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different choices and</font>

517
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:15,520
in the I Triple E this is where the

518
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,710
discussion is about all these different

519
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,710
encoding schemes and different fibers

520
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:23,590
that we can use so there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> nrz and</font>

532
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:49,090
there's a lot of debate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I Triple</font>

533
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,980
E about what the right thing to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

534
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:53,070
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what the right technology uses</font>

535
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,480
so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things would have to be decided</font>

536
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,500
eventually as they build consensus in

537
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I Triple E and what the right</font>

538
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,420
solution is in terms of optics modules

539
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,280
there's two modules that will be used

540
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:06,280
initially for 400 gig there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

541
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,470
called as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdf p this is a 400 gig</font>

542
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,809
module that was specifically designed

543
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,400
for shorter reach interfaces and then

544
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:14,980
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the cfp too so you might</font>

545
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,960
recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cfp to from 100 gig it was</font>

546
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,200
specification was actually designed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

547
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,330
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> hunter gig and also 400 gig from</font>

548
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,760
the very beginning so it has eight times

<font color="#E5E5E5">50 gig electrical inputs that we can use</font>

550
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:31,270
for for 400 gig and then sometime down

551
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:33,520
the road maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 2020 time frame will</font>

552
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,139
have some sort of new optical module for

553
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,230
400 gig it could be some theoretical

554
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,910
maybe a qsfp a hundred or<font color="#CCCCCC"> cfp for</font>

555
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,550
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that that could actually</font>

556
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:45,010
support hunter gig serial signaling and

00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,750
this is when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet a terabit speeds</font>

have hunter gig electrical and optical

560

a terabit<font color="#CCCCCC"> ethernet ok so if futures kind</font>

on this year some people are shipping it

already we're still a ways of ways from

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,820
100 gig serial signaling but we'll get

604
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:41,039
there eventually 400 gig development is

605
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:43,439
well underway and based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hunter gig</font>

609
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:51,418
it's likely that the next speed increase

could be a 1.6 terabit it's unlikely

that we'll see a one terabit speed

exactly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's still unfeasible right</font>

00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:03,059
economic reasons it's just not feasible

00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:05,519
to make it but we'll get there

616

eventually sometime around<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 20 plus</font>

624
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,910
you can also look at all the optics<font color="#CCCCCC"> MSAs</font>

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,320
they're interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read the</font>

currently buried underground today and

639
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:14,980
start running into the speed limits of

640
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:16,840
of the current way that fiber is is laid

00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">though not so much that's that's a good</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an optical expert but I can tell you</font>

646
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:30,040
that there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge deployment of I</font>

00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:33,490
forgot this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> single-mode</font>

00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:37,240
there's a huge deployment of that fiber

650
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,850
everywhere in the world so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind</font>

of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the common denominator so all of</font>

the current developments are expected to

specialized fiber but I don't I don't

658
00:25:52,840 --> 00:26:00,149
know if about enough about it to answer

659
00:25:54,430 --> 00:26:00,150
that sorry good question though

670
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:31,470
a that's a great question so you'll

that's where it's all patented very

anything there no no nope Phil<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

707
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:13,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question from Phil Phil</font>

708
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,760
Rosenthal from is prime so there's

709
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:20,190
some other discussions in the past about

710
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:22,200
MTU increasing and being a controversial

711
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:25,020
thing and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stuck with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,500</font>

712
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,120
being the standard but that said any

713
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,700
chance that we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get an</font>

714
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,209
auto negotiation where if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I configure</font>

715
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,160
one side as 1500 and other side is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9000</font>

716
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,110
that they'll say hey this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mismatch</font>

717
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,120
and pick this you know the smaller

718
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,740
number that'll actually work yeah so

719
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,870
good good question this probably comes

720
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:45,030
up almost every time I give this

721
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:48,120
presentation and I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I never</font>

722
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:52,530
have a good answer for you but and this

723
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,939
came up at ripe to in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Martin andrew</font>

724
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:56,629
de coeur had a discussion about it

725
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:59,940
there's no interest in the I Triple E on

726
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:02,910
defining some sort of maximum frame size

727
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:05,280
in fact all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standards the first line</font>

728
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,900
is almost always preserve the existing

729
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,178
frame format so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

730
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,160
interest in the I Triple E on

731
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:12,840
maintaining compatibility with the I

732
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know millions or billions of</font>

733
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,889
Ethernet devices out that are out there

734
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,020
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would be very difficult I think</font>

735
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:23,100
to have some sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> odd negotiation</font>

736
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:24,750
thing for a larger MTU size but you know

737
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,428
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where if this is important to</font>

738
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,420
you this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I say all the time and</font>

739
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:29,130
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a very good answer</font>

740
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,620
but it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only answer that I have is</font>

741
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:33,270
if jumbo frames standardization<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

742
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,070
important to you then you need to be

743
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:37,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your system vendors about it</font>

744
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:39,240
and make them do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it in</font>

745
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,280
the Unites rly you guys without a large

746
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,559
demand from from you know you the

747
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,970
customers the network operators no one's

748
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:47,309
interested in doing it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I Triple E</font>

749
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:52,429
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now thank you i'm sorry that's not</font>

750
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:52,428
a very good answer yeah thank you
