88
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,780
because there are many sources

we look at the origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> and closeness</font>

attacks in a region attacks the attacker

93
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,549
announces the prefix of the victim and

94
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,649
does attracts the traffic in the

95
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,989
closeness attacks the attacker claims to

96
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,120
be close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the victim so if he claims</font>

attracts the victims traffic and once he

99
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,660
attracts it he can drop it this is the

<font color="#E5E5E5">black falling attack or he can modify it</font>

101

or sniff it and forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto the victim</font>

102
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,459
that's the interception attack so

103
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,620
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all these attacks we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask what</font>

is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing they have in common and the</font>

105
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,640
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have in common is that they</font>

from the victim's perspective because

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,889
the victim needs to

attack diagnosis and mitigation and we

126
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:17,948
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with the idea of sense this is</font>

130
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:28,389
and it would enable the victim to

00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:30,579
observe its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic we define on</font>

the victim can filter or allow traffic

138

segment so now tell you more details

148
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:15,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works i speedrun sence</font>

149
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:17,558
servers and victims talk to these

150
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:19,869
servers when they are under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack</font>

151
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:21,729
they could discover<font color="#CCCCCC"> the existence of</font>

152
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:25,689
these servers through some public

directory for example through<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns and</font>

154
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:31,029
they when the victim is under attack it

155
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,759
would select which is peace to talk to

156
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:35,889
it would send a query it either about

157
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,759
traffic or about routes receive

158
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:41,529
responses figure out where to act on the

159
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,569
traffic to filter traffic or where to

160
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:44,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">correct routes and then send control</font>

161
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,539
messages

162
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:50,919
that would then be implemented<font color="#CCCCCC"> by ISPs</font>

163
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:54,039
of course all this requires very well

164
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:56,258
thought and foolproof security layer

165
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:58,659
because we don't want people affecting

166
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:00,759
anybody's traffic or routes except their

167
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:03,550
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have mechanisms to ensure</font>

168
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:05,139
that and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP when they received</font>

169
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,689
the request would actually authenticate

170
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:10,479
the request verify the ownership of the

171
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:12,639
prefix and then act on that we also

172
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,498
<font color="#E5E5E5">envisioned that ISPs could charge for</font>

173
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,319
this service so this could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an add-on</font>

174
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:20,229
service they wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do it for</font>

175
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:21,789
free although I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't quite</font>

176
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:23,979

177
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:25,509

178
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:28,628

00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:30,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback on too so we made two key</font>

180
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:33,309
design decisions first was that we

181
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:35,860
wanted is to be implementable today in

182
00:07:33,309 --> 00:07:38,889
today's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP infrastructure so we have</font>

183
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,689
very simple actions in ISPs that can be

184
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,610
done with today's infrastructure and all

185
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:44,319
intelligence resides at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> victim so</font>

186
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,139
the victim collects this information

187
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:52,389
decides what to do and then implement a

188
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:54,669
score control actions of the ISPs this

189
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:57,069
also has the benefit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the victim</font>

190
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:59,318
decides about its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic it routes</font>

191
00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:01,800
so it aligns the ownership of traffic

192
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:04,629
and routes with the control over these

193
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,639
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good because victim there</font>

210
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:50,439
to do is in a very sparse deployment if

211
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:52,599
this if the sense is deployed in key

except<font color="#CCCCCC"> to point out that our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goal was to</font>

224
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:26,680
handle a large variety of attacks

225
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,390
because the techs are relatively

227

to to us the<font color="#E5E5E5"> commercial d-does</font>

242
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:14,710
differences such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> CloudFlare and</font>

00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:17,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">Prolexic and secure BGP so cloudflare</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Prolexic and many similar did those</font>

245
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:23,230

traffic through a CDN like structure

247
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,240
they avoid presence on the internet and

248
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,800
then so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that helps sustain the attack</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they also have proprietary</font>

255
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:47,440

256
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,570
than what sense can do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

257
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,480
works at the header level not at the

258
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:54,340
content level and we made this decision

259
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,350
on purpose because as I said we wanted

260
00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:01,000
it to be deployable in today's network

261

during<font color="#CCCCCC"> spamhaus attacks where they</font>

271

00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:37,430
for some limited amount of time this

276
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,470
created problems for bystanders for

277
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:43,760

279
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,590

296
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,610
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works in</font>

performance inspires deployments people

299
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,020
feel motivated to use it and we believe

300
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,570
that sense is this solution it uses rpki

301
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:47,630
for a region authentication but then the

302
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:49,730
AAS path is not authenticated we just

303
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,800
detect when there are texts that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Miss</font>

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,970
out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can ask about your traffic</font>

00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:38,270
controlling traffic you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask for</font>

traffic to be filtered or allowed you

322
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:42,650
can we originally proposed that you can

323
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:45,350
also ask for bandwidth guarantees

324
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:48,439
listening to the FCC talk I learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

325
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:51,110
this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in line with the</font>

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,320
net neutrality<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we'll we'll be looking</font>

327
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,970
how to fix that but this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a small</font>

328
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">part of sense and it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

329
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">critical we can actually drop that and</font>

330
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,630
then in the route control you can ask

331
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,480
for routes to be demoted if they have a

332
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:07,370

334
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,390
different segment the envision that

335
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,400
sense would be deployed the ties piece

336
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,780
is a web service and we made this

337
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,370
decision because there are a lot of

338
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:19,400
functionalities that web service

339
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,870
currently has that we can leverage for a

340
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,829
botanist we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage your</font>

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:27,530
application solutions to to web services

342
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:30,410
for security we can leverage HTTPS and

343
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:32,600
for if I speeds were to charge<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font>

344
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:35,420
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> leverage e-commerce solutions so</font>

345
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:41,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">people can sign up on demand and start</font>

346
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:44,329
using sense now talk about security

347
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,699
security is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important we don't want</font>

348
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:52,040
people controlling anybody's traffic or

349
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:54,620
out but their own and so we propose<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpk</font>

350
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,579
use of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpki to verify ownership you can</font>

351
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:00,050
only when you send requests for sense

352
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:03,800
services you attach the RPK our

353
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:05,750
certificate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs validated and only</font>

354
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,729
if it's valid they will take actions so

355
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can only affect traffic for your</font>

356
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:14,150
prefixes and routes for your prefixes

357
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:16,610
also to address attacks in the middle we

358
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:19,730
use TLS that's a common for

359
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,470
communication security further victim

360
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,390

00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:27,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it cannot communicate not even with</font>

362
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:29,330
sense maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's prefixes are hijacked</font>

363
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:32,479
so it cannot receive replies from sense

364
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:35,090
and that's bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> because victim needs to</font>

365
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,590
observe in order to learn what to do

366
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,830
with

367
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:40,570
traffic and<font color="#CCCCCC"> routes or it may be solver</font>

368
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,670
around with the DDoS attack that it

369
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:45,760
cannot receive replies again from san

370
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,620
servers what victim can do easily with

371
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,319
sense is offload the victim

372
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,720
functionality to say a cloud in a

373
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,600
different network if the victim prepared

374
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,640
a proxy or several proxies in several

375
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,250
different networks in advance and gave

376
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,730
them the prefix ownership through<font color="#E5E5E5"> router</font>

378
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:10,180
proxies can act on behalf of the victim

379
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,969
when the victim is disabled so now

380
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,219
briefly introduce how we could use sense

381
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,750
to diagnose and mitigate attacks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font>

382
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that these are just</font>

383
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:22,240
examples since api's are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple so</font>

384
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:27,490
you can combine them the customer can

385
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:30,430
combine them in any way<font color="#E5E5E5"> they see fit in</font>

386
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,010

387
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:35,800

00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:37,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> victim would choose the ISPs to</font>

390
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,940

391

395
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,840
signature traffic is coming from

396
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:59,710
everywhere it's hard to separate

397
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:02,790
legitimate from the attack the victim

398
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:06,340
can use sense to identify links between

the neighbors of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cells deploying ISP</font>

404
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,730
candidates for filtering because they

405
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:25,139
are likely to carry most of the attack I

406
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:28,420
will illustrate this with an example

407
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:31,300
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a simple example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a data</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">volume of traffic they received from</font>

there is an attack it queries again it

418

now learns that link<font color="#E5E5E5"> ls2 carries a lot</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">before link JK carries a lot of traffic</font>

whereas previously it carried just a

422
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,690
little and so these are the links that

423

<font color="#CCCCCC">are prime candidates for filtering the</font>

424
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:15,330
next step would be for the victim to ask

00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:19,620
for filters in<font color="#CCCCCC"> L and potentially in j2</font>

426
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:21,600
to filter the attack we have a solution

427
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,090
for reflector attacks that we believe

428

would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to surgically remove the</font>

430
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,210
mostly unhandled today what we propose

431
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,610
is that the victim could net all

432
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,010

441
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,410
then it would send to control messages

447
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,610
attacker can probe and figure out which

448
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:26,130
ports range the victim is using and then

449
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:28,439
focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> it spoofing on that but the victim</font>

450

can dynamically keep changing this range

451
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:36,030
because sense is fully automated in the

453
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:41,610
where the victim victims prefix is

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:44,219
hijacked by the attacker if the attacker

455
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,750
annouce is the prefix rpki takes care of

H is the attacker it announces part hgv

route that has a GV segment to be

504
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:58,080
demoted I'll talk briefly about the

505
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,779
evaluation I was cautioned not to

506
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,149
mention well word simulation in this

507
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:05,539
meeting but unfortunately we we are at

508
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:10,080
the University and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to work with</font>

509
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:11,908
simulations however we also wanted to

510
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer the question how this would do in</font>

511
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:15,840
sparse deployment because that's what we

512
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:18,178
care about if this doesn't do well

513
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,529
with first few adopters<font color="#CCCCCC"> then no one will</font>

a nice level topology from route views

516
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:29,820
we looked at several partial deployment

517
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,580
scenarios what if only a small ISPs

518
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:35,549
deployed this or what if a mix of small

519
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:38,070
ISPs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tier 2 and tier ones reply this</font>

00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in these mixes seventy percent would</font>

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:42,809
be small ISPs<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty-five to thirty</font>

524
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,940

526
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:57,929
fewer 15 times smaller deployment and

527
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:59,428
current deployment of<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpki for some of</font>

528
00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:01,740
these simulations we needed to assume

529
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:03,720
some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the tiger distribution</font>

530
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:07,200
and legitimate traffic distribution and

531
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,570
we used both realistic traces from

532
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">EdgeCast for legitimate traffic and from</font>

534
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:18,270
and we also looked at just random

535
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:21,120
choices of attackers and legitimate

536
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:23,279
clients and all these simulations had

537
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,000
the similar conclusions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just show</font>

anywhere in the internet wants to use

for both direct customers again direct

582
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:13,799
customers have more benefit than remote

it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice for them to sign up</font>

victim and victim is only asking about

the particular ISPs view of the world

lying<font color="#CCCCCC"> cannot really affect us it only</font>

647
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:05,730
increases the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the of the victim</font>

648
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,189
because the victim pays for services

the victim will not make a wrong

652
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:16,379

655
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:23,580
so to conclude our we believe the

656
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:26,100
distributed attacks are not handled well

657
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,980
today the focus today is on sustaining

658
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,860
the attacks but the real fix is dropping

660
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:38,908
have been a hijacked and so we believe

661
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:40,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that sense can help in this regard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

666
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:53,189

would be careful with the term rpki it's
