1
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:13,780
our first presentation this morning is

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:17,550
by Russ white from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erickson and you'll</font>

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,550
be discussing rethinking centralization

4
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,840
so if anybody see me speak before you

5
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:32,230
know how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love podiums just</font>

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,239
awesome thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tony this is your</font>

7
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:36,459
obligatory trigger warning there are

8
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,980
things in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this presentation that might</font>

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,870
get you upset but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's okay I'm used</font>

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:46,180
to that too did anybody bring tomatoes

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay all right good I'm pretty safe then</font>

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:52,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so I'm us why it worked for</font>

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:54,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ericsson right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a old red back you</font>

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,779
probably but<font color="#E5E5E5"> no red back better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than you</font>

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,530
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erickson</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> desserts and even make IP</font>

16
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:01,360
product anybody on an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eriksson router</font>

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:06,340
probably not oh look somebody Oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:09,490
people I'm astounded anyway then you

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:12,610
skip the next slide or their thing up

20
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,990
here here we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so first of</font>

21
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,060
all note well this is an experimental

22
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,679
presentation which means i may change my

23
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,390
mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what i'm talking about in the</font>

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle of the presentation or look like</font>

25
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the dog before it's over with so that's</font>

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
great all right does anybody recognize

27
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:31,539
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I've lived through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this you</font>

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,960
know I started in IT putting vt100

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:41,409
terminal cards in in little Z Nazi 100's

30
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,689
and then I moved up to Z 1 Z<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 48 which</font>

31
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:46,180
is that bottom left-hand bottom one down

32
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:48,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">there and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on and on and on you know</font>

33
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:51,310
we do mainframes then we do Oh Leslie

34
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:54,009
lotus 123 then we do minis and we do SQL

35
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,600
and then we play all these games we have

36
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:57,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">been doing this in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IT industry for a</font>

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,449
very very long time Tony and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I were just</font>

38
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking attorney was just saying that we</font>

39
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,930
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this organizationally as well and I</font>

40
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,398
think we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually doing this in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

41
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,860
control plane as well this presentation

42
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:07,600
is primarily about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> control plane so</font>

43
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,619
why don't we do this first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all we</font>

44
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,539
look around and we say okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

45
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,130
this centralized stuff this polling from

46
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:13,570
the old mainframe days it's really

47
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,129
complected it's really slow it takes

48
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,769
five minutes for somebody to figure out

49
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:19,450
that that vt100 is offline it's a

50
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,340
that thing we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this faster</font>

51
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,160
wouldn't it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cool if we decentralized</font>

52
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,340
and we did something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ooh routing</font>

53
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,810
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it is is ospf</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP we</font>

54
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,940
could do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and decentralize our</font>

55
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,260
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan be really cool and then we</font>

56
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,660
distribute it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we all look at it and</font>

57
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:40,239
go oh my gosh this is really hard

58
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:42,370
routing is not a solvable problem let's

59
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,750
do software-defined networks and open

60
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:47,170
flow and bring it all back into the

61
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:49,030
central center again the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason I</font>

62
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,440
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do this is because we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

63
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,240
whole capex cycle that we're playing

64
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,130
with when you buy a data center you buy

65
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,690
all the links and all the fiber and

66
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,370
everything else and then you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

67
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,530
it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years later you actually use it</font>

68
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,970
to full<font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity and by the time you've</font>

69
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,500
used it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> full capacity you've already</font>

70
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,180
run out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of end of life for all of your</font>

71
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,770
equipment so you actually have this huge

72
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,420
capex waste between what your<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

73
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,120
requirements are and what you're

74
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,470
actually trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do I think there's a</font>

75
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">couple of reasons we play this game</font>

76
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,730
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing in</font>

77
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end I think what we're trying to do</font>

78
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,690
is we're actually trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve</font>

79
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,670
complexity you know the whole cap

80
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:24,270
theorem anybody know what the cap

81
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,470
theorem is right and consistent

82
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,110
available and partition of all the

83
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,540
entire quick cheap and high quality

84
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:35,560
problem that you run into all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

85
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:37,690
little side effects of tearing proofs

86
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,700
that exists in the real world that we

87
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,570
face on a daily basis I think part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

88
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,130
what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do is we're</font>

89
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,200
actually trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve complexity and</font>

90
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,359
there's no silver bullet for<font color="#E5E5E5"> complexity</font>

91
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,060
you know we think that distribute is too

92
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,100
complex so we centralize we think

93
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:55,750
centralizes too complex so we distribute

94
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:57,609
so here is what I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

95
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,620
times there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no silver bullet for</font>

96
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,480
complexity<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that stupid</font>

97
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">pendulum on the bottom of that clock and</font>

98
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,459
we keep centralizing and decentralizing

99
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:08,680
things constantly and it's driving me

100
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:10,360
mad there are several things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the IT</font>

101
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,130
industry driving me mad right now if

102
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,470
anybody reads my blog you'll hear all

103
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,719
about the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> driving me mad</font>

104
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,850
so here's a radical thought has anybody

105
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,180
seen this video<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love this video stop</font>

106
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:26,580
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay stop it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or I'll bury you alive</font>

107
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,580
in a box as he says at the very end

108
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:37,620
see somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wait stop it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

109
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:41,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">driving ourselves nuts we are playing</font>

110
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,010
lots of games with 5980 s88 types of

111
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,900
tunneling<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4,000 different types of</font>

112
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,219
control planes and overlays and all

113
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,070
because we're trying to solve an

114
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:53,040
unsolvable problem complexity can't be

115
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,780
solved you can mitigate it you can live

116
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">with it you can figure out how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

117
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,520
around it but you cannot solve this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

118
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,020
I had somebody tell me the other day

119
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the cap theorem is just an observer</font>

120
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:08,430
theory and I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> perhaps they needed</font>

121
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:10,350
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be under observation so where do we</font>

122
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">go from here I feel like I'm going to MC</font>

123
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,500
Escher drawing right there staircases

124
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,210
everywhere I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out which way</font>

125
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,040
is up I'm just running around doing

126
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,140
stuff so let's think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this how do</font>

127
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,500
we solve this in other parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

128
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,360
network how do we mitigate complexity or

129
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,040
how do we manage complexity and

130
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,450
understand complexity and deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

131
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:34,140
in other parts of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network that's not</font>

132
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:36,090
my dog my dog is at the very end I'll

133
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:38,099
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you when we get there anyway right</font>

134
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:41,179
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do in protocols we layer</font>

135
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:45,780
protocols right we have this infamous

136
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:49,350
seven layer stack the seven layer model

137
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,789
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so far dead and so far out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

138
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:54,060
bounds of useless that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't even</font>

139
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,560
explain it to people anymore anyway but

140
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,030
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> live protocols we layer protocols</font>

141
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,560
because we simplify protocol design

142
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,450
right what we do is we look at it we say

143
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I can create consistent and</font>

144
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,710
understandable<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is and I can split</font>

145
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,630
failure domains by layering protocols

146
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,820
right I can take my protocol and I can

147
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,280
split different things from one another

148
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:13,349
i can divide complexity from complexity

149
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,729
and build things between them here's a

150
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,500
more efficient model for understanding

151
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,870
learning protocols Alan Turing

152
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,250
everybody's Red John days book patterns

153
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">in network architecture but this is the</font>

154
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,560
model he pushes through or he iterates

155
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,419
through this iterative model so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

156
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,210
see there that if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

157
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,220
functions of a protocol are you have

158
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,859
effectively<font color="#E5E5E5"> for things that you're doing</font>

159
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,750
you're doing transport or<font color="#E5E5E5"> marshalling as</font>

160
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,080
we used to call it an SQL days right we

161
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,689
marshal our data

162
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,159
we have multiplex we have error

163
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:43,509
correction and we have flow control

164
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:45,340
those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the four things we effectively</font>

165
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:47,500
do with a protocol those are the for

166
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,869
purposes of a protocol we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

167
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,259
look at this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say okay Ethernet does</font>

168
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,870
transport multiplex data link does error

169
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:59,949
flow control then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> pee does transport</font>

170
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:01,509
multiplex TCP does error flow control so

171
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:02,770
if I actually look at this I can start

172
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:04,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at this and saying what i've</font>

173
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,508
done is i've divided my purposes or what

174
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,068
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm trying to do and i figured</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

175
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:11,440
to divide them up into a way where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

176
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:13,389
have clean api's and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have clean</font>

177
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,719
separation of duties and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've actually</font>

178
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:19,360
separated hop-by-hop and<font color="#E5E5E5"> into end in my</font>

179
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:21,099
network and then when I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTP</font>

180
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I transport all sorts of garbage</font>

181
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:25,659
over HTTP and<font color="#CCCCCC"> PGP and then I just keep</font>

182
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,479
building these layers for no apparent

183
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:32,169
reason other than i can write so that's

184
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,909
basically what we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right wheeler</font>

185
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:35,680
topologies are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been writing about</font>

186
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:39,250
hierarchical network design since the

187
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,449
late 1990s first book I wrote advanced

188
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,389
IP network design was all about

189
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:45,279
hierarchical network design it's a cool

190
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,050
idea doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work in all real</font>

191
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,360
world networks but it's a cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea but</font>

192
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,219
even if you don't do pure hierarchy you

193
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,680
still do some sort of layering at

194
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:55,060
apologies why do we let apologies

195
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,979
because we simplify the problem space

196
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,110
right we take our data center<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it has</font>

197
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:00,669
one set of problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a weigh-in</font>

198
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,830
and has a separate set of problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

199
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:04,659
separate these two things out and ice

200
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,039
break-up the failure domains and I make

201
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:08,259
it easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> troubleshoot within each</font>

202
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,150
failure domain by separating<font color="#E5E5E5"> my purposes</font>

203
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:11,830
in what I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> wheeler lots of other</font>

204
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,650
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we first start</font>

205
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,690
running bgp it was divided my customer

routes from my internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> valance that's</font>

207
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,400
what I cared about we do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot we do</font>

208
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,318
a lot more stuff with bgp today does

209
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,719
anybody think will be soon transporting

210
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:27,819
video / bgp because we've just about

211
00:08:25,719 --> 00:08:30,219
thrown everything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine in the protocol pretty might as</font>

213
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:35,439
well just add video and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it over with</font>

anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the original reason for using</font>

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,559

about these slings flooding remains

00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:51,729
right why do I break up flooding remains

237
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">same set of answers so my real question</font>

238
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,959
this morning is in my experimental

239
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:26,560
presentation is why don't we layer the

240
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:31,209
control plane we have been playing this

241
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:34,180
game for 20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> munch</font>

242
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:37,839
everything together don't we my policy

243
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:44,138
is carried in BGP and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's my</font>

244
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:46,329
spanning tree picture that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's</font>

245
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:50,800
a that's about how i feel about spanning

246
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:53,979
tree so anyway you know we munch our

247
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,859
policy into bgp using communities we

248
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:00,160
munge it into ospf using community type

249
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:02,110
things tags and things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

250
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,730
then yet we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the yet we have the</font>

251
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,260
routing protocol doing fast convergence

252
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,690
and we have the routing protocol doing

253
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,850
shortest path<font color="#CCCCCC"> compact calculations reach</font>

254
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:13,449
ability so we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed reach ability</font>

255
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:16,870
and policy and fast convergence and all

256
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:18,639
these things into<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we and</font>

257
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,380
unlike in the protocol world and the

258
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:21,819
network design world<font color="#E5E5E5"> we always flip</font>

259
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,709
these things up and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

260
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:27,069
layers logically<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> munge them</font>

261
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:28,329
all together so here's my slightly my

262
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:30,189
slightly radical question is why don't

263
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:32,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just layer the control plane right we</font>

264
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,329
have four things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can think of now</font>

265
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,099
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is not a perfect model this</font>

266
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:37,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">is all very experimental and something</font>

267
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:40,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> playing with in my head</font>

268
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,160
and you know I'm actually writing a book

269
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,930
on network complexity right now so I've

270
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,850
been thinking about this a lot is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

271
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,109
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a few things that we that we</font>

272
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">want the control plane did it first of</font>

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">all we want it to handle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an a handle to</font>

274
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:52,360
implement policy we dont<font color="#CCCCCC"> want it to</font>

275
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:54,579
crash we don't want to be spanning tree

276
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,290
we want to calculate reach ability

277
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:57,969
shortest path and we want to be able to

278
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,439
react<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changes in topology those are</font>

279
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,310
the four basic things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I expect it</font>

280
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,959
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what is policy I had a</font>

281
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,520
sliding here that i took<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of Bilbo</font>

282
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,229
holding up

283

<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever is policy but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway so policy</font>

285
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,000
comes in two pieces in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind the first</font>

286
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,530
is data<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane policy which I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not too</font>

288
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:21,240
here to be consistent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and complete data</font>

289
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,589
flame policy is anything which modifies

290
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,140
the handling of a packet hop-by-hop

291
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:28,290
queue depth things like this to control

292
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,670
jitter delay and to do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like deep</font>

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,500
packet inspection stateful packet

295
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,890
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody say fire while I'm going</font>

296
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,330
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> slap them outside the head there's no</font>

297
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:37,650
such thing as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a firewall anymore there's</font>

298
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,270
a bunch of services running on an

299
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:42,900
appliance that you can virtualize out

300
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:47,010
but anyway that's my pet peeves are

301
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,720
broad admit II so anyway deep packet

302
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,100
inspection filtering stay full load

303
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,140
balancing all these things are my data

304
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,780
playing policy so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> control plane</font>

305
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,310
policy so here's an interesting question

306
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,689
what is control plane policy so I've

307
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,369
looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the control plane policy I</font>

308
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,560
can think of and every one of them

309
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,800
shares a single thing or a single single

310
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,229
common thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they do they increase</font>

311
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,599
stretch they take your traffic off the

312
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,430
shortest path or they potentially do<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

313
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">right aggregation what does aggregation</font>

314
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:16,709
do aggregation is actually a control

315
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,480
plane policy it's actually removing

316
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:21,840
reach ability or topology information

317
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,550
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my network so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can make my my my</font>

318
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,170
control plane converge more quickly and

319
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,599
more consistently more predictably

320
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,800
that's a policy solution that's not

321
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,510
something that you're you know you're

322
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,650
breaking up your<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure domains this is</font>

323
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,540
something you do as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of policy</font>

324
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,920
but what does aggregation do on the

325
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,949
other side it actually increases my

326
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,329
stretch so again or it has the potential

327
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,830
to increase my stretch because I have

328
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,900
less routing information that I did

329
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,000

350
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,140
how many of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have ever seen a stop</font>

352
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,660
this right i mean we don't mark traffic

359
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,960
to tell me where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stop signs are I</font>

360
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,870
expect to see the stop signs when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

362
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:00,990
policy is distributed in effect and it's

363
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,870
not carried as part of my reach ability

364
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:07,320
well this gives me<font color="#E5E5E5"> an idea if my policy</font>

365
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:10,110
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the same as my reach ability why</font>

366
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,180
can't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just flip them out why can't I</font>

367
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:15,840
start treating my policy as a separate

368
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:18,660
thing than reach ability now of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

369
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,550
policies going to impact reach ability

370
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,560
that only makes sense because again

371
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,510
control plane policy takes things off

372
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,459
the shortest path so clearly there's a

373
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,590
relationship between these two but

374
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,560
they're not the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I can</font>

375
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:34,080
split these two in my head then maybe I

376
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,900
can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of a way of layering</font>

377
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,420
my control plane and doing the right

378
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,910
thing in the right place<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

379
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:45,959
centralized versus decentralized what

380
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:47,730
works really well centralized a handle

381
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,710
to implement policy is the biggest thing

382
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,450
i have not fail up there but that's a

383
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit questionable in my mind as to</font>

384
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,830
where that falls and the centralized

385
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:58,020
versus decentralized but nonetheless a

386
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:00,180
handled implement policy is definitely

387
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:02,850
something that is much easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to</font>

388
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,199
do centralized this is the whole game

389
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,510
behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> open flow and saw and</font>

390
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,090
software-defined networking is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

391
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:11,490
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to treat all of my reach ability as</font>

392
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:13,140
policy and I want to implement a

393
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,600
centralized controller that rolls out

394
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:20,280
all of my reach ability y'all<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

395
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,250
looking really confused this is I told

396
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,120
you this is very experimental

397
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,680
decentralize what I think worked really

398
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,370
well decentralized is I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

399
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,880
you'll ever be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> beat is is or</font>

400
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,530
ospf or<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP in react</font>

401
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,110
the topology or discovering reach

402
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:37,000
ability just don't think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I</font>

403
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,160
don't think centralized polling systems

404
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,970
will ever be decentralized routing

405
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:45,339
protocols for finding discovering and

406
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,930
advertising reach ability very very

407
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,090
quickly in a way that makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

408
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:53,109
network so here's my experimental

409
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:55,030
proposal following on<font color="#CCCCCC"> de lower layer</font>

410
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:57,130
determines my reach ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> reacts to</font>

411
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:58,660
topology change my upper layer hides

412
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,040
information engineers traffic and

413
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,209
traffic flow and then I have an

414
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,849
alternate layer which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my business</font>

415
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:05,650
logic which actually interacts with my

416
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,930
hiding information and my control plane

417
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:09,790
policy so if I can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font>

418
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,800
through this way I can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

419
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,480
about where does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it make sense and by</font>

420
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,040
the way you'll notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have domain one</font>

421
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,200
domain to domain three<font color="#CCCCCC"> drained off</font>

424
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:25,120
things that IP and TCP do but it does it

in a different domain Ethernet does it

427
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:36,070
here's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> second kind of experimental</font>

428
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:38,140
proposal consider each slice of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

429
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,660
network in terms of problem bounding and

00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:43,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">ap is the right solution might very end</font>

431
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,930
to end right in my data center it might

432
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,430
make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> too because my data center</font>

433
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:51,579
probably across<font color="#E5E5E5"> my fabric particularly</font>

434
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:53,459
in the overlay is probably very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

435
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,550
centered on policy and service training

436
00:16:53,460 --> 00:17:00,970
so really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I might want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to conflate my</font>

437
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:04,540
policy with my reach ability in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data</font>

438
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:06,939

push policy across a<font color="#E5E5E5"> s boundaries so I'm</font>

444
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,120
probably going to carry my policy within

445
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,740
my routing protocol within the core<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

446
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,800
could actually think about splitting my

447
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,270
policy in my reach ability since this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

448
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,730
kind of a strange proposal but I

449
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:31,870
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it makes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once</font>

450
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:34,060
you look at how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can put these things</font>

451
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,739
together and think through what the

452
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,750
control planes actually responsible for

453
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,730
and what it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing you might be able to</font>

454
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,590
divide these functions up and do the

455
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">right thing in the right place so</font>

456
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,290
whether by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

Tony I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really early but that's</font>

00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:53,928
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> now he doesn't care good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

459
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:55,250
so weather here is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing first</font>

460
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:58,000
of all we got to learn to ask hard

461
00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:00,200
questions we're network engineers and

462
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,760
engineers ask hard questions and figure

463
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,440
out hard solutions or figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to</font>

464
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,020
manage the solutions in a way that makes

465
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first of all would we really be</font>

466
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:11,660
better off troubleshooting an API than

467
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,770
in distributed protocol this is actually

468
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,750
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need to ask them</font>

469
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,400
whenever we centralize anything is where

470
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,570
does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have an API to the</font>

471
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,760
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and where does it make sense to</font>

472
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:24,230
have a protocol they're different things

473
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:26,090
and we're thinking in terms of coders

474
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,620
are so good<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they've solved all the</font>

475
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:31,570
world's problems and they can slice

476
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:34,729
bread so we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it all an API</font>

477
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,740
I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really works so in</font>

484
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:56,689
whatever it is polling does not beat

485
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,490
local reaction in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world of</font>

486
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,130
philosophy we call this the<font color="#E5E5E5"> subsidiary</font>

487
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:03,830
principle but that's basically what you

488
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:05,450
run into should policy always or ever be

489
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,100
expressed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of forwarding well</font>

490
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:08,840
clearly there is some interaction

491
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,399
between forwarding and policy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

492
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,970
there a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to separate these two things</font>

493
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a way that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense so that i can</font>

494
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:18,080
stop thinking about munging them all

495
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,299
together is there a way for me to

496
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,399
overlay these things that that makes it

497
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:26,030
easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a unified view of the network</font>

498
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,080
actually possible that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty hard</font>

with large-scale networks that we need

time every corner<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it in every area I</font>

heuristics instead of algorithms it just

00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,080
may be the way where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this</font>

510
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,649
failure domains look you know stn is a

511
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:56,750
great thing perhaps and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way you</font>

512
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,550
know I do like sdn for some solution

513
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,990
what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposing here is that we think</font>

514
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:02,030
about where to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> sdn and where to use</font>

515
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,280
distributed control planes in a way that

516
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,570
makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense but if you start thinking</font>

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">about failure domains when I've</font>

00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,960
connected an entire data center through

a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a pair of controllers I've</font>

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:22,910
doing coding you know working in BGP and

00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,380
working in all these other areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a</font>

00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:43,639
ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw away 20 years of</font>

00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,360
ask ok weather should we go community

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,340
action what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do as network</font>

540
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,830
engineers to think through this and

541
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,449
think about how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could logically take</font>

542
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:09,460
these building blocks like Legos and

543
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:11,690
build something useful out of them I

544
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,890
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> say you know vendors are in the</font>

545
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">rope business you can either build a</font>

00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,710
hangman's noose or you can build a

547
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,909
signal tower it's entirely up to you

548
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:21,530
rope is rope so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the rope</font>

00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:23,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we've been given and build a signal</font>

think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is if we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font>

through in our own networks since I

00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:35,630
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a network that means you I</font>

554
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:37,370
guess but anyway think through policy

555
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,170
what do we mean by policy what are we

<font color="#E5E5E5">push back on the vendors and say look we</font>

each other rather than just assuming

words and our yang is the favorite thing

567
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,490
of everybody to hate right now and

568
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:09,110
that's fine I to RS but think about

569
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:14,840
Stanton ways of pushing look the reason

570
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:16,909
if yang fails to unify the user

571
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,889
interface or the interface in a

572
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:21,350
programmatic way across a large number

573
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:23,720
of devices The Fault doesn't lie with

574
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:25,790
the vendors as much as we might all like

575
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,440
to yell at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendors about it it lies</font>

576
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:29,928
with everybody sitting in this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

577
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,400
every other nog in the world it's

578
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:33,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we're not pushing the vendors</font>

579
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,630
and I say that as a vendor by the way

580
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:38,090
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not pushing the vendors enough to</font>

581
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:40,340
say look it's important to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

582
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:42,860
programmatic interface that allows me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

583
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:47,330
overlay into my network and do the right

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my other pet peeves for this morning</font>

586
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,210
think about existing protocols for

southbound could you use pc<font color="#CCCCCC"> EP we're</font>

590
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,860
just as a traffic engineering thing but

591
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:02,030
as a way to do label stacking for things

592
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,370
like service chaining it's an

interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what are the gaps what</font>

thanks a lot Russ next up we have oh we

00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,170
up question

621
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:27,750
hey Russ sorry sir Dave Meyer brocade

622
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:29,610
you go um I guess as you know I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

623
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,190
doing a lot of work in this area<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

624
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,840
the last couple of decades and they have

625
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:37,200
you been an inspiration to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me for that</font>

626
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,399
by the way thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you um one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

627
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things i wanted to mention here is</font>

628
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,630
um the way you talked about complexity

629
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:46,260
is the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we always talk about it</font>

630
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:48,750
as if it's a bad thing and we've really

631
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:51,360
worked on um trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tease that apart</font>

632
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:53,549
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've got to this idea</font>

633
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,350
where so the bottom line here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you</font>

634
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:57,000
want to have robustness which we all

635
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,830
want which you are talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in the</font>

636
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,169
latter part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time you have to</font>

637
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,970
have complexity to achieve that yep it's

638
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:05,880
the gratuitous complexity that you don't

639
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:07,440
want right so complexity itself is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

640
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:12,120
inherently bad in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact it's how you</font>

641
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,880
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's a consequence of trying</font>

642
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,139
to build robustness in these systems

643
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,910
it's thicker to it as part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it that</font>

644
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't want yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completely agree and</font>

645
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if we if we think</font>

646
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,410
about what we're actually trying to

647
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,990
solve and divide it into pieces we might

648
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,580
actually be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a way to</font>

649
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:28,410
to be complete the right level of

650
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:30,330
complexity and not too much and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to</font>

651
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,950
them yeah so you know we've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

652
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,699
quantify that a little bit in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

653
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:37,410
where it sits today is that you try to

654
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,929
understand what complexity is adding

655
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,700
robustness and what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't right and</font>

656
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:43,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's that's a hard problem and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

657
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,559
you're pointing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the other thing</font>

658
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:48,090
I wanted to mention was um the

659
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,149
discussion we had about layering was

660
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:55,230
really pretty pretty on target I'm

661
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:58,260
actually layering is actually one of the

662
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:00,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">ways that you build the good kind of</font>

663
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:03,179
complexity right yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

664
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:05,428
can you can separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> an abstract right</font>

665
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:08,160
it's a wasp place model of IP from

666
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:10,559
original right right that's right thank

667
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,049
you go ahead Tony Tony's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to throw</font>

668
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,590
tomatoes i don't know i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going</font>

669
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:19,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to encourage you to also think about dns</font>

670
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:21,209
and and traffic steering and people sort

671
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:24,059
of moving things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know to where they</font>

672
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,830
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the control so you know if if</font>

673
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,149
somebody wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build I don't know if</font>

674
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,460
you

675
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,830
heard the top from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook the other</font>

676
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:34,250
day or it remarks about how they built a

677
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:36,230
shim layer to my mom you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

678
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,640
control you know have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a better control</font>

679
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,970
user experience I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

680
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:43,820
be discussed coming up but you know it

681
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:46,310
it's not just complexity it's also

682
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,510
control you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when some part you can</font>

683
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,860
control versus what somebody else

684
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,780
controls or what's beyond your control

685
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,030
so this really comes down to policy

686
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:54,710
dispersion right do you want your policy

687
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,060
dispersed throughout your network or do

688
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,280
you want to control<font color="#E5E5E5"> your policy</font>

689
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:00,860
centrally and try to centralize the

690
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,570
policy right and then then you get into

691
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,780
policy surrogates and that's another

692
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:12,100
entire craziness yep but I great good

693
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:15,530
point now they come rushing to the mics

694
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:17,980
no no okay I we're done cool thank you
