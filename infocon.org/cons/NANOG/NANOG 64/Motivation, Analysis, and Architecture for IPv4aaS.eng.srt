1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:10,000
okay good morning everyone

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,599
some thinking that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing with in</font>

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,770
Comcast's related to ipv4<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a service</font>

4
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:19,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm not sure if that's a term</font>

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,890
everyone's familiar with so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

6
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:22,450
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real quick definition because</font>

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,460
that'll put into context kind of the

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,829
rest of the talk kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,890
thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is potentially</font>

10
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:32,590
running ipv4 as an overlay service on

11
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,880
top of an ipv6 underlay network and we

12
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's a number of reasons for</font>

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing that I'm going to share with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

14
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,649
the motivations from why you might want

15
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:40,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do that and then give you some</font>

16
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:42,670
analysis that we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the v4 space</font>

17
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,710
that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of details how v4 is being</font>

18
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,460
used in our network today and then i'm

19
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,870
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to i'm going to give you an</font>

20
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,309
architecture that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on here</font>

21
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would allow us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of you know</font>

22
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:54,039
in run a v4 overlay on top of a v6

23
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,109
infrastructure and you know listening to

24
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,909
russ's talk earlier today it seems like

25
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:59,559
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of in</font>

26
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:00,699
parallel to what is what Russ is saying

27
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,288
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're basically running a</font>

28
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:03,519
control plane on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> another control</font>

29
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:11,590
plane we think there may be some value

30
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:13,020
in terms of doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that let's see I</font>

31
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:17,590
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> had problems with these things</font>

32
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,789
green<font color="#E5E5E5"> one green one thank you all right</font>

33
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,439
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start off with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

34
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,030
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> highly scientific graph here</font>

35
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:24,189
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically shows you know the</font>

36
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,290
relationship between v4 and v6 traffic

37
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:28,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet work today and clearly we're</font>

38
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:30,219
way on the left hand side of this right

39
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,860
where we've got significantly more view

40
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:34,899
for traffic than v6 traffic but at some

41
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,729
point at some point in the future you

42
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:39,820
know we will transition<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we'll have</font>

43
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:41,140
more v6 trafficked in v4<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what</font>

44
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,699
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to do is you're trying to</font>

45
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what might our</font>

46
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,570
network one what might we want our

47
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:48,219
network to look like after we've

48
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,770
transitioned to where there's more v6

49
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:53,380
traffic than v4 do we want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

50
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,158
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same or can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do some optimizations</font>

51
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,219
can we start<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about</font>

52
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,810
optimizations today so that you know as

53
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:00,908
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask our vendors for new features and</font>

54
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,219
whatnot or less features that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

55
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:04,539
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> setting ourselves up for where</font>

56
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:05,979
we're going to be post that transition

57
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:07,479
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about you</font>

58
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:09,070
know you know what is our network

59
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:10,720
ecosystem going to look like or you know

60
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,980
you know what's what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right way to</font>

61
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,590
build networks you know when there's

62
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,420
more v6 traffic than v4<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so kind of</font>

63
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,310
you know we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this before</font>

64
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,379
where we've had protocols that were

65
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,690
deployed everywhere that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you know</font>

66
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:24,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically gone away you know I've listed</font>

67
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,630
a few of them here maybe see LNS should

68
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,670
be

69
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,380
included as well but you know we're kind

70
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">of going through this evolutionary you</font>

71
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,160
know sequence where we've had protocols

72
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,260
that have been predominant over time get

73
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,150
subsumed or replaced by other protocols

74
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,160
and we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing is going to</font>

75
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,050
happen for v4<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm not suggesting v4</font>

76
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,850
is going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> away completely but what</font>

77
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,650
I'm saying is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we may be able to or</font>

78
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,690
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make sense to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

79
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">about you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what our network should</font>

80
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,960
work or how they should work and what

81
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,980
they should look like you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

82
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,690
point where there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of you six</font>

83
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,340
traffic than view<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 ok so kind of what</font>

84
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,280
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what we're thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

85
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,470
you know building or driving towards a

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,270
v6 optimized network and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

87
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,010
the thinking here is that you know we're

88
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,630
not going to be you know lifting Oliver

89
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:08,519
view for traffic on top of a v6

90
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,100
infrastructure today but in the future

91
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,390
what might that look like is I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

92
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give you a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of concepts here to</font>

93
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,910
give you an idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> as to how we think</font>

94
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,980
we're going to baby step in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> general</font>

95
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,900
direction the first one is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> concept</font>

96
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a lean core and so you can think of</font>

97
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,990
it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a network where it's still</font>

98
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">dual-stack but what you're doing is</font>

99
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:24,750
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce the types of</font>

100
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,610
features<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've got there and</font>

101
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,140
you're reducing the size of the fit we

102
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,880
think there's a value in terms of

103
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,170
eliminating complexity by eliminating

104
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,750
features that you're using and that

105
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's probably some significant cost</font>

106
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,010
savings if we can reduce the size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

107
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,140
FIB right today we buy routers with

108
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">millions of entries for fib for v4 and</font>

109
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,459
v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to share with you some data</font>

110
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,350
that basically says we're wasting a lot

111
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,550
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money in that space all right so kind</font>

112
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,870
of we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> ish alee thinking about you</font>

113
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,510
know transitioning or network to this

114
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,980
lean whore sort of concept now there's

115
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,269
another concept here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think some</font>

116
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,030
service providers are going down this

117
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,620
path today where they're basically

118
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,880
driving<font color="#E5E5E5"> their infrastructure to be v6</font>

119
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,680
only right so they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

120
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,540
eliminate v4 all together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then run</font>

121
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,090
before some sort of overlay on top of a

122
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,380
v6 only<font color="#E5E5E5"> network infrastructure we're not</font>

123
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,360
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to we're not trying to get there</font>

124
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,549
right right now but we see value in

125
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,990
going not in that path and then you kind

126
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,610
of think of you know a lean via six

127
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,590
cores kind of being the combination of

128
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the two where it's really geared towards</font>

129
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,399
v6 and you're really gearing towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

130
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,160
reducing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of entries need to</font>

131
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,400
care in your network and again we're

132
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,440
really targeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that first concept this</font>

133
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,640
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lean core sort of concept and</font>

134
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,390
again we think there's really two

135
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,169
primary values that are going to be had

136
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,099
the first is is that if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can eliminate</font>

137
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,270
different types of features<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

138
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,470
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need and if we get the</font>

139
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,880
vendors to kind of eliminate them from

140
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,410
their code train that's going to make

141
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,050
you know that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to eliminate bugs</font>

142
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,030
and make our networks more robust but we

143
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,160
again we think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if we can</font>

144
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">drive towards this model of having a</font>

145
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,270
thin fib having fibs you know on those

146
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,310
86<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are significantly smaller in</font>

147
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,380
size given how we basically build

148
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,840
networks that will reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost of</font>

149
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,890
the memory for those for those a

150
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,570
six-level reduce the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of power</font>

151
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">word putting into them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will reduce</font>

152
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">the amount of heat where we need to cool</font>

153
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">along and whatnot so again we're think</font>

154
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,250
there's a fair amount of value in terms

155
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,810
of moving towards this leaner sort of

156
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,070
architecture and that's kind of like

157
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,530
them to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the next few</font>

158
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,390
minutes and so as you think about moving

159
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,250
down this path you know if we're going

160
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,500
to gear ourselves to try to move towards

161
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,210
more v6 focused and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of a thin fib</font>

162
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,730
sort of architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> but nonetheless we</font>

163
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:28,719
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support v4 you know you know</font>

164
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:32,500
what's the practicality of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

165
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,030
what we did earlier this year is we

166
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,770
basically started doing an analysis of

167
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,659
her network overview for<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and</font>

168
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,000
basically this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> showing us about</font>

169
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,440
five days back in February of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount</font>

170
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">of traffic load on a network the amount</font>

171
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,950
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> E for traffic on your network chances</font>

172
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,390
are you've seen these graphs before you

173
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,310
may dream about them<font color="#E5E5E5"> right this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

174
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,810
kind of classic kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know diurnal</font>

175
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,030
pattern of you know traffic under

176
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,070
networks today now I've had to scrub the

177
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,929
y axis the y-axis basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows how</font>

178
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,030
much load but what I can tell you is the

179
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">y-axis is in terms of terabits a second</font>

180
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,809
and sometimes it's double ditch terabits

181
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,039
per second<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's going to be</font>

182
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,960
important understanding the scale of

183
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,970
this as i talk about subsequent

184
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,409
information here but<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically this is</font>

185
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,180
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the classic profile of how much</font>

186
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,750
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy for how much before</font>

187
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,250
traffic we have in our network today now

188
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,530
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really kind of probably a more</font>

189
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,270
interesting slide for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what we did</font>

190
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,820
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we took the NetFlow data and we</font>

191
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,250
basically asked you know how much

192
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,650
traffic do we have for every v4 prefix

193
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're carrying in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> afib today on the</font>

194
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,760
backbone on<font color="#CCCCCC"> comcast backbone today we</font>

195
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:32,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">have about five hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seventy five</font>

196
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,230
thousand five entries so we're getting

197
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,850
bgp updates from all of our peers doing

198
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:39,390
passed selection<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatnot in a</font>

199
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:42,100
programming<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fit and again it's about</font>

200
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,320
575,000 v4 prefixes in there

201
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">you notice that this graph here which is</font>

202
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,580
basically showing how many prefixes we

203
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">seeing that flow over time the maximum</font>

204
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,210
value there the numbers are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

205
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:55,660
poorly formatted but that that upper

206
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:57,340
bound is a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighty thousand so</font>

207
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,500
what does what the data wasn't

208
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,880
immediately telling us is even though

209
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,710
we're basically carrying all these

210
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,570
routes and all these prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

211
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,130
jamming into these fibs and asking for

212
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,670
millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fib entries from the routing</font>

213
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:12,790
vendors we only only basically send

214
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:16,720
traffic to about 160,000 prefixes today

215
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:19,030
v4 prefixes today so what that means is

216
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,190
about seventy two percent and based on

217
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:23,679
the study back in February two percent

218
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,170
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FIB entries that we're jamming</font>

219
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:31,090
into those asics aren't being used at

220
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:32,590
all seventy-two percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that was</font>

221
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,750
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye opening to us right you know</font>

222
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,859
that we have you know again we're asking

223
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,720
routers to build bigger and bigger

224
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,060
routers with you no more asics for more

225
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,320
more more entries and<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatnot and for</font>

226
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,750
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> part we're not using a</font>

227
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,860
significant portion of them today when

228
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,330
you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know Comcast</font>

229
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,500
might be a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a special case in the</font>

230
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,789
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know were based in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> North</font>

231
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">America and so getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slashed</font>

232
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,870
twenty-fours from<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten or twelve time</font>

233
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,159
zones away maybe it's not surprising you

234
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">know that we have a significant number</font>

235
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,970
of entries that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sending data</font>

236
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,159
to but nonetheless<font color="#CCCCCC"> seventy-two percent</font>

237
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,450
of the entries have no measurable

238
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,630
traffic so it was pretty enlightening

239
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:06,670
for us so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do</font>

240
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,490
is kind of dig in a little bit more deep

241
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:11,080
in a little bit more details as to those

242
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,820
160,000 prefixes those prefixes that

243
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">dean have measurable traffic what do</font>

244
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,719
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a uniform</font>

245
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:19,110
distribution of traffic to the ones i do

246
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,650
have measurable traffic or is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

247
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:25,870
exponential in some way as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

248
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,450
this is detailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as 160,000</font>

249
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,800
prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically think this is</font>

250
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,348
what we effectively did think of you

251
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">know getting 160,000 prefixes where for</font>

252
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,640
every prefix you have a certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount</font>

253
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">of load and sort them you know what you</font>

254
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,059
do is you basically go to the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix</font>

255
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,619
with the most amount of traffic and

256
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:43,239
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> working your way down adding up</font>

257
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,860
the amounts of load until you get the

258
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">number of prefixes that account for</font>

259
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,750
ninety percent of the load okay and so

260
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,839
what that ninety<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent point it means</font>

261
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,240
and that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the number about</font>

262
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">3200 basically what that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is telling us</font>

263
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,510
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the comcast backbone to carry</font>

264
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:04,890
ninety percent of the v4 load I only

265
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:06,839
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3200 prefixes now that's a mix of</font>

266
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">Comcast prefixes and internet prefixes</font>

267
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so the green line basically shows</font>

268
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,240
you know how much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much that is</font>

269
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,520
made up of Comcast prefixes versus

270
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,950
internet prefixes so in order to carry

271
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,870
ninety percent of my v4 load in the

272
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,870
underlay fit but we need about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3200</font>

273
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:25,050
prefixes about 2300 of those who become

274
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:27,600
cows prefixes and about 900 would be

275
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,920
internet prefixes again think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

276
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're buying line cards with</font>

277
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,050
million of entries for fibs and a

278
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,680
significant portion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic Sam</font>

279
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:39,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a very small number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of prefixes</font>

280
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,739
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the ninety percent point so</font>

281
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know if I was going to if I was</font>

282
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,050
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about building</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

283
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">overland and under layer is going to</font>

284
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,740
carry ninety percent in the underlay and

285
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,060
ten percent in the overlay remember that

286
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,320
first slide I showed you that first

287
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,959
graph I showed you where I mentioned

288
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,370
double-digit terabits per second so ten

289
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,140
percent of double-digit terabit per

290
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,660
second still results in terabits per

291
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,730
second so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not quite ready to do</font>

292
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,350
that yet because<font color="#E5E5E5"> again part of what we</font>

293
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,180
want to do here is transition<font color="#E5E5E5"> this into</font>

294
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,070
an overlay that's based on cloud

295
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,380
infrastructure that's a key part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

296
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,720
we want to do here<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look a</font>

297
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,250
little bit further<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the right you know</font>

298
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,560
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we did was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we identify</font>

299
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 99 percent point and again it's the</font>

300
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,489
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of prefixes sorted you know for</font>

301
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,279
most to least and basically identifying

302
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:23,160
how many prefixes carry<font color="#CCCCCC"> 99% of the load</font>

303
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:26,189
and it turns out that you only need

304
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,719
about 26,000 prefixes at least from you

305
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,560
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the comcast view of the world you</font>

306
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,820
only need about 26,000 prefixes to carry

307
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,359
99% of the load in the comcast network

308
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,240
and about six thousand of those of the

309
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,350
26,000 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Comcast prefixes and about</font>

310
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,000
20,000 our internet prefixes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it</font>

311
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,709
seems at least to us that this is pretty

312
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,450
enlightening that again we're building

313
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:49,680
you're asking these vendors for huge

314
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,160
amounts of memory to store huge amounts

315
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,439
of fib entries for v4<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're not</font>

316
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,779
using most of it and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

317
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,760
remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> very first graph which is</font>

318
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,770
basically showing over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that we're</font>

319
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,110
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have more v6 traffic to v4 do</font>

320
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,790
we want to continue going down this path

321
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,380
or can we do things more efficiently so

322
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking is you know maybe we need</font>

323
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,050
to rethink how

324
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:14,770
we're doing our networks here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

325
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,630
I've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of summarized it here again</font>

326
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:20,060
575,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> v four five entries seventy two</font>

327
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,560
seventy two percent don't carry any

328
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,359
traffic at all don't pull any traffic at

329
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">all and then out of the ones that are</font>

330
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,990
pulling traffic you know basically

331
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">ninety-nine percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the traffic load</font>

332
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,890
is identified by about five percent of

333
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,330
the prefixes that we're putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

334
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,500
FIB so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge amount of waste</font>

335
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,780
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thinking of it the</font>

336
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,190
other way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have five hundred and fifty</font>

337
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,189
thousand five hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty nine</font>

338
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand prefixes that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exist that only</font>

339
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:49,070
carry one percent of the load yeah so

340
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:52,340
what we think is<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing ipv4 as a service</font>

341
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,770
is in fact practical today okay maybe

342
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:56,690
not for all v4 but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we can make</font>

343
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,430
a substantial reduction<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the terms in</font>

344
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:01,010
terms of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many entries we need to put</font>

345
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:03,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the FIB by lifting a significant</font>

346
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,630
portion of the v4 prefixes out of the

347
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,920
underlying<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and into an overlay</font>

348
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,350
sort of network that's built on cloud

349
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,610
infrastructure now that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

350
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,020
help us<font color="#E5E5E5"> today right we're ready put</font>

351
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">reverti purchase you know routers that</font>

352
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,620
can handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these five entries and</font>

353
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,240
whatnot but what it can do is allow us

354
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,100
to kind of validate that this approach

355
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,960
makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> approach</font>

356
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,670
scales and it is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact or bus all</font>

357
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is sort of again or to think</font>

358
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,089
russ was hinting at is these overlays of

359
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,550
control clients kind of this is kind of

360
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:30,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're thinking about doing as well</font>

361
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,719
and you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so this this kind</font>

362
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:34,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">of allows us to kind of validate this</font>

363
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,290
approach so that we can go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

364
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,210
vendors and say you know what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

365
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">really like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know a v6 focused</font>

366
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:41,960
platform and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need as much</font>

367
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,910
memory on those line cards because it is

368
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:46,220
practical to build an overlay today and

369
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,079
the other value here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that not only</font>

370
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,810
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it help you send a message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

371
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,820
existing vendors but maybe it also

372
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,439
lowers to bound for new people to get

373
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,150
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the space in terms of building</font>

374
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,740
forwarding infrastructure as well if we

375
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,689
can reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they need to do to</font>

376
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,480
become part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know big service</font>

377
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,740
provider network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

378
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically you know I've given you a</font>

379
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit of motivation here you know</font>

380
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,569
as to why<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we thinking and moving</font>

381
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,880
down to v6 focus network or makes sense

382
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,530
I've giving you some analysis here as to

383
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,150
kind of halvie for you know at least

384
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,189
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our perspective how we see it being</font>

385
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:18,199
used in network today and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

386
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about you know the mechanisms</font>

387
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,910
for you know how we might build an ipv4

388
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:25,110
overland

389
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:26,670
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so many many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different ways</font>

390
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,130
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do this and I'm only going to</font>

391
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about two technologies and these</font>

392
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,189
are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> two technologies that were of</font>

393
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,350
interest to a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of folks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with in</font>

394
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,640
Comcast's in regard and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

395
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">go into detail here because I believe</font>

396
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,930
these these these two technologies have

397
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,790
been talked about both here nanigen IETF

398
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:43,920
and elsewhere in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of detail so I'm</font>

399
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,719
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you about these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

400
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,160
like two distinct ways and when you

401
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about building an overlay an</font>

402
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,230
overlay Network really consists of two

403
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:54,990
pivot points the technology the first is

404
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:57,150
how you do encapsulation so how do you

405
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,680
take in our case a v4 packet and map it

406
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,560
into a v6 packet and so there's

407
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,449
differences between how map map map to

408
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,489
you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisp work in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that sense and so</font>

409
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,200
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the classic way you do</font>

410
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,150
encapsulation and this is the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> mapi</font>

411
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,490
works in the way list works is we take a

412
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,380
v4 packet and you basically totally

413
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:17,640
encapsulate that v4 packet inside of a

414
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:20,040
v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> Packers the visa etc map t works a</font>

415
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,540
little bit differently map t works in

416
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,839
the sense of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it does is it</font>

417
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,510
basically looks at the v4 header and

418
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,830
synthesizes a new visa etc so basically

419
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:31,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">looks in the information the address</font>

420
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,850
fields in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the v4 header and</font>

421
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,830
basically derives what this

422
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,050
corresponding v6 address it should be

423
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,150
and so what's on the wire<font color="#CCCCCC"> for map t is</font>

424
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:41,010
in fact slightly smaller than what you

425
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,810
would see<font color="#E5E5E5"> form a p or less because it's</font>

426
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">not doing full encapsulations basically</font>

427
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:47,430
taking the v4 payload and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's slapping</font>

428
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,530
a v6 head on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it there's no v 4v</font>

429
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,880
four header there so that's kind of that

430
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,160
makes it a map to approach you know

431
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,890
simpler than<font color="#CCCCCC"> mapi or less pin the sense</font>

432
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,880
it's simpler that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's smaller but</font>

433
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,920
encapsulation is just one part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

434
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,780
the other part of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how do you</font>

435
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">determine when you capsulate to pack it</font>

436
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,189
how do you determine where to throw that

437
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,020
packet to what's the end point at which

438
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,330
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send it to and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font>

439
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">is where map the map solutions tend to</font>

440
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,810
be different from<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists the map</font>

441
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,610
solutions tend to be more provisioning

442
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:16,170
based more set of rules that you

443
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,610
basically apply to the border router the

444
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,920
home gateway in advance which basically

445
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:21,540
give it the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> it needs to know</font>

446
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,150
to determine what the remote end point

447
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,230
to send a packet to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lisp and I'm</font>

448
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,230
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I'm going to use a slightly</font>

449
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,550
different term now classic<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisp does</font>

450
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,050
something else where they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

451
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:33,209
control plane that's kind of based on

452
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,279
DNS again i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure if people</font>

453
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,639
familiar with kind of class

454
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:39,470
sick<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisp in the sense of you know it</font>

455
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,170
proposed a mechanism much like DNS where

456
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,579
you do a lookup for a packet or for an

457
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,620
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> to determine you know what the</font>

458
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:47,930
remote endpoint was going to be for so

459
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,550
classic list does this kind of DNS kind

460
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,410
of recursive sort of look up to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

461
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the remote end point in which you</font>

462
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,620
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sending the traffic to and</font>

463
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:56,329
does some caching what not to to make

464
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,240
that efficient some probing to deal with

465
00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:00,559
you new endpoints going way so the two

466
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,480
differences you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know between these</font>

467
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,819
technologies again encapsulation and

468
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,249
what the mechanism is you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using to</font>

469
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:08,809
determine the remote end point to in our

470
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:10,759
case you know we wanted to want to go

471
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:12,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">down the list path we thought let's post</font>

472
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:14,240
a promising path so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest of the talk</font>

473
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:19,339
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lisp</font>

474
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:21,889
solution but with a twist<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we're</font>

475
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:25,339
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lisp encapsulation but we weren't</font>

476
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:26,990
yet ready or comfortable to basically

477
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:29,300
move down the path of changing ratting

478
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:32,059
routing from this push paste routing

479
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:34,189
model to kind of you know a pull based

480
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:36,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">quarry model so what we did was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we took</font>

481
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:38,870
you know our<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisp implementation that we</font>

482
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:41,209
got from<font color="#CCCCCC"> dena wherever he might be and</font>

483
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,790
we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> coupled it together with</font>

484
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:45,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">routing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we're thinking again as</font>

485
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,910
we're using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lisp encapsulation</font>

486
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,379
mechanism but we're still going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

487
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,879
our classic routing sort of paradigm

488
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:51,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">were comfortable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with that and when we</font>

489
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:53,180
think about building this overlay it

490
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:55,730
would be easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do easier to</font>

491
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:57,559
operationalize if we basically kept a

492
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,699
kind of common routing paradigm in place

493
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,600
and so you know our thinking is that

494
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:01,309
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing a lisp</font>

495
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,230
encapsulation but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

496
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:04,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">using classic routing as the means to</font>

497
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,409
kind of program the information that

498
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:10,188
Lisp is going to be using for forwarding

499
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:11,870
information and key here is that you

500
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:13,100
know cloud and<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualization is going</font>

501
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:15,379
to be enabler here you know we're

502
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:17,898
looking to lift this overlay into our

503
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,699
cloud ecosystem and this is going to be

504
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:21,918
enabled<font color="#CCCCCC"> because and this is where we</font>

505
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:24,289
have the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two diagrams here</font>

506
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,309
you know today in the comcast footprint

507
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:26,839
you know we have cloud and

508
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:28,879
virtualization at the national data

509
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,379
center level and now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to</font>

510
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,049
bring it into the high levels of the

511
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,179
regional data center levels we think and

512
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:36,350
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen where</font>

513
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,909
we're going to be pulling cloud and

514
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,469
virtualization basically all the way

515
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:41,600
down into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hub site so down to where</font>

516
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,950
we have the CMT s is located today and

517
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,049
it's the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're pulling this</font>

518
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,430
cloud and virtualization down you know

519
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:48,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">very much to the customer</font>

520
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:51,170
edge that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a blur</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> force</font>

521
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:53,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically bring or instantiate or</font>

522
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,670
begin our ipv4 is a service at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

523
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,929
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so cloud and</font>

524
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,730
virtualization here is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be key</font>

525
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,080
for us and again you know what we're

526
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,970
trying to do is leverage open source as

527
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,159
much as we can and where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't quite</font>

528
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:09,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">have open source you know we're growing</font>

529
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:12,440
our own code as we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to okay so this</font>

530
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,699
is kind of a high level architecture I'm

531
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,250
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into some details in the</font>

532
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,630
subsequent slides here but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

533
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,400
the top you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got you know our</font>

534
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,050
other providers I've got my backbone

535
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,780
where I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> my peering routers and</font>

536
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:25,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatnot and you know my regional</font>

537
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,680
networks my hub routers and CMT s that's

538
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,290
kind of the classic you know under light

539
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,000
infrastructure that's what we have today

540
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:33,530
what we envision doing is you know

541
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,360
having an overlay Network where we're

542
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,649
going to have you know virtual machines

543
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,990
running on that cloud infrastructure

544
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:41,000
tied into you know our peering routers

545
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:44,660
basically at the top of our networks and

546
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,670
then also having two VMs performing Lisp

547
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,830
encapsulation that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very close to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

548
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:52,460
customers down<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the hub site so unless</font>

549
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:54,439
to enlist speak they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be etrs</font>

550
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,690
egress tunnel routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and itrs ingress</font>

551
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,730
tunnel routers kind of again mostly the

552
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,770
analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've done here was based</font>

553
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,540
on showing that a significant number of

554
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:04,850
routes that don't pull traffic or

555
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet routes and so we're thinking</font>

556
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,889
initially that this this list paradigm

557
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,300
or ipv4 is a service overlay paradigm

558
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,970
would basically operate in one direction

559
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,740
namely outbound<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's kind of how</font>

560
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,290
we're thinking about getting this going

561
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,730
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning and so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

562
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,280
imagine in regional networks we'd have a

563
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,780
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITRs pulling traffic in and a</font>

564
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,580
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ETR is basically a tower</font>

566
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,600
like intended to give you a high level

567
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:33,590
of what the actual architecture is going

568
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,120
to look like if there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

569
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">more details on how the routing is going</font>

570
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,840
to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so it's more or less the same</font>

571
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,730
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of paradigm if you look on the left</font>

572
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">hand side there I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got my routes</font>

573
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,450
coming in from my providers coming into

574
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,890
my peering router and then basically by

575
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:48,080
appearing router is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

576
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:49,820
identify which of those prefixes are

577
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,889
really the heavy heavy hitter kind of

578
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,570
prefixes what are the ones that are that

579
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,890
have huge amounts of load to them and

580
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,080
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to allow those to flow down</font>

581
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,320
through our backbone down through our

582
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">metro necks network</font>

583
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,740
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the hub sites</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so those</font>

584
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:03,539
are those of the underlight prefixes

585
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,669
those are the 26,000 prefixes I've

586
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:07,200
talked to you about or 50,000 prefixes

587
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:09,380
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> want but those are the prefixes</font>

588
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,429
that have significant load on them our

589
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,990
peering edge router will basically take

590
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:14,820
all of the routes it's coming into it

591
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:17,610
and then basically send them over to an

592
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,259
ETR these egress tunnel routers and then

593
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,668
these egress tunnel routers will

594
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,649
basically you know send them to a route

595
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:24,389
reflector and dare<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say maybe a</font>

596
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:26,340
controller or something like that that

597
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,870
can apply business logic and again this

598
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,039
is sort of aura<font color="#CCCCCC"> tizen and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> russ was</font>

599
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,080
talking about right we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this</font>

600
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,610
overlay control plane and this business

601
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">logic that sits on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

602
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,080
sort of embodied here though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font>

603
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,309
didn't split it out specifically but you

604
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,720
know we've got something acting at the

605
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:41,428
control plane doing some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route</font>

606
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,990
reflection or whatnot<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe doing</font>

607
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:44,519
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> more sophisticated than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

608
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,620
and then it's sending those routes down

609
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:48,179
to the ITR down into each of the hub

610
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,070
sites or each of the regional networks

611
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:52,529
and then what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I TR is going to do</font>

612
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:54,418
is going to inject a default and so what

613
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:56,070
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine here is that you know</font>

614
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to be allowing those heavy</font>

615
00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,779
hitter prefixes coming down and that's

616
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:01,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">where my knobs are right by the prefixes</font>

617
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:03,659
that I'm allowing to come down in the

618
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,700
underlay that's going to detail or

619
00:21:03,659 --> 00:21:07,919
dictate what gets flows over the

620
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:14,940
underlay or what gets pulled in over the

621
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:17,220
overlay itself ok now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what I'm</font>

622
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,529
proposing here is you know effectively

623
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,889
you know we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to build a v4</font>

624
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:24,809
overlay on top of v6 so logically when

625
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:28,019
you think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want a v4 prefixed</font>

626
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:29,549
with a v6 next<font color="#E5E5E5"> top that doesn't exist</font>

627
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:30,960
today now I know there's an internet

628
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:33,539
draft out there somewhere in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some ways</font>

629
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,820
some form that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically proposing</font>

630
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:38,009
exactly this to basically out allow you

631
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,689
to specify EV for prefixed with the v6

632
00:21:38,009 --> 00:21:42,120
next stop as far as I know there's not

633
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,070
publicly available code to do that now

634
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,418
what so what we wanted to do and you

635
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,529
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to die in to some of</font>

636
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,539
the other thinking that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've shared</font>

637
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:49,980
here NER<font color="#CCCCCC"> noggin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last couple of years is</font>

638
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:52,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we think there really is value</font>

639
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,620
moving control planes for new kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

640
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:59,370
technologies away from classic<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP bits</font>

641
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:01,739
and bytes in tlv<font color="#CCCCCC"> to instead use JSON and</font>

642
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:03,149
so it turns out and I think it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

643
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,190
Google guys not the Google guys here

644
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:06,539
before me but someone from google or set

645
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,669
of folks from google have written

646
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:10,940
something called XO<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

647
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:13,470
so familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's pretty slick</font>

648
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,960
what exit<font color="#E5E5E5"> vgp allows you to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font>

649
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:18,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically speak classic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP to see a</font>

650
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,929
classic BGP component but on the other

651
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:24,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">side it can spit out bgp information in</font>

652
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:26,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">json okay and that's basically what this</font>

653
00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:29,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">is showing us this is basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exit</font>

654
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:31,559
bgp code here in jason is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp update</font>

655
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,418
you will recognize all the information

656
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:36,269
here but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's represented in JSON as</font>

657
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:38,700
opposed to in a classic bgp unity

658
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:41,369
alvey's and the beauty of it being in

659
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:44,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">JSON is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> following the beauty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

660
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:46,139
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to extend this right it's</font>

661
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">very easy for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me to add new attributes</font>

662
00:22:46,139 --> 00:22:50,668
new information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that may not be part of</font>

663
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:52,679
classic be bgp but allows me to

664
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:54,419
experiment or test out new ideas again

665
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:57,090
back to russ's experimental sort of

666
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:59,909
concept and so what we did was<font color="#E5E5E5"> we took</font>

667
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:02,340
the exit vgp output we have an ETR

668
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:04,080
effectively that speaks classic bgp to

669
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:07,738
our peering router and then it spits out

670
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,168
json bgp updates you know to an entity a

671
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:12,749
piece of software we've written and what

672
00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:16,320
that does is basically just add a

673
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:18,419
next-hop value a v6 next top value<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

674
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so we've got JSON of the original</font>

675
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,440
bgp update and v4<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we take that JSON</font>

676
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:24,239
information we add a few more attributes

677
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,340
that indicate things like what the beat

678
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:27,899
what the v6 next top should be and we

679
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically push that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> northbound to a</font>

680
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:32,549
route reflector and today we're doing

681
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:34,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">this via HTTP ok but you know we wanted</font>

682
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:35,999
to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know the fact that it</font>

683
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">is in BGP allows you to extend things</font>

684
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:40,320
much more easily than you know trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

685
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:46,080
you know shoehorn things into a classic

686
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:49,259
bgp itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so this is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

687
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,999
more of a theoretical and again I've had

688
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:52,440
to have had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remove kind of the y-axis</font>

689
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:53,850
details and maybe this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty</font>

690
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">straightforward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but each of those lines</font>

691
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,600
there the red line indicates you know

692
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,519
how much load you would have on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

693
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,649
underlay network you know for different

694
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,999
fib sizes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I believe the</font>

695
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,709
numbers are the red line is<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty</font>

696
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:06,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand five entries so if you underlay</font>

697
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,190
was limited to 20 thousand five entries

698
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:10,289
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically shows you you know how</font>

699
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,720
much load we would have any underlay and

700
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:14,369
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you allow the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FIB sizes to</font>

701
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,679
grow and more traffic to be pulled on

702
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:21,389
the underlay the curves get flat and go

703
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:22,960
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so kind of to wrap it up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

704
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:25,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">so what are we doing</font>

705
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,470
you know we're trying to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you</font>

706
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:28,928
know what this futuristic network

707
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:31,000
architecture would look like again you

708
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:33,190
know as we're slowly transitioning more

709
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,110
traffic from v42 v6 we're thinking about

710
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:36,669
what do we want our network ecosystem

711
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,649
look like in the future and so we're

712
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:40,899
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know building at an</font>

713
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:43,809
ipv4 is a service overlay<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network to</font>

714
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:45,039
kind of you know get us you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

715
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:47,320
more efficient in terms of our

716
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,820
underlying infrastructure and this we

717
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,189
think of this as almost as beginning the

718
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,960
trend the beginning of transitioning

719
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,630
services out of the kind of classic

720
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">underlay networking into the cloud okay</font>

721
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,559
and v4 is one of the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> services that</font>

722
00:24:58,419 --> 00:25:01,270
we're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that and</font>

723
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:03,428
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> value here again because it</font>

724
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:05,529
gives us it empowers us as service

725
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:06,940
providers to kind of do the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

726
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:08,350
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do without having to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

727
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,080
the vendors and ask them to build

728
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,059
features for us so we find you know a

729
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,029
lot of value in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of doing that and</font>

730
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:17,770
you know you the kind of classic Sdn

731
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:19,960
paradigm do we program the network or do

732
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:21,940
we make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it lean you know today I think</font>

733
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">at least from my perspective you know</font>

734
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">really make sense to make the underlay</font>

735
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Network lean fewer features a fewer fib</font>

736
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:30,340
entries and move complexity into the

737
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,039
cloud<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we have more ability to kind</font>

738
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,110
of manage it and I just want observation

739
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,549
here again you know you know with Sdn

740
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,020
you have the network and cloud kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

741
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:39,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">combining one of the learnings that we</font>

742
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,139
had here you know is that you know

743
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,210
OpenStack you know evolved out of data

744
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,470
center space and so they're still

745
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,240
playing a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of catch-up in the</font>

746
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,520
networking space so one of the things we

747
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,010
realized was kind of OpenStack wasn't

748
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,049
quite ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of do all to support</font>

749
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:55,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the features that we needed to</font>

750
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:58,120
do this ipv4 is an overlay now kilo just

751
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,830
came out in April and it sounds like

752
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,029
kilo might have the features but we

753
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,379
haven't got a chance to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really look at</font>

754
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:03,880
it but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's still some</font>

755
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,559
catch-up that the OpenStack folks are

756
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,940
doing to kind of get us to this point to

757
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:08,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">get us to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point where you really do</font>

758
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:11,860
network services on top of cloud

759
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:14,469
infrastructure and then just one other

760
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:17,139
slide here this is I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> the third</font>

761
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:18,909
time have been to nanog you in June to

762
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,350
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of present and I just wanted to</font>

763
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:22,570
kind of connect the dots because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

764
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:25,270
these things do really connect together

765
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,250
and again two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know is here</font>

766
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:29,649
up up on the stage here proposing and it

767
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,539
makes sense or<font color="#CCCCCC"> we believe it makes sense</font>

768
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:33,949
to start transitioning control planes to

769
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:36,710
kind of be more JSON and

770
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,419
people rented and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know again it</font>

771
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,159
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> other service providers are</font>

772
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:42,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">going down that same path Google went</font>

773
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,970
out and built you know XO bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

774
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:45,799
know if it was specifically to support

775
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">json or just as amazing doing</font>

776
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:49,820
troubleshooting but there seems to be a

777
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:51,559
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more energy behind kind of</font>

778
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,269
reevaluating how we do control planes

779
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:55,668
and maybe this touches again back on

780
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:56,840
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> russ was talking about so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we think</font>

781
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:58,159
there is you know control plane

782
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,570
evolution clearly control plane

783
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,639
evolution that we're leveraging today

784
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,870
you know last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year we were proposing or</font>

785
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:05,178
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what we were calling this</font>

786
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:07,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">hybrid router platform architecture the</font>

787
00:27:05,179 --> 00:27:09,409
ability within a component router to

788
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,899
basically add your own operator specific

789
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:14,120
code and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we you know we propose</font>

790
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:15,739
that we demonstrated last year writing

791
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">segment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or building our own version</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

792
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,799
segment routing and running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box</font>

793
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,600
and actually you know dropping<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our</font>

794
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,820
own version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Isis as well so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

795
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:25,010
kind of like legacy or platform

796
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,629
evolution within the box and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

797
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,250
what we're suggesting today we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think is</font>

798
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,880
really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end-to-end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

799
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,990
of evolution<font color="#E5E5E5"> where now we're basically</font>

800
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,610
refining assets of services<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

801
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:37,070
happening within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network ecosystem</font>

802
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:39,350
and then lifting the the ones we really

803
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:43,580
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more agility to and putting</font>

804
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:45,408
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the cloud okay all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so</font>

805
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,559
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my talk thank you much for your</font>

806
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:47,559
time

807
00:27:54,450 --> 00:28:01,420
what hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brian Allen to run from I can I</font>

808
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:03,790
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a comment in a</font>

809
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:07,000
question than for you comment is about a

810
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:14,050
very futuristic technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was made</font>

811
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:16,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">in 2009 it's a in RFC 5512 and 55 65 the</font>

812
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:20,530
talks about you can have an athena safi

813
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:23,830
in BGP<font color="#E5E5E5"> 34 others families so I 12 and</font>

814
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:26,830
done because some friends from<font color="#CCCCCC"> zernich</font>

815
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:29,580
in China had an ipv6 only backbone they

816
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:32,919
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to about bgp forever ipv4</font>

817
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,780
universities so the first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> described</font>

818
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,780
the office a second one described a

819
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:40,090
framework and now this is all done our

820
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,100
is implemented to virus vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

821
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:44,709
quite sure about different vendors have

822
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:47,080
done different routes that the actual

823
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:49,240
technology exists it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

824
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,490
implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> where at least in China kept</font>

825
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:55,110
very think so well the second is a

826
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:58,929
question is about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of prefixes</font>

827
00:28:55,110 --> 00:29:01,959
how many prefixes do you foresee in an

828
00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:03,429
ipv6 mostly world I've out different

829
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,929
comments people saying is going to be

830
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:06,309
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> small people think is going to be</font>

831
00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:07,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the same as default there's no</font>

832
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:09,700
difference what's your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ticket</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think</font>

833
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:11,110
the thinking is that we think it's it's

834
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,570
not going to be nearly as bad as before

835
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:15,639
today and maybe not as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would</font>

836
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,678
like it to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like in cherry pie</font>

837
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,570
v6 space so I think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

838
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,340
somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in between but the thinking</font>

839
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:22,928
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you know that we're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

840
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,730
hopefully not going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

841
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:26,080
much kind of we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have</font>

842
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,700
been going down the same evolutionary

843
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,559
path that we went with before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

844
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,929
side or pre side or all those sorts of

845
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:35,440
issues so hopefully we'll have built you

846
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:39,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">know an addressing plan that is much</font>

847
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,280

those technologies because I'm the

00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:53,389
the same thing on you know certain GRE

891

again it in an i don't know if you know

with rust again what he was saying you

893
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,720
know with the centralized controller and

894
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,460
what not and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suggesting we go</font>

895
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:09,470
down that path but I think there's a

896
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:11,420
desire from service providers you know

897
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,800
to kind of you know have more ability to

898
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,690
manage and what's happening in the

899
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,550
network and in the process can we

900
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,530
eliminate what's happening there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

901
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:20,450
the parallel the paradigm when I was

902
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:22,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about this it's as if you know</font>

903
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,410
even with the hierarchical stuff it's

904
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,300
like you know we're asking the vendors

905
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,190
to build like a concrete highway to

906
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,270
every taco bell 7 11 and Pizza Hut

907
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,770
that's going to be made in the entire

908
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,300
world and for the most part we're not

909
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:34,760
using most of those lanes because you go

910
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:36,740
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pizza</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hut nearby right so we can</font>

911
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,200
maybe solve this via other mechanisms

912
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,790
but again I question you know is that

913
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,080
the right paradigm or do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have do we</font>

914
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about solving it differently but</font>

915
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,720
I'm not saying not to investigate that

916
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:49,430
path<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay right point taken thank you</font>

917
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,080
Jeff Houston a painting look I was kind

918
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:53,750
of curious about your comment about fear

919
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:56,060
and I'm kind of wondering if it's the

920
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:58,100
size or the speed that is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

921
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:02,000
issue with fear and the cross point is

922
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:04,939
to cost them right well<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs number of</font>

923
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,260
gates you know that sighs very<font color="#E5E5E5"> speed is</font>

924
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,240
something that's really hard to buy

925
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,100
right because at some point you just

926
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,550
can't go any<font color="#CCCCCC"> faster right and</font>

927
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:16,189
realistically is speed the problem here

928
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:19,490
as distinct from size so i think it's

929
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:22,570
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two the two combined together and in</font>

930
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:26,210

<font color="#E5E5E5">128-bit wide fit entries which is four</font>

932
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,960
times the size so hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've gotten</font>

many mirror fewer you know entries in

both from a content provider and from

regard calm casting eyeballs provider we

960
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:53,929
have very similar results so I was

961
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:56,570
tending to think that the very low

well perhaps on provider networks but in

large customer networks that might

986
