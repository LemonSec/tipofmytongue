nice wireless network but it's wide open

last time so we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it again</font>

66
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,320
I'll do some minor changes

67
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,630
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lightning talk is a 10 minute talk on</font>

69
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:02,040
odd so we're soliciting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on site topics</font>

70
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,500
and abstracts soon as I sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down again</font>

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,970
we have until twelve-thirty tomorrow

76
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,440
tomorrow afternoon the program committee

77
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,738
will decide which ones we want to hear

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,169
about and then on Wednesday morning

81
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,190
were some really new stuff some

82
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,850
while ideas some research that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

83
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,850
brand new

84
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,010
that's gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> be my craft</font>

85
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,540
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for me now I'm going to</font>

86
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,539
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> you over to our host webbing</font>

officially welcome to

89
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:51,219
37

90
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,200
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really was the nano that almost</font>

91
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:57,620
wasn't and

92
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,890
at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saw decided would be</font>

93
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:03,230
okay to grab some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sound-effects up to</font>

94
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,599
know what it was like at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

95
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,840
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> night yes they often about two</font>

96
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,840
o'clock

97
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,919
this was a significant effort I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

98
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank all the folks from Merritt and a</font>

99
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:20,878
whole group of other people i will name

100
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,830
shortly that actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> made this occur</font>

101
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,900
this was an uphill battle not only

102
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,909
because of the time that believe it or

103
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,349
not because of the location one of the

104
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:31,800
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about as the</font>

105
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:33,419
host is to try and encourage other

106
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,550
people to host and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to tell you</font>

107
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the differences are between the way</font>

108
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,219
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have done it the last four times</font>

109
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:45,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not expensive</font>

110
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:50,400
it's not difficult all you need is time

111
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:53,069
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> even idea here are the benefits of</font>

112
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,299
hosting just so that you know them the

113
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:57,599
first thing of course is that you get to

114
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,469
choose the location sort of the last two

115
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have been able to choose it's been</font>

116
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:04,998
none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them have been my home locations</font>

117
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's much easier if you do this at home</font>

118
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:10,349
so if you run short a time you're going

119
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:15,120
to end up having to travel to other

120
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:17,250
places but you can choose them t-shirts

121
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,229
a real big benefit is you get to

122
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:22,589
actually be involved in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> design of</font>

123
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:24,068
t-shirts and the awesome I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font>

124
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:28,210
how to make this bigger

125
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:28,210
can you guys actually see the sore

126
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,909
move closer forward Mats

127
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,550
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to worry too much now</font>

128
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:48,430
but at least we'll know for the future

129
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:51,040
I'll try this kind of thing anyway

130
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:57,130
t-shirts you get to design t-shirts and

131
00:08:51,040 --> 00:09:00,130
you sometimes get to influence the theme

132
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:02,589
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the t-shirts so these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are some of</font>

133
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:05,189
those that I've had in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past you guys</font>

134
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:09,150
probably will remember some of these

135
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,150
yeah what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

136
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:28,250
so just to go over some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rough</font>

137
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:30,950
bits over here the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest issue we had</font>

138
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,530
with this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually the hotel it</font>

139
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,610
was connectivity and my little

140
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,280
presentation I'm going to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

141
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:41,240
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the connectivity issues if</font>

142
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:43,970
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to host the first thing you</font>

143
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:48,800
want to do off you identify all of the

144
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:50,870
hotels<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can actually handle the</font>

145
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,810
conference of 500 people without Turner

146
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:58,220
rooms only go to hotels that have

147
00:09:53,810 --> 00:10:01,729
existing fiber if they don't have fiber

148
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:05,450
from a carrier that you know through

149
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:08,240
nanog don't bother that's the battle

150
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,580
that's almost impossible to win and also

151
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,920
ends up costing you a fortune so you

152
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,320
want to try and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font>

153
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,400
fiber the second thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to do is</font>

154
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they aren't</font>

155
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,699
any

156
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:28,220
access fees or news feeds that have

157
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,720
nothing to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the equipment have</font>

158
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,730
nothing to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the costs of actually</font>

159
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,199
bringing anything in even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

160
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,420
is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't</font>

161
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:37,130
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that problem one of the first</font>

162
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">things you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask because if you</font>

163
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,100
don't down the road you're going to

164
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:45,670
discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is some interesting</font>

165
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,670
charges that can be levied how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

166
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:59,229
that's not nice

167
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:05,589
I can switch I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> switch to you know</font>

168
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,589
windows if you want

169
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,138
okay well we got have to live with us

170
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,800
so let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the benefits again</font>

171
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,110
sub size of t-shirts

172
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,930
you get wonderful engineering

173
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,339
opportunities you get to do things that

174
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">you probably never thought you'd ever</font>

175
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:49,170
have to do so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some interesting</font>

176
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:50,610
places that we have to go to get

177
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,339
connectivity this is what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like</font>

178
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:56,730
this time except that it wasn't snow and

179
00:11:53,339 --> 00:12:01,200
ice but you'll get your season picture

180
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,820
shortly<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it took the Nano</font>

181
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,990
community is a really important part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

182
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,209
it you get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity to actually</font>

183
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,160
give something back to the community

184
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:11,489
which for me has been really important

185
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,719
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i posted now through three</font>

186
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">of my companies three different</font>

187
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,560
companies over time

188
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,089
oh ok

189
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:24,040
it's working<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

190
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:25,990
you also get exposure this is really

191
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:30,579
important as a host it was touched on

192
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:33,220
yesterday by I think Randy and by Steve

193
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:35,229
you do get one benefit from a corporate

194
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,149
point of view that is very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

195
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,819
do get exposure for your company so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

196
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:42,309
do have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to actually generate</font>

197
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:44,410
a favorite of goodwill for the company

198
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:46,420
don't underestimate that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you go to</font>

199
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:49,540
your company you ask for help and it's

200
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay to you know it in the right way and</font>

201
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,430
there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules to actually</font>

202
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,410
introduce that bit of the marketing

203
00:12:54,430 --> 00:13:00,790
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the marketing of marketing</font>

204
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,779
event but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a benefit for hosting so</font>

205
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,949
the thing that you guys obviously

206
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:09,129
interested in is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

207
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:12,219
architecture so there's a plan a physic

208
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:15,850
was existing SBC an AT&T OC 12 at the

209
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,499
DMark in this facility<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay should be</font>

210
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,829
able to get connectivity<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a real cheap</font>

211
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:27,009
we know some people SBC<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ATT just</font>

212
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:29,258
like typical nanos nope so there's

213
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:32,199
licensee that says this is a mandatory

214
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:38,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten thousand dollar use feed for the</font>

215
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:41,709
existing AT&T equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well</font>

216
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,709
let's go to plan B

217
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:49,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">Obama it has a gig ether fiber into the</font>

218
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,079
building put in by one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other</font>

219
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,020
nanog attendees I found out yesterday

220
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:57,070
for a conference earlier this year back

221
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">then youtube I think</font>

222
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,750
so dig into this big eater maybe we can

223
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:06,258
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not the spc it</font>

224
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,259
since Ethan

225
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,070
nope

226
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:13,050
nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> fried is still meant for a</font>

227
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,340
ten-thousand-dollar use fee<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though</font>

228
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:20,300
the equipment is in place in the

229
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:24,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">neighborhood</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well how about this</font>

230
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:26,040
the Hilton has a fiber run to the

231
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,810
infrastructure it's part of the fiber

232
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:35,180
infrastructure well to coat Michael

233
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:35,180
Jordan if you guys remember the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ad</font>

234
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,420
off the expressway over the rover off

235
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,120
the Billboard through the window off the

236
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:47,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">wall nothing but net so we'll try to do</font>

237
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:49,650
this another way we'll use microwave to

238
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,870
connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hilton to Mae West 55 south</font>

even a<font color="#CCCCCC"> video editing a cialis time and</font>

243
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:05,450
away so we'll go to Plan C

actually done the engineering had

260
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,809
everything and had<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff on the roof</font>

was all working and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

264
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,499
radios were broken so we fiddled with

00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:08,449
the radios and still no signal and then

266
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:10,339
we discovered looking on the windows in

267
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:13,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">that building there's a little serial</font>

ended up it actually all worked and

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you guys are using today</font>
