00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,060
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a real quick talk very simple</font>

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,030
topic the question was asked of me years

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,980
ago what what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it do delay all about</font>

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,750
what is it simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a constant we</font>

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,700
can measure it does it have interesting

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,520
dynamics question turns out to be

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,820
somewhat yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhat no so I set out to</font>

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,300
figure out exactly what is inside of

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,369
this otherwise boring time series so

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,439
what we doing here what were you in here

11
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,939
we're picking things fast like 10

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,070
millisecond probes for millisecond

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,260

you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> read exactly how we did it I'm</font>

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,420
the christening resolver visual so what

18
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,440
we'll be testing here what will be

19
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,809
pinging quickly in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case some 75</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily harmonically related</font>

again<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows has a similar behavior</font>

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,190

<font color="#E5E5E5">today but we can at least ask a couple</font>

147
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,950
interesting questions that I guess play

148
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,680
more to a research of a research been to

149

this or a more a more academic<font color="#CCCCCC"> bend and</font>

150
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,750
that is when doing this work the

151
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,720
question came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up is networked I'm a</font>

152
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,180
thing that is continuous time ie is it a

153
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,070
real signal that when we sample it we

154
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">should see differences in terms of alias</font>

155
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:30,560
alias output for example if you sample

156
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,570
an analog signal at below its natural

157
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,729
components of frequency rather below the

158
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nyquist of that signal requirements you</font>

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,880
alias version of the original signal we

162
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,979
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see those effects in sampling</font>

163
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,719
delay the more we sample the more is

164
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:50,510
revealed we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see what was revealed</font>

165
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,880
change throughout sampling rates which

166
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,099
would mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it did change that</font>

167
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,050
the signal is continuous time but at the

<font color="#E5E5E5">same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time a networks done in Pierre</font>

169
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,340

170
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,099
correct answer no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> really has thought</font>

171
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:06,010
about this too<font color="#E5E5E5"> much from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what I can tell</font>

175
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:14,570
those components another one I haven't

176
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">really thought about but certainly could</font>

177
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,950
be worth<font color="#CCCCCC"> checking out and then again</font>

178
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,740
this is a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a strange data set</font>

179
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:24,500
when we sample things we only have

180
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:27,620
positive values there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> waveform for</font>

181
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:30,710
saying there's no sinusoid to this this

182
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,620
is all a random positive going value

183
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,900
that does not cross zero so when we

184
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,880
produce for you outputs or way when

185
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,460
outputs we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a strong zero hurt</font>

186
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,690
component there's a DC offset how does

187
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,880
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be pulled with there's</font>

188
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:45,770
some ways I've done this but does it

<font color="#E5E5E5">change the validity the data no that's</font>

190

happen X board can this piece for

191
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:53,270
fingerprinting national questions i

192
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,880
think yes perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this could be the</font>

some sort if someone were enterprising

195
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,380
and could incorporate all the necessary

196
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:08,590
tools and gathering work that

197
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:11,710
fingerprints that's all any questions

198
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,710
thank you
