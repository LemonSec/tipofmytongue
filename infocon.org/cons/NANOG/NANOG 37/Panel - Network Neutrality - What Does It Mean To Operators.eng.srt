has been at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the forefront of both the</font>

august 2005 there was an FCC policy

statement which basically reiterated

what Powell had said before but<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

subject to reasonable network management

41
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:30,060
which is the big caveat at the end that

gives the telco guys the out and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the argument moving again now we're into</font>

49
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:57,270
2006 in March there was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

51
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,130
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a finding that only two percent</font>

52
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:05,008
of Americans have market choice of

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:08,820
broadband providers and that that was an

00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:12,449
effective monopoly or oligopoly and that

55
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,219
therefore regulation was needed so that

56
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:16,199
was the Senate bill<font color="#E5E5E5"> that got referred</font>

60
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,580
of that were that is we shall not

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,760
it goes on to say though that they may

with recent history but network

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:16,000
neutrality has had multiple names over

103
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,669
the years and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current incarnation</font>

2003 same person representative Connors

was also talking about network

00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:41,620
neutrality this was back in a few

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:47,590
mergers ago depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on which merger</font>

111
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:48,790
we're talking about at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that time they</font>

112
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,380
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> also talking about katelyn</font>

113
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,150
neutrality but rather than the telephone

114
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,820
companies at that time it was the cable

115
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:59,020
companies and if you go back even

116
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:03,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">further in history we've had various</font>

battles about all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font>

118
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:09,730
what's interesting is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times the</font>

119
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:13,560
government has stepped in through

120
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:18,120
various agencies and when they step in

121
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:20,920
they sometimes make<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting choices</font>

122
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,670
for the old<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray beards around here</font>

123
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,880
remember the ANS days with core plus re

124
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:29,469
and that was so fully approved fully

125
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,590
backed by the National Science

126

commercialization and privatization to

128
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:41,620
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network but we also had the battles</font>

129
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:45,280
with kicks at that time kicks was the

130
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:48,100
good guys and ANS was evil guys but then

131
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,410
kicks turned into the evil guy because

132
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,450
they were going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start filtering</font>

133
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,790
resellers and at that time sprint was

134
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:57,640
the good guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> I believe because sprint</font>

135
00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:00,329
was opposing kicks but don't worry

136
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:04,480
sprint then turned into the evil guy and

137
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:06,580
we keep on going so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> National Science</font>

138
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,340

140
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,980

141
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,910
there like all network service providers

142
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,280
had to connect to

143
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:20,439
all the network at all the primary

144
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,079
network access points is I priority

145
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,730
network access points but it also had

146
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:28,480
other clauses like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you also had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

support gossip and OSI and and all those

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,800
other good things in reality all that

149
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,480
did is just create a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

150
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,189
opportunities for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of service</font>

151
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,840
providers out there because no one could

152
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,270
be sure what was going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

153
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">network so you better get a couple of</font>

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,530
network service providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing</font>

155
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,300
came real big because you never knew

156
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,939
when appearing battle might break out

157
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,250
between someone we have hearing battles

158
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:58,180
back then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I left it off but there was</font>

159
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,830
the great pizza hut calm debate if folks

160
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,660
remember it turns out you cannot reach

163
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:10,020
the acceptable use policy at the time

00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:10,020
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could reach it from you you net</font>

165
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:19,390
so here's the policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> wonks slide in the</font>

they're not actually a state we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

171
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:39,670
hold it against them in chicago<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

172
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,830
the communications after 1934 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried</font>

173
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:45,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to divide up things based upon</font>

174
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:48,310
technology in 1934 so you kind of had

175
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:51,280
common carriers broadcast radio at the

176
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,560
time and TV came later and then you had

177
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,569
the general FCC<font color="#CCCCCC"> authority which is kind</font>

178
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like this catch-all if we can't</font>

179
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:02,080
figure out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is the FCC still has</font>

180
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:04,750
has authority over it so at the

181
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,190
beginning there was a much there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

182
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,450
some stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the catch-all but pretty</font>

183
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,600
much everything was either common

184
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:14,140
carrier<font color="#E5E5E5"> or radio but then you got weird</font>

185
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,750
stuff like cable TV came in and time

186
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,510
sharing and remote data processing and

187
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:23,410
those all were also under the the

188
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:25,569
general authority 1984 they carved out

189
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,890
cable TV and put it off into its own

190
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,150
little silo over

191
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:32,090
so now you had this weird thing where

192
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:34,069
you had common carrier but cable TV was

193
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a common carrier but then what</font>

194
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:40,370
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> when cable starts doing voice</font>

195
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:44,180
and and cable data and things like that

196
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:47,690
is is that under<font color="#CCCCCC"> title</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 or title 2 or</font>

197
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:51,500
things got really weird so recently the

198
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:55,130
FCC moved dsl and cable modems out of

199
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,600
title<font color="#E5E5E5"> to entitle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 back into title</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

200
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,570
is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the general catch-all</font>

201
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,360
category and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have up their VoIP</font>

202
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:05,480
and I could put IPTV and whatever random

203
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,640
things we come up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future which</font>

204
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:12,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">silo do all those things go into if</font>

205
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,580
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do regulation the</font>

206
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,340
reason why that's important because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

207
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:21,040
kind of sets<font color="#E5E5E5"> the framework for how the</font>

208
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,040
government deals with with technology

209
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:28,070
the other big thing was it's all calm

210
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:30,680
after 1996 before 1996 we have something

211
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,480
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> enhanced services if you remember</font>

212
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">these were things like time net tell</font>

213
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,820
neck top you serve remote time sharing

214
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,040
and so forth in the theory of behind the

215
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:43,600
enhanced services was there was only a

216
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:46,130
single supplier of transmission capacity

217
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,550
in any part of the country usually that

218
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:51,230
was eighteen t sometimes it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> gte</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

219
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,640
few thousand other little small

220
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,420
telephone companies you have ever heard

221
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:59,449
of and the concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> was says that you had</font>

222
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,599
this one one company entering into what

223
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:05,030
was viewed<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a competitive marketplace</font>

224
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:09,250
in reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was more or less the IBM</font>

225
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:16,699
versus 18t battle of the 1950s after

226
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:18,740
1996 the information services were

227
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,330
defined in the telecom act but the

228
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,460
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about information</font>

229
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,620
services is they run over

230
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,600
telecommunications not a common carrier

231
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,990
and anyone can provide

232
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,880
telecommunications your wife eyes

233
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:34,010
telecommunications if you're on run

234
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,080
fiber yourselves as telecommunications

235
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,540
and you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a common</font>

236
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,740
carrier in order to do

237
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,670
telecommunications and that's why I

238
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">cable company</font>

239
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can now offer telecommunications</font>

240
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:48,350
even though<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> considered</font>

241
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:50,750
common carriers and likewise radio and

242
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:54,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">television stations can also broadcast</font>

243
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:56,660
IP packets in their sub carriers as

244
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:00,140
telecommunications without becoming

245
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:03,170
common carriers so now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this</font>

246
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:05,240
interesting thing of we have multiple

247
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:09,589
suppliers and information services and

248
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:12,640
they aren't really you can't replace one

249
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:14,870
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other they aren't all the same</font>

250
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">yahoo and google are distinct</font>

251
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,470
information services and and just

252
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,780
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean you</font>

253
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:24,740
don't want the other and you also have

254
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:29,089
some suppliers of network access but not

255
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:31,070
as many generally two or so but now you

256
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:34,060
have the potential for<font color="#CCCCCC"> new entrants from</font>

257
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:38,530
any direction in in both those areas and

258
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:41,180
in fact in 2006 the majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of home</font>

259
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:44,660
broadband access does not come over

260
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:48,500
common carriers as defined by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 1934</font>

261
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:51,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">act they actually come over cable</font>

262
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,560
companies basically just having multiple

263
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,180
resellers of the same product wasn't

264
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">this wasn't good enough to attract</font>

265
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:03,020
customers customers are basically fickle

266
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:05,810
so regardless of whether you think

267
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,660
network neutrality is good evil what you

268
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:11,089
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are going to do most</font>

269
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">network providers have found as we saw</font>

270
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,230
going all the way back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the ANS days</font>

271
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,680
so the compu serve days or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the AO all</font>

272
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:20,360
days that that interfering with what the

273
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,089
customers want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is a bad business</font>

274
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:27,020
practice because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't predict what</font>

275
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:28,600
the next killer apps going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be and the</font>

276
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,270
nice thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the Internet is is</font>

277
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,830
everyone can complain about everything

278
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:37,640
who would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have heard about Madison River</font>

279
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:39,560
a few years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> The Associated Press</font>

280
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:43,550
might have written<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little article but</font>

281
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,589
now everyone knows the name so the

282
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:47,510
reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> is as access providers need as</font>

283
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,190
many information services as possible

284
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:52,160
and information services needs as many

285
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:53,740
access providers it's possible but the

286
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,380
hard thing about putting this in

287
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,830
do kind of a cute phrase like network

288
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:01,450
neutrality is is we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no idea</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what those deals are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be in</font>

290
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:09,970
advance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if if we had set the</font>

291
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:13,650
network rules based on 1992 we would

292
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:16,870
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a and s core re</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as the defined</font>

293
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:21,100
official government grant of networking

294
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:23,319
in the US but instead we refrain from

295
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:25,780
that and we watched the peering battles

296
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:29,860
go through and all kinds of other really

297
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:32,440
bad stuff happen and and we worked our

298
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,389
way through it and the hard thing about

299
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,980
working our way through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is we really</font>

and information services there's not a

with a lot of the spam and antivirus and

the Daedelus and all the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

that that solely customers have had had

asked are now viewed as<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been viewed as networking</font>

00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:36,310
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

320
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:38,710
you you have 11 line one sentence in a

00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,780
statute and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually turns into a</font>

couple hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> pages in the Code of</font>

want state federal local are all

327
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:58,810
overworked underfunded so who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

328
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,460
try and enforce these regulations if you

329
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,590
say anyone can enforce them then

330
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,470
basically everyone including competitors

331
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:07,270
will just start filing complaints about

332
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,610
any any perceived

333
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,590
thing or just simply on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the principle of</font>

334
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,419
if you file a complaint then your

00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,459
competitor can't do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:19,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another few years to do whatever</font>

337
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:21,760
you're doing so we've seen this with the

338
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:25,780
telecom attacks and the Communications

339
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,180
Act basically the the court<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the</font>

340
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:31,870
court dockets and the agency<font color="#E5E5E5"> dockets are</font>

341
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:35,320
filled with complaints counter

342
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:38,290
complaints and vice versa going back and

343
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,649
forth and for regulators technologies

344
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:43,480
just too hard and I mean when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font>

345
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,910
down to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at how they solve</font>

346
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,560
problems generally they end up just

347
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,240
saying okay we can't figure out what

348
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,179
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do or how you're doing</font>

349
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,890
it but we do understand dollars so we're

350
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:56,380
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go ahead</font>

351
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,880
and do it but you only can charge five

352
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,430
dollars to do it or you can only charge

353
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,990
ten dollars to do it or whatever so in

354
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:05,860
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end the regulation never actually</font>

355
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:08,740
prevents any company from doing whatever

356
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:11,350
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government the steps in and</font>

357
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,800
sets the price so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

358
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,659
prevent evil the government will say

359
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,180
well you can be evil it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just cost you</font>

360
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:21,370
a few dollars and we've seen this before

361
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:24,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the broadcast fairness doctrine in the</font>

362
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:26,260
US this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the equal time provision in</font>

363
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,270
the end the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network's justice at the</font>

364
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:31,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">national networks have just decided they</font>

365
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:35,620
won't sell in anyone this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very equal</font>

366
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:39,159
no one gets just by advocacy ads on

367
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:42,010
national networks except politicians who

368
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,420
get the lowest ad rates again government

369
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,310
can set dollars but they can't figure

370
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,840
out much else and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> kingsbury</font>

371
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,340
commitment this is the thing the

372
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">kingsbury commitment is actually what</font>

373
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,919
created the AT&T monopoly it sounded

374
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:56,169
great 18t will interconnect with all the

375
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,420
telephone companies in the US but in the

376
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:00,370
end what it really did is it eliminated

377
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:03,490
any need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have any competitive long</font>

378
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:05,139
distance because ATT had to connect with

379
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,730
everyone so why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need a second</font>

380
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:13,060
long distance company and that let AT&T

381
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:15,430
set rates for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60 years and finally</font>

382
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:18,310
we've seen the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with universal</font>

383
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:20,340
service that it sounds great we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

384
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,928
to give telephones to everyone but in

385
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,908
what it turned it out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be as the</font>

386
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:27,539
regulator's viewed the goal of giving

00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:29,220
telephones to everyone as as protecting

388
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:32,039
the people who were giving the

389
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:36,600
telephones to everyone so we'll go on to

<font color="#E5E5E5">the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one so Sean's given us a bit of</font>

the arguments in<font color="#E5E5E5"> favor of net neutrality</font>

a few of the ones in favor preference

<font color="#CCCCCC">will go to dominant players rather than</font>

398
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:06,658
technological innovators if you allow

399
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:08,549
ISPs and phone companies to block new

400
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,919
technologies on their their network

401
00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:13,820
right the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are innovating</font>

00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:17,419
don't have money yet to make playoffs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

403
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:19,889
carriers the people who are sitting on

404
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:23,610
already developed technology do have

405
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:25,200
that money it locks things in place as

406
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,580
long as consumers can't vote with their

407
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,409
feet in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a free market of competing</font>

00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:32,580
predatory practices right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

410
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:35,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">argument that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have monopoly</font>

411
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:37,350
people can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick up and leave and</font>

412
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,549
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else so you have to keep</font>

413
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:42,000
the monopoly from doing things

414
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:43,529
anticompetitive or keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> them from doing</font>

415
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,710
things that would hurt the consumer

416
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:48,539
rather non-discrimination is part and

417
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:51,750
parcel of common carrier status is

418
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:53,580
another argument that if you want the

419
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:56,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">benefits of common carrier you have to</font>

420
00:22:53,580 --> 00:23:01,110
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> round in and let everything go by</font>

421
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:02,520
without looking at it and lastly a lot

422
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:05,908
of the access networks were built under

423
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:09,029
monopoly protection and you know had

424
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:12,059
guaranteed rates being paid to them by

425
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:14,460
consumers and therefore they're kind of

426
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:17,129
a moral property of the consumers rather

427
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,330
than the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were operating them</font>

428
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:22,039
at the time that they were getting

429
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:24,600
guaranteed payments so on the flip side

430
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:27,210
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are arguments against</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> net</font>

protect customers from bad traffic and

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,779
customers define some things as bad and

434
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:36,570
will pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> more to</font>

instance service bundling is necessary

438
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,679
to encourage future investment

infrastructure if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody to</font>

00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:50,519
build out more infrastructure in the

00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:51,928
future you have to let<font color="#E5E5E5"> them make deals</font>

442
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:54,899
and make money with what they've got

443
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:56,639
right now government doesn't understand

444
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:58,559
the business the internet and any

445
00:23:56,639 --> 00:24:00,658
regulatory action will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have unintended</font>

446
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:03,570
consequences which will be worse than

447
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:05,129
whatever was intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> because government</font>

448
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:08,999
doesn't know this stuff and will screw

449
00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:10,978
up if it tries to meddle lastly

450
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:13,200
non-discrimination is compelled speech

451
00:24:10,979 --> 00:24:16,979
in the First Amendment sense you can't

452
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,489
force someone to pay for someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else to</font>

453
00:24:16,979 --> 00:24:22,529
say something that they disagree with

454
00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:24,629
First Amendment protection so let's get

455
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:26,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">on to questions for the panel I've got a</font>

456
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:28,619
few to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started and then if we</font>

457
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:31,349
have time and you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose to ask</font>

458
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:33,769
questions rather than going to lunch we

459
00:24:31,349 --> 00:24:35,879
can continue as long as you feel like

460
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:40,169
first let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> start with the free speech</font>

461
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:42,449
issues can carriers claim common carrier

462
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:44,759
protection from responsibility for

463
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:47,399
customer content but also simultaneously

464
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:48,960
claim a seemingly contradictory First

465
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:52,168
Amendment protection from compelled

466
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,139
speech so that's question to you

467
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:57,809
panelists do you want me to clarify it

468
00:24:55,139 --> 00:25:00,178
read it again the guys up here obviously

469
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:05,969
can't see any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it any of this stuff</font>

different even though fundamentally

there are similar issues issues of

basically the whole network neutrality

486
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:48,870
debate which I can I think summarized as

487
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,850
does the incumbent have the right to

488
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:52,590
deliberately degrade services being

489
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,629
offered to its customers in such a way

490
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:56,730
that it targets non-customers of sales

495

610
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:35,170
given the large amount of video traffic

also handily anticipates an upcoming

00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:50,800
question but first let me drop one on

617
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:54,570
brokaw so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take a hypothetical</font>

618
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:57,419
situation oh I'll pretend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be say a</font>

619
00:30:54,570 --> 00:31:01,710
incumbent carrier in the southeast and

620
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:04,750
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say well so I've got this</font>

621
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:07,180
unfortunate net neutrality act that's

622
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:09,820
blocking what I want to do which is to

623
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:11,440
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> say ha pay me some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money even</font>

624
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,810

625
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:18,130
want to reach my customers so instead

626
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:23,320
I'm going to say well since I can't be

627
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:24,820
compelled<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay for speech that I don't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">agree with and I don't really agree with</font>

your advertisers I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:40,659
that I've sold or at least I'll threaten

633
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:43,780
to do so and ask you whether you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

634
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:46,360
do some revenue sharing of your

advertisers may be mandatory revenue

636
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:53,260
sharing else I'll do add replacement so

637
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:54,670
where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go with that well I think</font>

638
00:31:53,260 --> 00:32:00,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's fair to say that that's not a good</font>

thing not for you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know that that</font>

640
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:04,150
gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> into this discussion about how</font>

641
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,620
intrusive and incumbent can be in kind

642
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:08,530
of controlling the the content that

643
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:12,159
makes up you know what Yahoo is or what

644
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:14,860
Google is or what Microsoft is<font color="#CCCCCC"> etc and I</font>

645
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's a that's a possibility but</font>

646
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,959
I think it's fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that that's an</font>

647
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,610
unlikely scenario to rear its ugly head

648
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,559
you know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing in an</font>

649
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:28,389
with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue that is mainly and then</font>

650
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:30,129
focuses around or deals around an

push I push traffic out to my user I

653
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:40,510
don't I'm sorry I'm offering up my my

654
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:42,429
content to my user base I'm not pushing

655
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:45,700
it up so it's being pulled by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user</font>

656
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:47,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I don't see in an environment down</font>

657
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:50,500
the road where the incumbent or any

658
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:53,590
other network is able to pick out<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ad</font>

659
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,299
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> place another ad in there if that</font>

660
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:57,129
were to happen then I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

the revenues that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we generate from from</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">an incumbent or a cable provider etc</font>

apart what we are and that's likely to

00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,459
happen who knows that gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this</font>

673
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,049
discussion about a walled garden and

some networks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the audience here that</font>

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,520
have moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from a walled garden and</font>

678
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,770
and there's some discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,929
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not this type of environment</font>

680
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:46,510
will create more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a walled garden</font>

681
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:48,400
environment the net will not be tomorrow

00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:51,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">what it was yesterday or what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

683
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:53,380
today I mean it's constantly evolving so

684
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:56,470
where it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mirror who knows I</font>

685
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:58,090
mean the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yahoo position is you know one</font>

686
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,790
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are waiting to see how this</font>

687
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:02,379
whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> shake out shakes out it</font>

688
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:05,918
certainly makes for great television and

689
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:07,780
you know a dramatic discussion but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

690
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,780
know that's a long would it responds to

691
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:12,489
a simple question I bottom line I don't

692
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:19,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">envision something like that happening</font>

693
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:21,009
oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right yeah go ahead one maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

694
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,719
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to propose a more realistic</font>

695
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:24,359
example because unfortunately that

696
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,560
substitution you're likely to get caught

697
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:27,730
AOL could certainly do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because they</font>

698
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,290
have proxies and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth</font>

699
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,389
everybody else could pretty much do the

700
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:33,550
same thing much more insidious would be

701
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:35,210
hey my marketing people tell me that

702
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:38,179
Yahoo's contract is coming

703
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:40,099
for review with their<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP and we see</font>

704
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:41,179
them as a sales opportunity well there

705
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:44,599
were kind of the underdog because our

706
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:47,659
prices<font color="#E5E5E5"> are high never had that happen so</font>

707
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:49,700
what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it well let's let's</font>

708
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:51,950
start at our border Reuters deliberately

709
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:53,658
dropping packets randomly if they are

710
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:55,129
sourced by yahoo so the performance

711
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:58,970
towards our customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not as good as</font>

712
00:34:55,129 --> 00:35:01,009
say someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else's in a connectivity to</font>

713
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,390
the customers would naturally be and we

714
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:04,070
go to yahoo and we can say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know your</font>

715
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,140
connectivity to our customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind</font>

716
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,700
of weak because your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP sucks they're</font>

717
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:09,230
not upgrading at the i-x or<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

718
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:11,810
connecting only at internet exchanges

719
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:14,270
which are weak or overloaded or using

720
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,890
giga switches or whatever here's a free

721

connection for you for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> month see if</font>

722
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:19,190
your connectivity improves when using

723
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,990
this reconnection come back in a month

00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">your connectivity has improved doesn't</font>

725
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:24,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">hasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it I mean our customers love this</font>

726
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,939
why don't we work<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a deal we'll even</font>

727
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,830
give you a discount because you're such

728
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,440
an important key account I've actually

729
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:31,910
seen this sort of thing happen I've also

730
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,550
seen it in such a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this has been</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">applied towards whole ISPs who are</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">choosing between one major carrier and</font>

at a time and most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers</font>

737
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,720
don't notice nobody has visibility into

00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,160
your Reuters you can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> prove that</font>

739
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,598
it isn't what you're claiming ie that

00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">the infrastructure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the network is</font>

741
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:55,040
overloaded you can do this kind of thing

742
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,830
and get away with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because no one has</font>

743

visibility into it the ad replacement

00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:01,520
isn't hypothetical either it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

ads that you see on TV are not the

back oh absolutely I just point that out

that the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists to radians or</font>

back to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue about the is an</font>

00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:54,950
excuse um not being a carrier but being

788
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:59,450
a former carrier oh it's so probably

789
00:37:54,950 --> 00:38:04,669
debatable that if you're a conspiracy

791
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:09,920
a big believer in capitalism that if the

earlier with that in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a choice</font>

797
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:23,839
of broadband providers where i live i

798
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,330
have actually five broadband providers

799
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,700
that can pick from and i know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

800
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:30,950
little bit unusual but i think for a lot

801
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:33,350
of major metropolitan markets in this

802
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,759
country<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think in Europe and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Asia</font>

803
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:37,759
as well you're starting to get more and

804
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:40,310
more providers and didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> also this</font>

805
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,080
whole municipal Wi-Fi thing that's

806
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:44,870
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> into play that's kind of a</font>

807
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,430
probably a dark horse that who knows how

808
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:49,310
that's going to also affect this

809
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:51,649
argument<font color="#CCCCCC"> not much trolley goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

810
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:53,870
often start having the municipal<font color="#CCCCCC"> wifis</font>

811
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:57,770
that assume they provide decent service

812
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:58,630
how does that affect this argument about

813
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,950
them

814
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:04,430
well interestingly that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the next</font>

815
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:06,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">question so do we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all agree that both</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">network neutrality and low coupon</font>

00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:11,450

00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:14,710
competition if we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> competition do</font>

819
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:14,710
either of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things matter anymore</font>

820
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:23,119
well I think competition<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps resolve</font>

821
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:25,339
this issue because<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know an end</font>

822
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,890
user can decide well do I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

823
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:31,490
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> option A which is going to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

824
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:34,580
more active role in adjusting the knobs

825
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:37,098
on my user experience versus going<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

826
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:39,140
an option b which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay</font>

827
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:43,220
uninvolved with adjusting you know my

828
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:44,660
user experience so competition generally

829
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,060
is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing when you have a monopoly</font>

830
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,279
in a market then you know you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:51,670
deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all the issues that you know</font>

832
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:55,130
come along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in some</font>

833
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:57,589
countries where there is only one choice

834
00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:03,099
and and you have to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that</font>

835
00:39:57,589 --> 00:40:06,770
monopoly you don't always have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

836
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:08,869
the benefit of innovation and the drive

837
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:11,060
to innovate and improve your your

839
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:15,920

840
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:19,460
continue to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">competition in in that space one of the</font>

842
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:24,710
things that concerns me you know

843
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:28,759
personally a little bit about that in

844
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:31,970
the content space is that if if I only

845
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:34,640
have one option to get to a huge user

846
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:39,220
base and that option is going to be more

847
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:43,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">expensive for me than what I might see</font>

848
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:45,649
as a solution to get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> other users then</font>

price elasticity is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to rear its</font>

850
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:50,240
ugly head I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have to adjust my</font>

851
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:52,599
user experience based on how much it

852
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,759
costs to deliver<font color="#CCCCCC"> that user experience to</font>

853
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:57,260
that user base and I don't know if

854
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,320
that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the internet and</font>

around that neutrality one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

860
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:17,000

that stuff is available peer-to-peer

863
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:24,109
being asked by our users to stream

higher and higher bitrate video and

865
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:28,250
content and we have to incur great

866

see then we will likely have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to throttle</font>

back on what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is an</font>

870
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:41,029
organization and I'm sure other smaller

871
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,980
companies that don't have the economies

872
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:45,650
of scale that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the likes of</font>

873
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:48,170
Yahoo or Google or other limelight etc

874
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:50,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">or other companies have you know they're</font>

875
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:52,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be in a</font>

876
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:55,670
situation where<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's the best they</font>

877
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,580
can do to deliver a 28 feet of the video

878
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:01,910
rather than a one Meg feed so i think

879
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:03,860
i'm going to try and start<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrapping this</font>

880
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,779
up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> since we're kind of running into</font>

881
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:08,690
lunch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to run down the</font>

882
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:11,990
panel<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quickly and try and get a</font>

883
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:14,240
sense so three choices here do we have

884
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:17,060
competition right now sufficient

885
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,990
competition do we need more regulation

886
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:24,140
or do we need more competition yeah

887
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:28,959
broke up I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do have choice</font>

888
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:32,299
although we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

889
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:35,600
consolidation right now underlying

890
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:38,660
carriers behind cable companies look a

891
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:40,759
lot like the providers for or the

892
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,190
incumbent in that market as well and and

893
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,100
so there is a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a consolidation</font>

894
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:47,750
though I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a free market and</font>

895
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:50,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll continue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to see</font>

896
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,460
motivation in the market to provide

897
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,380
competing services there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

898
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,730
technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are just on you know</font>

899
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,070
napkins right now that will likely

900
00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:00,470
become realities within the next five

901
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:02,750
years so what were the other questions

902
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:04,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was so do we already have</font>

903
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,740
competition yes enough competition or

904
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,660
more is better that we have competition

905
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:13,459
do we need more competition or do we

906
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:14,660
need more regulation regulation is is a

907
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,520
tough one

908
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:19,830
because i personally again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

909
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,180
speaking for yahoo here I think we've

910
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:25,410
all you know over beers you know

911
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,180
pontificated the whole idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know</font>

912
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:29,210
the same people that deliver mail or try

913
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:31,799
to deliver mail try to you know regulate

914
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:33,660
you know the internet but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same</font>

915
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,670
time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you know the audience and</font>

916
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:38,460
many of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends and colleagues will</font>

917
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:42,080
add excess partners or at content

918
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:46,460
providers you know are struggling with

919
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:50,130
what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end game here looks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

920
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:52,020
we are I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think as an organization as the</font>

North American network operator group I

922
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we all hope that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

923
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:58,890
continues to evolve and continues to

924
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:01,560
develop healthily whether or not that

925
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:03,240
pans out to be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case is pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

926
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:06,980
up to the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> either in this room or</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in in Washington right and</font>

928
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:12,480
sean is it fair to say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your for</font>

929
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:15,960
more competition do we have enough

930
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,210
competition the United States know do we

931
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,130
have enough regulation the United States

932
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:22,050
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have more than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough but all in the</font>

933
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:23,369
wrong direction it's telling you what

934
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:25,140
you should do in order to be a carrier

935
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,609
rather than allowing carriers to evolve

936
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:30,330
into particular niches in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

937
00:44:26,609 --> 00:44:31,830
marketplace and unfortunately it seems

938
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this issue has been really seized</font>

939
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:35,098
upon by the Congress who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are making it a</font>

940
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,050
big issue introducing bills all over the

941
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:39,480
place and it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

942
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:43,680
do for<font color="#CCCCCC"> network neutrality and utility</font>

943
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:46,349
what they've done for spam so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

944
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">not hopeful that the regulatory</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font>

945
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:50,250
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go anywhere in this country</font>

946
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:55,369
anytime sooner that a major change in

947
00:44:50,250 --> 00:45:00,030
the philosophy<font color="#CCCCCC"> of regulation shar'dama</font>

948
00:44:55,369 --> 00:45:05,099
so my view is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the regulation tends</font>

949
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:06,390
to to freeze things as a status quo it

950
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:09,089
doesn't actually give you more

951
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:11,640
competition and and if we want more

952
00:45:09,089 --> 00:45:15,630
competition if we don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

953
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:17,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough now we need to work on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

954
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:20,790
regulation that that gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> us effective</font>

955
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:22,379
competition rather than just different

956
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:26,690
brand names for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for the same</font>

957
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:28,940
product so regulation is very good

958
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:30,980
for for saying well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as you have</font>

959
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,630
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different brand names or four</font>

960
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:37,310
different brand names all song the same

961
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:41,569
thing that's not real competition even

962
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:45,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it may look like that so my view</font>

963
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:47,660
is regulation is useful but again it has

964
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:49,490
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> direction and right</font>

965
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:54,310
now it seems to be going in the wrong

966
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:57,290
direction it seems to be going trying to

967
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:59,270
to make everything a look-alike rather

968
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:03,349
than then rewarding things that look

969
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:04,640
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in terms of the first</font>

970
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:06,710
question about is there enough

971
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,328
competition or there's more competition

972
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:12,740
needed it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a good kind of both</font>

973
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:15,380
because like the example I gave you

974
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:17,328
earlier that where I live I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

975
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:20,390
facilities based broadband providers

976
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:22,099
which admittedly is unusual but then I

977
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:23,960
know there are plenty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other parts of</font>

978
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:26,300
the country and in North America that

979
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,490
actually have no broadband providers at

980
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:31,430
all so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess the answer there is</font>

981
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:32,959
twenty twenty percent in theory twenty

982
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:36,529
percent of Americans have no access to

983
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,060
broadband hmm yeah I guess in kajang we

984
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:40,190
break<font color="#E5E5E5"> down my demographics or geography</font>

985
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:42,759
or whatever so I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> answered there</font>

986
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:46,640
woody is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the answer depends on</font>

987
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:52,250
situation and terms of regulation<font color="#CCCCCC"> known</font>

988
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:56,180
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'll pass on that one yeah what</font>

989
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:58,640
did speaking of rope yeah Michael um

990
00:46:56,180 --> 00:47:02,149
Michael<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sinatra UC Berkeley I have one</font>

991
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:04,759
just quick and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm very hungry so very</font>

992
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:06,980
quick response to the baseball analogy

993
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:10,940
in the ad substitution in the case of

994
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:14,180
the baseball analogy the<font color="#E5E5E5"> baseball games</font>

995
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:16,400
the service provider the TV station is

996
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:18,440
paying the content provider for the

997
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,060
content and in some cases they are even

998
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,140
negotiating with the content provider in

999
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:22,819
terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ads they're going to show</font>

1000
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:24,950
so all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff is done in advance</font>

1001
00:47:22,819 --> 00:47:26,270
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the important thing is you're paying</font>

1002
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:28,189
me for the content I'm Major League

1003
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:31,369
Baseball you're paying me for the

1004
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:33,050
content and you can put ads on that to

1005
00:47:31,369 --> 00:47:34,339
recoup some of that expense but the

1006
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,319
important thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're paying for the</font>

1007
00:47:34,339 --> 00:47:38,720
content if I'm providing content to you

1008
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:40,040
for free what right do you have to

1009
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,810
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that content</font>

1010
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,759
and change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ads that are on it you</font>

1011
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:47,150
know in a moral<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective I think</font>

1012
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:50,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's still an open question so what we</font>

1013
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:52,130
see is in that case so one size paying

1014
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:53,779
the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet we also see</font>

1015
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:56,570
where the user is paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the content</font>

1016
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:59,210
and and for a while we had all the big

1017
00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:01,370
race was dial-up accelerators we're

1018
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:04,400
allowed dial-up providers to increase

1019
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:06,200
the speed would essentially reformat the

1020
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,030
the pictures on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the download to make</font>

1021
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,790
them smaller to go across the dialogue

1022
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:13,790
so the user is paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font>

1023
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:16,790
experiences user also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any moral</font>

1024
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:22,990
rights to change the content as they

1025
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:22,990
receive it so there's like both sides

1026
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:28,790
Ted silly from sprint bill very soft

1027
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:30,950
pitch come on ask the hard questions so

1028
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:32,360
the incumbent ilex are going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend</font>

1029
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,649
billions and billions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> billions to</font>

1030
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:36,680
build out local infrastructure to

1031
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:38,360
deliver video services right but that

1032
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,859
video delivery service models going to

1033
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:43,310
change immensely in the next 10 years

1034
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:45,860
how do they recover their costs by

1035
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:48,380
charging their customers enough to pay

1036
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:50,510
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service but it's free market</font>

internet in a free market<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet I</font>

1038
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,450
don't have to pay them for that because

1039
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:56,030
I can go get that service wherever I

1040
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:58,279
want as the movie distribution channels

1041
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:02,150
change over the few next few years why

1042
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:05,420
do I pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> spc / 18 t4 when I can buy it</font>

1043
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:07,040

00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:38,330
is built on delivering you services

1057
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,920
these value-added services right he's

1058
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:41,210
got to justify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the billions he's going</font>

1059
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,250
to spend ripping his copper out of the

1060
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:44,600
ground to put fiber in right but I don't

1061
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:47,810
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy those value-added services</font>

1062
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:51,830
in 10 years it's put picture it this way

1063
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:52,970
so is it I it's I ms all over again

1064
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:55,430
except<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1065
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:58,580
different sector of the market is it the

1066
00:49:55,430 --> 00:50:00,529
government's job to guarantee us I think

1067
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,848
some people it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1068
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:05,630
people would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it that way oh</font>

1069
00:50:01,849 --> 00:50:07,250
yeah that's certainly true<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we're</font>

1070
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:11,810
now at sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions from the</font>

1071
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:15,380
audience obviously and late for lunch if

1072
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:18,049
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> any more questions I think yes</font>

1073
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:21,260
better hello Patrick Gill Martha Malcolm

1074
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:24,170
I if the providers want to charge the

1075
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:26,270
content it's our if the telco providers

1076
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:29,859
want to charge the content owners for

1077
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:31,880
delivering their content how much of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1078
00:50:29,859 --> 00:50:33,680
provider is going to charge each other

1079
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,050
for delivering all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stolen content</font>

1080
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,279
that they're trading back and forth I'm

1081
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:38,960
just wondering since that's the

1082
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,430
overwhelming majority of most people's

1083
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,430
traffic when they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> give stats</font>

1084
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:49,670
yeah I think that was a rhetorical

1085
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:53,530
question right yeah thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1086
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:53,530
we'll turn it back over to Steve
