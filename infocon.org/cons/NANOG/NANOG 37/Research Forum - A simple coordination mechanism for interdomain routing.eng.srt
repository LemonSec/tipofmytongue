00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,678
simple coordination mechanism for inter

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,179
domain routing and my motivation for

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,430
presenting this work here is because I

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,630
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feedback from this</font>

8
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,279

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,198
coordination mechanism is useful in

10
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,750
rather not these pains are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

about are actually existing or any of

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,670
them up so the nature of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,500
ordering today is that ISPs work in a

14
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,450
contractual framework and contracts for

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,280
instance would specify that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

16
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,260
advertise for a particular route across

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,730
all hearing links and be willing to

18
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,940
accept traffic for particular

19
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,260
destinations across all<font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remains what</font>

20
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,849
happens within such a contractual

21
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,039
framework is that ice please select

22
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,079
paths that are best<font color="#E5E5E5"> for themselves for</font>

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">instance in this simple example with two</font>

24
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,430
isps and three interconnections and

25
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,590
traffic going there from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Blue Dot to</font>

26
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,210
the round out the blue ice P would take

27
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,070
her into connection that is closes so

28
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,469
this is hot potato routing is an example

29
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,349
of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP selecting path that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is best</font>

30

00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,798
<font color="#CCCCCC">selects this path and this is the nature</font>

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,470
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routing that would emerge in this</font>

33
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,180

<font color="#CCCCCC">rocking framework has its potential</font>

35
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,890
downsides one is like that I speeds have

36
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,229
little control over the incoming traffic

37
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,090
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted to operate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

38

congestion free network you require a

39
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,960
much higher bandwidth provisioning since

40
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,758
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have control over how traffic</font>

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,740
might enter your network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

42
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,390
provision for a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse cases if</font>

43
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,030

49
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,798
automated way today to fix that that I

50
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,169
know so that requires manual to tweaking

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,450
to fix such egregiously bad problems

52
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,350
that might arise arise note but not very

53
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">common but they may arise sometimes and</font>

54
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think general the paths would be</font>

55
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,750
somewhat inefficient because again

56
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,220
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spees every is be along the</font>

57
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,260
way is making a green

00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">path selection</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like three or four eyes</font>

59
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,920
peas in general so these are the

60
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,490
potential downsides of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nature of</font>

Internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> roaring are today so what I'm</font>

62
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,310
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about is an alternative</font>

63
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">approach that i'm going to call</font>

64
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,540
coordinated routing in coordinated

65
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,880
routing ISPs have joined control over

66
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,739
path selection both the receivers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

67
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,100
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and centers of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic as</font>

68
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,630
some say in what paths get selected so

69
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,730
an example of coordinate<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolling here</font>

70
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,590
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that the blue-ice p and</font>

71
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,299
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jazz we have joint control and</font>

72
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,190
they decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a path that is shorter</font>

73
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,050
than the greedy path selection of the

74
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,600
hot potato routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i talked about and</font>

75
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,450
similarly this path can result in the

76
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,070
opposite direction what might be the

77
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,810
benefits of such an approach they

78
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:47,700
followed from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential downsides of</font>

79
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,830
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach that is taking today lower</font>

80
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,959
bandwidth provisioning again because now

81
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have some control of how traffic</font>

82
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,100
enters your network and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only how it</font>

83
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,050
leaves so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a mechanism that i am</font>

84
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,760
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> skyraider but you have a way</font>

85
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,560
using which you can influence our

86
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,019
traffic enters your network and you can

87
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,050
steer the traffic away from parts of the

88
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">network that are likely to get loaded</font>

89
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,440
there would be no egregious cases that

90
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,360
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> require manual cleaning because of</font>

91
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">because all I spes have control each of</font>

92
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,280
them can fix the path by themselves and

93
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,230
the end-to-end paths will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more</font>

94
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,450
efficient as a result and this can also

95
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,119
form the basis of inter domain quality

96
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,280
of service as you'll see will describe

97
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,959
later so assuming we actually want

98
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,660
quadrant adoring because of all its

99
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,299
upsides can we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that using mechanisms</font>

100
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,040
today this way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that I will</font>

101
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:36,930
talk about two common mechanisms and say

102
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,910
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are insufficient to implement</font>

103
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,160
it the point of<font color="#CCCCCC"> coordinate adoring and</font>

104
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,900
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about when is route optimization</font>

105
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,480
boxes the kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the kind you might</font>

106
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,160
get from internap or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob signs which</font>

107
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,798
would state estaba SP and pick an

108
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,180
outgoing path route optimization boxes

109
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,940
are actually solving a different problem

110
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,020
they are enabling stubble speeds to pick

111
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,579
better routes among

112
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,500
was available they are not creating

113
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,490
better options in the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself so</font>

114
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,140
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got three or four options</font>

115
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,670
depending on the number of providers or

116
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">uplinks you have and the route</font>

117
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">optimization box will let you pick what</font>

118
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:09,060
it's not doing it is not creating better

119
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,430
it's not finding better paths in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

120
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,580
network such as those in the middle

121
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">indicate connection in their example</font>

122
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:19,770
another mechanism is mad men's actually

123
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,750
implement cold potato routing instead of

124
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">hot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peddling and do not provide joint</font>

125
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,840
control itself and so here's an example

126
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:30,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's on the left I've shown routing</font>

127
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,010
that emerges without meds with meds what

128
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,260
would happen the orange RSP would

129
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:38,039
specify preferences in rotting messages

130
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,990
and what results<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this particular path</font>

131
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,330
over here again what you're getting now

132
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,340
is a path that is best<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the receiving</font>

133
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,590
RSP and you're not getting joint control

134
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,570
and if both high speeds were using meds

135
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,940
in this particular example the routing

136
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,640
you get is just the opposite of hot

137
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,930
potato routing and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not getting</font>

138
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:59,070
the middle interconnection which offers

139
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,810
better paths in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so suppose</font>

140
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,400
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to invent something different</font>

141
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,990
or implement something different let's

142
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,549
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like what would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually be a</font>

143
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,290
good coordination mechanism if you

144
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:09,030
wanted to implement it in my opinion

145
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,980
meds in reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have some really</font>

146
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,619
nice properties that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want in a</font>

147
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,090
coordination mechanism one is that using

148
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,490
meds I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spees can express their own</font>

149
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,140

describe the coordination mechanism it's

187
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:42,139
i'll describe wiser in the context of

please consider this simple example

again to ice please three

about let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are cost metrics</font>

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:00,619

00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:15,259
lowest cost rate rocking framework not

204
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:17,269
very different from bgp for instance so

205
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,459
the destination<font color="#E5E5E5"> is PR the receiving isp</font>

206
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:21,769
advertises its costs so again these are

207
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:23,839
kind of like meds opaque numbers that

208
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:25,999
blue I speak cannot interpret in terms

209
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,009
of how they were derived and what the

210
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:31,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">blue ice PETA's are the sending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP does</font>

211
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:34,519
it selects paths based on both the cost

212
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:36,139
it recedes and its internal<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost so it's</font>

213
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:38,209
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like rotting today where it takes</font>

214
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,399
into account only<font color="#E5E5E5"> its own post</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font>

215
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:42,079
it's not like routing with meds where it

216
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:44,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">takes into account only the receivers</font>

217
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,369
cost it's actually combining the cost of

218
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:48,688
its own cost and the cost of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> orange</font>

219
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:52,739
I speak to pick the path

220
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:54,239
but sure I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not but their</font>

221
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:56,789
problems so what I've described so far

222
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:58,318
is just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Louis cause routing but</font>

223
00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:00,360
Louis first roaring or the plain vanilla

224
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,949
Louis was rotting in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet has</font>

225
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,439
its problems when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and apply it</font>

226
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:06,299
globally first of all I said I spes are

227
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,729
deriving their metrics or they cost

228
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:10,198
independently so what that means is is

229
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:12,449
because could be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> very different</font>

230
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,799
ranges the way meds are today some ISPs

231
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:15,749
could be assigning their costs within

232
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:18,119
the range thousand to two thousand and

233
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:20,759
otherwise we might be using<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 hundred</font>

234
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:22,589
in which case once you bring

235
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,569
incomparable<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs together in a simple</font>

236
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:26,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">rocking framework the the ice be</font>

237
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,529
that assigns higher cost ranges actually

238
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,599
wins out suppose you were minimizing the

239
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:32,519
sum of the cost or some simple thing so

240
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,078
I speak as being incomparable and them

241
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,060
assigning<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs independently as</font>

242
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:38,159
actually a problem the other problem is

243
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,869
the system can be easily game again

244
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,578
since the costs are incomparable you can

245
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,769
game the system by just assigning your

246
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:45,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost that benefits you more and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lose</font>

247
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:49,079
the property of both joint control and

248
00:08:45,689 --> 00:08:50,790
mutually beneficial routing so in the

249
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:52,829
next two slides I'll I'll quickly

250
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,420
describe how I solve those problems and

251
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:57,689
then we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have wiser works in the</font>

252
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,759
jungle case so the first mechanism that

253
00:08:57,689 --> 00:09:01,740
throw in on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Louis Pasteur out in</font>

254
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,569
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost normalization and the problem</font>

255
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,100
here is easy to see suppose these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

256
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:08,849
the same numbers that were there on the

257
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,290
example and and this is the routing that

258
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,939
would emerge if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> blue-ice we was</font>

259
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,519
taking its own<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and the orange is</font>

260
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:16,379
peace crossed into wrong what the

261
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:18,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">oranges we can do is just inflates is</font>

262
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:19,709
caused by a factor of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's no</font>

263
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:21,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">way to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent that because crossed</font>

264
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,550
assignment remember is independent in

265
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:25,529
which case this particular routing good

266
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">emerged and now what has happened is</font>

267
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:29,459
routing is lot more favorable to the

268
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:32,730
orange is P so system can be gained and

269
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:34,920
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> blue is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> P is forced to implement</font>

270
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,019
whole potato rolling the solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

271
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is what I call cost normalization</font>

272
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:40,559
which means that I would normalize the

273
00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:41,878
cause such that both<font color="#CCCCCC"> highest please have</font>

274
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,790
an equal say that's the intuition behind

275
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:46,649
it and one potential way to do that is

276
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,899
to normalize them such that the sum of

277
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:51,509
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs that blue is P announces to</font>

278
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,180
the orange one and the orange is<font color="#E5E5E5"> P</font>

279
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,640
announces to

blue one be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same so after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I apply</font>

281
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,260
such normalization to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost that</font>

283
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,339
become point 72 and 7.3 what has

284
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,230
happened as a result the cost of the

285
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:06,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">blue I see an orange is B have now</font>

286
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,980
become comparable and they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

287
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,870
compared directly and this particular

288
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,000
routing would emerge and we're back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

289
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:16,149
this case what cost normalization does

290
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,580
it also it makes the system harder to

291
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,529
game and it also but but at the same

292
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,540
time retaining flexibility orange I

293
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:24,700
speak and assign whatever cost it wants

294
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it can assign whatever relative cost</font>

please even if they assign completely

305
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,050
stop the sender's from not listening two

306
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,850

307
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,800
particular example the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue ice we can</font>

308
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,600
keep sending the traffic across the

309
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,189
bottom link which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best for itself</font>

310
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,020
and the solution to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular</font>

311
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem also happens to be very simple</font>

312
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm simply going to say that the</font>

313
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:05,950
downstream I speed log what paths are

314
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:07,870
being used and based on those log they

315
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,940
can compute the ratio of average cost

316
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,130
that so the downstream<font color="#CCCCCC"> highs me in this</font>

317
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,140
case is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the orange ice cream so based on</font>

318
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,270
the logs they can compute the ratio of

321
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,820
paths that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are announced and what I'm</font>

322
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,529
going to propose<font color="#E5E5E5"> then is that you</font>

323
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,779
contractually stipulate a bound on the

00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:33,489
those two particular interconnections

328
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,040
basically the ratio is a lot lower if

329
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,540
the upstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> P</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or the traffic sender</font>

and this this particular contraction

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">clause is not very different from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what I</font>

338
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,170
understand major eyes

339
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,120
is due today with respect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to traffic</font>

340
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,709
ratios that the traffic i sent<font color="#CCCCCC"> you over</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a fading link and the traffic you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sent</font>

342
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,610
to me overly should be within a factor

343
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,430
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two or a four and so very similar</font>

344
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,780
clause and it buys us it keeps eyes peas

345
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,050
honest in this particular setting as

346
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,819
well so now extending this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isp</font>

347
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,380

348
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,780
straightforward consider this to be the

349
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet and the destination and it</font>

350
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:22,689
works very much like DGP in fact so is

351
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,699
so uh Saudi here is the destination<font color="#CCCCCC"> G is</font>

352
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,350
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s path and c1 is the cost i'm</font>

353
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,110
talkin verve so the green eyes be here

354
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,480
starts off bgp advertisement<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bgp like</font>

355
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:33,910
advertisements what happens next is as

356
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,520
soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as these are we received into the</font>

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:39,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">networks they are normalized based into</font>

358
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,890
into units or into cost ranges that are

359
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,800
meaningful internally to this orange

360
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,780
high speed while passing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost on it</font>

361
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,780
just adds on the normalized<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and its</font>

362
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,250
internal path cost so<font color="#E5E5E5"> c3 is basic which</font>

363
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,900
is announced a to the blue ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font>

364
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,180
simply see one dash which comes from

365
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:58,240
here plus the internal path cost of this

366
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:00,880
internal path the blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> ice p imports all</font>

367
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,100
these just all this cost it normalizes

368
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,210
this fast again<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs normalization is</font>

369
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,640
happening based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pairwise</font>

370
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,410
relationship between ISPs and it

371
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,210
normalizes this and one nice thing that

372
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,670
happens through normalization now you

373
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,350
can compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> c4 dash and c5 dash can be</font>

374
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,209
compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each other because both of</font>

376
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,480
that are meaningful to the blue eyes

peeled this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you cannot</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">on its path selection it looks at that</font>

383
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,630
and picks a path that will base this

384
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:37,630
cost in particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> so its operating very</font>

385
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:39,300
much like DDT and here's how it performs

386
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,590
so these results are just

387
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,240
simulation-based results over measure

388
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,010
internet apologies so these are not

389
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,230
random graphs these are internet

390

apologies of ISPs that have been

391
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,640
measured and the left graph here is

392
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,829
describing how much it might help you

393
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,660
with over-provisioning the black line<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

394
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,820
with DGP and the red is<font color="#E5E5E5"> with visor and</font>

395
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,170
the experiment tried to say if there are

396
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,820
some random perturbations in the

397
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,380
networks such as link failures

398
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,640
the control that visor provides you how

399
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,470
much it saves you in terms of

400
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,140
provisioning the network so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

401
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,339
showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the difference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is showing</font>

402
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,839
and the provisioning was measured

403
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:13,310
relative to stable load so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

404
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,830
showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on average you have eight to ten</font>

405
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:18,109
percent provisioning advantage in this

406
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:21,200
particular it's with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the set of</font>

407
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,670
topologies and experiment so so that's

408
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,290
basically saying the washer requires

409
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,959
lower bandwidth provisioning one of the

410
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,399
original hypothesis have talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

411
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:30,439
the right graph here is talking about

412
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,600
path length what it shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the black</font>

413
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,480
line is again bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> red is wiser it shows</font>

414
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,190
the path length how much higher the path

415
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,380
length is related to the shortest path

416
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,240
in the network so what it shows here is

417
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,370
that most while most of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pads are not</font>

418
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,810
longer there for about ten percent of

419
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,490
the paths<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> locked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> longer with</font>

420
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,170
bgp and now they are automatically

421
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,480
shorter with wiser no manual training

422
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:53,060
required to fix even paths that were way

423
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,920
long hair is right here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tail like</font>

424
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,569
some password as long as six times the

425
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,120
shortest path length and these are not

426
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:01,010
just short paths I got seemed like 20

427

milliseconds path being expanded 200

428
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,790
milliseconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so just because a greedy</font>

00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:06,800
fat selection that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens but wiser</font>

430
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:09,800
does a good job at fixing all of these

completely bgp as you might guess from

438

the devices like the wiser graphic slide

478
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,459
just ask two questions actually they're

479
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:14,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting first question is on the</font>

480
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:15,190
normalization how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you actually do</font>

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

482
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:20,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">Elias be so so you say to do</font>

483
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">normalization on a pairwise basis we are</font>

484
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,500
in today's naas how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you actually</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">know more what's that raised so this in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">prototype implementation not so both</font>

488
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,320
these ice pieces so think of it this way

489
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,780
rotting advertisements are going from

490
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,580
both eyes peace in either direction so

491
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,560
normalization happens based on the some

492
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,510
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are announcing to</font>

493

494
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:50,050
announcing to you I'm saying how do you

495
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">derive the values for that they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

496
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,770
like with<font color="#E5E5E5"> man sorry for example some</font>

497
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,240
people place it on propagation<font color="#E5E5E5"> delay of</font>

498
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,370
the link time for some factor link

499
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,960
bandwidth a vision oh I see so in my

500
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,790
experiments are derived it based on what

501
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,220
I was evaluating in some cases it was

502
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,770
simply length of the link in other cases

503
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:08,710
it was a combination of the metric you

504
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,720
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> take in some of the cases it was</font>

505
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:12,880
basically later the combination<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

506
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,890
utilization and latency is a short

507
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,480
answer and there were different exact

508
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,520
weights could be placed on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fencing</font>

510
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,730
match for example garage

511
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,399
applied something intelligence that<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

512
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,080
based on for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp metric to</font>

513
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,409
the next top of the point of an airlock

514
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,059
something that's so yes but<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

515
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,830
metrics also have to be based on

516
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:36,799
something like latency is what I mean so

517
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:39,320
the implementation actually uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

518
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:44,720
metrics but<font color="#E5E5E5"> given a topology also have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">parody I think I can answer Danis</font>

521
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,799
question whatever your metrics offer

522
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:54,340
you're giving me set of metrics across

523
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lines</font>

524
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,530
is your<font color="#CCCCCC"> business how do</font>

525
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,770
yeah but that's that's yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it</font>

526
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:25,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well look on slide on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide 11 you</font>

527
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,929
had something you said there were 20

528
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:32,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the propagation delay saving</font>

529
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,850
then you

530
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,090
with those numbers so these experiments

531
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">are basically based on measured i SPECT</font>

532
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,559
apologies two years ago I had this

533
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,290
project where I would go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

534
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">measure I sweet apologies and on top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

535
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,550
the ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> feat apologies what you can do</font>

536
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:53,830
is you can mimic bgp like route

537
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:55,450
selection so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers are coming</font>

538
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,460
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what would happen if you would</font>

539
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,200
doing DGP like default policy route

540
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,940
selection where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> prefer customers</font>

541
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">peers providers in that order and</font>

542
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:06,220
compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the shortest path in</font>

543
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:08,080
the topology and the route and the path

544
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:13,260
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would appear with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> visor so these</font>

545
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,260
numbers are based on that apology

546
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:21,610
it's so this is the length of the data

547
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:24,540
path so I don't understand the point

548
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,540
about control plane

549
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:32,559
um we've read the rocket fuel papers the

550
00:20:28,989 --> 00:20:35,229
point is what would have happened if you

551
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a hot potato what would have been</font>

552
00:20:35,229 --> 00:20:37,679
your path

553
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,880
if you

554
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,879
his visor and up

555
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,020
it will choose shorter<font color="#E5E5E5"> pair</font>

556
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,490
what's the

557
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:55,740
savings on the shorter pants

558
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,510
I believe retro tool was saying even

559
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,290
though we did the word was he based it

560
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:01,879
on the old rocket tunity yeah

561
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:04,690
thanks Ryan you're much better at

562
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,690
answering the questions

563
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,560
now I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember my question</font>

564
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:29,039
oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember it yeah yeah vendors this</font>

565
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:31,220
is cool stuff open your ears oh thank

566
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,220
you
