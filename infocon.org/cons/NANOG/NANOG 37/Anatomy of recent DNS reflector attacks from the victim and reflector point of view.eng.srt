buying out the amplification factor and

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that this five gig attack</font>

101
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,239
interestingly this domain had two

it gets broken up into three fragments

and the attacker sets the destination of

the port of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack by setting the</font>

116
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:39,820
it came in three phases the blue is

<font color="#E5E5E5">destination port 666 the yellow is 53</font>

119
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:49,060
666 then shifted to split between 66 and

120
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:50,200
53 and then it shifted to all port 53 if

121
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,000
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the graph you can see if the</font>

122
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,769

<font color="#E5E5E5">nearly instant stop is nearly instant</font>

00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,080
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the changes were nearly instant</font>

125
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,620
which indicates a pretty tight command

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,750
and control<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the origination of this</font>

127
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,580
so a lot of talk has gone on in various

128
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,980
forums about what victims<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do for</font>

129
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,090
filtering techniques one of the things

130
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,100
that's been discussed is filtering out

131
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,600
open recursive DNS servers the problem

132
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,109
is how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put an ACL on a router to</font>

133
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,130
handle to block 500,000 / 32 s and even

134
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,630
if you want to with a black ball route

135
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,279

that if your route until the operator

253
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,410
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty pretty</font>

DDoS attack with this using less than to

256
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,750
gig of traffic to initiate the attack so

257
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,539
we've looked at a distribution of the

258
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:13,430

received over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the duration of the attack</font>

260
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,150
which is why this graph does now the

261
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,220
title that's a pretty big title you can

262
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,750
see the top victim got<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 130,000</font>

263
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,220
queries over the duration which again

264
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,590
you go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the math of 30,000</font>

out there to use as reflectors but other

UDP protocols need to be looked at as

well anything that anything that UDP

thereof someone's that we think are

from being used as a reflector in this

352
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:11,130
and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem gets even harder</font>

353
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,360
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of these aren't real DNS</font>

354
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,459
servers that you can actually secure

355
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,769
their dsl modems and cable routers and

356
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:18,329
so hope firewalls that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have dns proxies</font>

that listen on the public interface by

360
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,300
at and another fundamental problem of

00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,680
DNS is<font color="#CCCCCC"> our fundamental</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge and</font>

362
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,180
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS is that there are a</font>

number of technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are emerging</font>

00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:40,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">all things that depend on large records</font>

368
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:43,800
of various types in the DNS

369
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,360
infrastructure so when we look beyond

370
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,459
the open recursive DNS servers and we

371
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,889
assume that lets say by some magic<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> managed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to close to 500,000 the</font>

this now that's 437 bite response if

376

you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a nice beat it isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:32,899
answer you get is well it's a big

problem it's a long time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix it it's</font>

431
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:36,259
hard and expensive and I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

break things and we absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree</font>

433
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:40,639
that is a hard problem to fix however if

434
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:41,959
we don't ever start making progress on

435
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,429
this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're never going to fix it</font>

00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:45,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> graph on the bottom is just</font>

traffic from them on a daily basis so in

the outside interface and really the

454
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:21,079
only thing that will ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve this</font>

455
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:22,339
problem is bc<font color="#CCCCCC"> p38 until we can stop the</font>

459

these kinds of attacks so that takes us

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,939
the end of presentation and questions

461
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,529
typically one of the first questions I

462
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,939
get is what is verisign doing to protect

463
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:39,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root and TL</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the infrastructure that</font>

464
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:41,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">we run to support this so we're doing is</font>

465
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,610
massively building out capacity in terms

466
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:48,399
of adding any cast servers and adding

467
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,399
transit and carrying capacity so

468
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,980
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jared much NTT America so so in doing</font>

469
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:00,989
the transit for Nana guy decided that

470
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:04,350
would be evil and turn on unicast RPF on

471
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:06,839
the interface and it looks like there's

472
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:09,120
about three hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and seventy two</font>

473
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:11,130
thousand packets that people who are

474
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,990
here have generated that have failed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

476
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:19,020
your machines so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that brings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up an</font>

477
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,390
interesting point with RPF and bcp 30th

<font color="#CCCCCC">bcp 38 is hard to deploy and I think</font>

480
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,940
maybe if we don't have the features we

481

need we need to work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our vendors to</font>

sorry Mike wandering about the address

489
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:57,779
ranges in the packet and were you

490
00:15:55,589 --> 00:16:03,810
actually seeing any packets in 20 count

491
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:06,209
so the my name is Bora are killed I'm

492
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,250
from broadcom sorry about not saying it

493
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:10,500
earlier I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to know if you had</font>

494
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,870
any date on the source ranges of the

495
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:17,550
packets that you're seeing III could

496
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:20,190
potentially look in the one in 10,000

497
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,420
sampled NetFlow data that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

498
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:25,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">look and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see what i could potentially</font>

499
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:28,170
find over the couple days but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you</font>

500
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,170
know by so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the individual linkage that</font>

501
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,219
basically a / 30 point-to-point<font color="#E5E5E5"> link so</font>

502
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,099
to me it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like a normal</font>

503
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,200
customer link like anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah</font>

504
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,670
I'm not seeing any extra broadcast

505
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,800
traffic or anything else so this is

506
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,180
packets that are being sourced by people

507
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,540
here and are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the merit</font>

00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,620
in you either on their<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers so maybe</font>

510
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:51,360
they should do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as well but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

511
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,399
