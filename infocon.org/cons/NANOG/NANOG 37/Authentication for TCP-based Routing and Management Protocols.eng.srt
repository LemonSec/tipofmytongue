thanks

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,550
this is a joint presentation of some

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,850
work done collectively by<font color="#CCCCCC"> L català</font>

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:14,700
cisco and juniper and the history<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

5
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,700
this work starts at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nana and wash</font>

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,830
there was a security involved and

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:23,250
someone had mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,560
they would md5 authenticate their<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,990
peering sessions if there was a way to

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,790
update<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys without bouncing the bgp</font>

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,790
session well

12
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,890
I remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that comment</font>

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,589
later on

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,600
there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> another nanog</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think in</font>

15
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:43,010
seattle where

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,629
talked about how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were</font>

17
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:49,190
actually md5 authenticating<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP and</font>

18
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:52,339
surprisingly small number of people were

19
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:56,030
actually authenticating well how does

20
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:57,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that work another customer reminded us</font>

21
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,260
that we needed something better as far

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,430
as authenticating<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP peering and for</font>

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:08,110
that matter all tcp<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp based routing</font>

24
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,110
protocols so this work came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of this</font>

25
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:13,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">acha</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the motivation</font>

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,630
not enough operators

27
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:20,740
cating current practice RFC 2385

28
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,399
local operator requirements

29
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,860
and

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,960
basically there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons why</font>

31
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,930
they aren't using it one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU</font>

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,300
utilization<font color="#E5E5E5"> apologize for the first</font>

33
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,550
bullet there to these slides before it's

34
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,750
a joint presentation it's not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much in</font>

35
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:41,310
an issue for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Juniper or Cisco or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alcatel</font>

36
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:43,770
because forwarding and control

37
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,610
processors are separated so CPU

38
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,449
utilization

39
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,050
so much so much an issue he management

40
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,120
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an issue</font>

41
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:56,910
there is no way to refresh the

42
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,830
md5 key<font color="#E5E5E5"> without bouncing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp session</font>

43
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,899
correctly and the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

44
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:04,670
issue is the cryptography is weak there

45
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,670
are many<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-known attack 25</font>

46
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,299
so we need we knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> we needed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come up</font>

47
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:13,220
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> something better than RFC 2385 the</font>

48
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,560
question is what would it be would we do

49
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:19,450
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the application and the</font>

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,450
transport layer or in the network

51
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,730
we could have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocols</font>

52
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,819
on something

53
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:29,760
authentication and<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp something an ldp</font>

54
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">at msdp in fact pgp used to have an</font>

55
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication mechanism inside of it</font>

56
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:39,620
that was recently deprecated because

57
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:41,700
used it we could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> used TLS again</font>

58
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,060
authenticating at the application layer

59
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,489
and we decided against that because

60
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,340
although it would authenticate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

61
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,200
payload would bother people well it

62
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,260
would authenticate the BGP the TCP

63
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,019
payload it wouldn't authenticate the TCP

64
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">control information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we would still be</font>

65
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerable to things like blind</font>

66
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,900
insertion attacks where the reset bit is

67
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,540
set so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we decided not to authenticate at</font>

68
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,070
the application layer our two choices

69
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,459
were to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at the transport layer</font>

70
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:19,440
with yet another<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP option or to do it</font>

71
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:21,840
with a hike ipsec and we decided to go

72
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">the transport layer route</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll talk</font>

73
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,380
about why in a little bit but<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

74
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,329
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about why we made that decision</font>

75
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,600
let's talk about the solution we came up

76
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,600
with

77
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:42,390
the solution is characterized by a<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

78
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:45,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication option the option has in</font>

79
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:49,589
it a message authentication code and a

80
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,840
number the number identifies one of many

81
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,540
keys that could have been used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

82
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,200
generate the Mac now where do these many

00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,049
keys come from on both systems to

84
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,560
sending and receiving system we manually

00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:14,850
which key to use based on time it

88
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,159
generates the Mac it generates the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:19,079

92
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,130
chain looks for the appropriate key does

93
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,290
the

94
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,600
another characteristic<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we can use</font>

95
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,570
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stronger cryptography rather than</font>

97
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:39,900
max shell 196 CMAC aes-128 96 for that

98
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,310
matter we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use any authentication</font>

99
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:46,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">algorithm but these are the two that</font>

100
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,850
most recommend it

101
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:55,680
this is a look at the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp option</font>

102
00:04:53,060 --> 00:05:00,389
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a neat ECT option that starts with</font>

103
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:05,420
a kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a length the t NK bits we'll</font>

104
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:07,880
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in a little bit the</font>

105
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,130
algorithm ID tells you what algorithm we

106
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,560
use to generate the Mac the key ID tells

107
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:15,219
you which key off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the keychain we use to</font>

108
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,220
generate the Mac

109
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:25,020
so a look at the key chain keychain

110
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:27,600
contains up to 64<font color="#CCCCCC"> keys each Key has an</font>

111
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:30,900
identifier and<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication algorithm</font>

112
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,480
a shared secret and a start time and an

113
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,669
end time actually to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more accurate it</font>

114
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,040
has a start time and an end time both

115
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:40,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">for receiving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and transmitting and those</font>

116
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,900
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> typically the</font>

117
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,479
end time for receiving will specify a

118
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,609
wider window than the end time for

119
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,910
transmitting and that way we deal with

120
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,380
clock skew when the sending and

121
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,950
receiving systems have their clocks set

122
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,950
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little differently</font>

123
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,130
so

124
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,750
let's take a closer look at how the

125
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,750
authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheme works</font>

126
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:11,229
the sending systems first job he has a

127
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">tcp segment he wants to send out first</font>

128
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:16,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing he has to do is identify the</font>

129
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:19,140
active key on its on its key chain it

130
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,140
does that based on time

131
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,669
ok

132
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:27,498
a little closer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mic okay it</font>

133
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:29,969
identifies the act of key based on time

134
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:34,199
basically it's looking for a key whose

135
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:35,430
start times less than the current time

136
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,129
and end time greater than the current

137
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:40,319
time if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no candidate keys at</font>

138
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:42,990
all the sending system discards the

139
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,719
outbound bakit if there are multiple

140
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:51,349
candidates it selects the key with the

141
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:51,349
most recent start time for sending

142
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:56,759
having selected the active key it

143
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,949
calculates a Mac it calculates the Mac

144
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,800
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP pseudo header TCP header</font>

145
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:06,479
and TCP payload and by default<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

146
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,770
includes the TCP options except of

147
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,529
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the option that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

148
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:16,109

151
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,059
the options because you have some middle

152
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:26,550
box on the line if you set the tee bit

153
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:29,149
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the options are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:47,688
first thing it does is look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the key</font>

160
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:52,159
has that key if it doesn't it throws the

161
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:55,669
packet away next<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing it does is make</font>

162
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:59,389
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the key is not expired if it's</font>

167
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,370
received and it accepts the packet

168
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,448
otherwise it declares an authentication

169
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:17,509
error in the case of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication</font>

another from alcatel and we have another

Francisco but unfortunately I don't have

180
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,840
it on this slide deck so we'll update

181
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:59,109
the slide deck before it's posted to the

presentation before I open the floor to

184
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,480
questions I'd like to ask a couple

185
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:12,810
questions of the audience how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

186
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:18,160
you are authenticating ibgp sessions now

187
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:20,969
and how many are not well so the

188
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,020
majority are actually authenticating now

189
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:27,270
um how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

190
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:32,610
are interested in a better way to update

191
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:35,630
keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's the same girl okay open</font>

192
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,630
the floor to questions now

193
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:41,649
not at all

194
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:51,140
not one Russ<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bundy are you planning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

196
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,819
gets published through that process yes

197
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,670
it's already been introduced to the DC

198
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,550
p.m. working group was presented at our

the there were literally this was

designed for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF there were no</font>

Steve velvet Columbia University no

213
00:10:53,190 --> 00:11:00,570
longer security ad the idea two things

214
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:03,089
one and I know the questions come up on

215
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,850
the sack list you tell me more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about why</font>

216
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:08,430
you're rejecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can i pee sexes that</font>

217
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:12,030
does all this it really does far more

218
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:16,949
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deliver</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does what you're asking</font>

219
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:20,069
for two why not tie the algorithm to the

220
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:23,880
key get it out of the header it won't be

221
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:29,850
as for ID or something else<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

222
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:31,050
answer the first question<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second</font>

223
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,270
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> first since it's easier</font>

224
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:36,380
actually the algorithm could be taken

225
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,380
out of the key and put in

226
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,410
well actually let me clarify the

227
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,200
question you asking why the algorithm is

228
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:45,060
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP option as per Wyatt's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

229
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,120
key is what wise and why isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DCP</font>

230
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:51,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">options set of associated with the key</font>

231
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:54,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually that's the kind of comment</font>

232
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,100
that we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for in the ITF we</font>

233
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,410
argued both ways whether it should be in

234
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> option or not and I'm kind of up in</font>

235
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,550
the air as to whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wants to be or</font>

236
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,520
not one<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument for putting it there is</font>

237
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,859
it's a very quick way to check without

238
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:11,210
actually calculating a Mac so you can

239
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:14,690
throw away some some attack packets

240
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:16,950
before you've actually calculated a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac</font>

241
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,440
but personally I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> married to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

242
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:23,520
idea the second question is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

243
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,260
more interesting one why not<font color="#E5E5E5"> use Ike and</font>

244
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,510
here you're talking about Ike with just

245
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:30,250
authentication of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody they</font>

246
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:32,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">should just idle perceive</font>

247
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,330
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and out that most other people do a</font>

248
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:38,699
grave loot there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably no need for</font>

249
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:41,920
confidentiality we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

250
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:45,550
there were a couple possibilities one is

251
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,740
to just just use IPSec with<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre-shared</font>

252
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,890
keys but then you have the same problem

253
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:53,290
of having to roll<font color="#CCCCCC"> up roll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over the keys</font>

254
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:56,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need some way to either negotiate</font>

255
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:59,500
keys once you've done that you need some

256
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:03,400
way to authenticate as it turns out

257
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:05,920
those are all probably good ideas what

258
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,500
we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is do this in a</font>

259
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:13,449
first phase to have just a way to do

260
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:15,820
manual<font color="#E5E5E5"> key rollovers in a second phase</font>

261
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:19,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">people will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things like how</font>

262
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,860
you'll negotiate a key for one time use

263
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,880
my question I like be set<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ori</font>

264
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,600
using including pre-shared key mode for

265
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,760
I do I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> negotiate a key and</font>

266
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,430
authenticated<font color="#CCCCCC"> get summer session okay if</font>

267
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:38,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">you needed appreciate if you were to use</font>

268
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:40,979
pre-shared key mode for right you'd need

269
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,240
something like this to roll over the

270
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,740
pre-shared key in the first place

271
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,520
because there are many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people with</font>

272
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,520
access to the router

273
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,250
that

274
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,620
this is a large topic that's probably

275
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,820
about to brew on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sack mailing list</font>

276
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">there was some activity on that this</font>

277
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,240
weekend

278
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,630
is there

279
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,459
I think you made the right choices and

280
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,459
thank you thanks

281
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,360
very green Francisco the answer Steve's

282
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,630
question and maybe or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Randy's</font>

283
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,870
question why is this a little bit more

284
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:27,520
complicated it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the being</font>

285
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,560
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have multiple keys and rolling</font>

286
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,180
over I mean you know we've had NB<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 out</font>

287
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">there for years and we kind of some of</font>

288
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:36,279
you guys both networks out there we've

289
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:38,560
had their keys the same key for like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

290
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,480
years because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't change them out</font>

291
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,899
without dropping off sessions so I think

292
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:47,790
the one of the dominant themes is to

293
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:50,560
have a way where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have in OC 768</font>

294
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:54,610
sessions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a hitless rollover</font>

295
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,439
about the key which I didn't allow that

296
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:58,089
I mean looking into it we couldn't find

297
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,990
a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we can get that done on the</font>

298
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:03,490
bike so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be from IETF</font>

299
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,990
because this originally started with the

300
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,120
question business going to begin to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

301
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,770
IETF think the question is this isn't

302
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,080
the way that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been thinking</font>

303
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">about doing IETF this is very much an</font>

304
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,190
operational<font color="#E5E5E5"> operator giving sort of</font>

305
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,930
requirement which is having<font color="#E5E5E5"> that fit</font>

306
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,930
let's roll<font color="#CCCCCC"> over of the key</font>

307
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:27,000
thanks

308
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:29,070
jaron watch itt America<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jerry hi so I'm</font>

309
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,459
just gonna ask my question in public you

310
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:36,690
you already<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it so how do I go in</font>

311
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:39,149
take my internal ibgp session and roll

312
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,940
the key from existing md5 infrastructure

313
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:47,279
to this without making the nanog mailing

314
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:50,070
list<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok we we need a solution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

315
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,370
problem and look forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> to version 5 of</font>

316
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft</font>

317
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:03,340
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bora killed for broadcom the comment</font>

318
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:08,260
about Ike being able to not roll over

319
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:12,460
cheese without without a kit is kind of

320
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:14,980
incorrect if you did I could be one that

321
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:18,940
the ipsec assay is that you would use

322
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:23,530
are not coupled to the I guess I so in

323
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:26,350
fact you can lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> your I kisses have</font>

324
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:28,060
your IP sagesse<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ricky or I can say and</font>

325
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,030
that in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meantime we establish your</font>

326
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:33,640
IP succession so that I this is what I

327
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,140
CLE one I kleeto unfortunately couple

328
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,270
these together but I don't quite

329
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,600
understand in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment while</font>

330
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:42,699
we're so hung up on pre-shared key

331
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,800
because just like you're exchanging Keys

332
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,630
across if you were exchanging

333
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,229
certificates between two service

334
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:53,160
providers or within the same source

335
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:55,990
water which to me is a non-issue then I

336
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,510
should be able to suffice because with

337
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:01,510
Ike every time you do have a new session

338
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:04,150
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> regenerate the keys so maybe I'll</font>

339
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:06,459
participate in the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list and kind</font>

340
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:08,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">of discuss this further there I agree</font>

341
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,180
with Steve's comment here that you're

342
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:12,120
basically doing a lot of the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

343
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,230
I can I protect us all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over again</font>

344
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,819
nothing wrong with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is just that</font>

345
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:20,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe we should try to reuse some of</font>

346
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:20,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

347
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:27,648
<font color="#CCCCCC">perak so here's here's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so in changing</font>

348
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the keys you got to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it this way</font>

349
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:32,570
and a lot of you who run networks and

350
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,730
advantage 75 you know this light so what

351
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,070
you want to prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a Colo meet this</font>

352
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:39,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">column</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meets are a pain in the butt so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

353
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:41,539
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set my key you know here's my</font>

354
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:43,279
new key my okies working here's my new

355
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:45,559
key that's send the email message over

356
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:48,169
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jared and say hey Jared I didn't</font>

357
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:50,450
reset my keys and Jared's not even a

358
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:52,490
look at it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy</font>

359
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,350
meal I'll look at it next week and I

360
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,059
finally look at it and said okay I'm go

361
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:59,029
ahead and set the key here's a new key

362
00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:00,470
and it rolls over and there's no hit and

363
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:03,500
nobody knows about so you got to look at

364
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:05,929
not only how do you roll over keys on

365
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,399
like OC 768<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you can't afford like</font>

366
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:08,960
you know a half a second otherwise the

367
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:10,820
customers see it you're also got to

368
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,070
realize how people operate their

369
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,279
networks and work with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a system</font>

370
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,539
that you know works how they work and

371
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,490
everybody squeeze the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and things</font>

372
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:21,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where some of the</font>

373
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,450
constraints were running running into

374
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:26,090
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and why this is shape out to</font>

375
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:29,360
be different so we encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to</font>

376
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,709
participate I think sag is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF form</font>

377
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,820
where this is being conversed about

378
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,130
right now

379
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,270
there that's a good place to join up at

380
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">least for this time period</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

381
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion</font>

382
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,050
looks like it thank you very much

383
