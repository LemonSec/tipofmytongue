organization clients can do if your

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,689
targeted by one and there's very few

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,619
resources that exist within the

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,060
community or in the government<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can</font>

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,359
help you figure out what to do if you

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">are in fact targeted by a DDoS attack so</font>

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,640
what I hope to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> today is give you an</font>

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,559
idea of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do if you are</font>

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,219
targeted err what you can tell your

15
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,910
clients<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,250
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> properly really defend yourself or</font>

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:51,949
take legal action in the future against

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,950
this is by collecting proper information

19
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:59,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so the United States Secret Service</font>

20
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:04,080
reports that less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0.1 percent of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> du</font>

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,240

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,369
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take into consideration</font>

24
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,890
that this is only the number that is

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,460
might not shock or scare a lot of you

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,669
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there many people tend to think of d</font>

das as a non serious crime that doesn't

<font color="#E5E5E5">really have any victims but it does and</font>

34
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,100
so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run over some of the last</font>

35
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,600
numbers with you just to prove you know

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,490
how this does really hurt company's

37
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,500
first example is one major<font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font>

this is all on US dollars and so you

know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope that these numbers you know</font>

56
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,960
take into account to kind of the

indirect losses from a DDoS attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

58
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:45,170
are things like damage to the brand name

the money spent on bandwidth bills who

60

are the money spent to actually mitigate

the attack just to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">canadian online retailer i just</font>

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,650
mentioned they spent sixteen thousand

mitigation device which ultimately

67
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,630
failed for them they spent over ten

68
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,040
thousand dollars on data center moves

69
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,070
they got kicked out of three different

data centers do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ddos attack because</font>

00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,760
often when these tax come in to data

center they'll knock all the data

73

centers clients offline not just the

74
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,970
client at the targeting they also spent

00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,420
twenty thousand dollars on their

81
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:41,209
mitigating the attack so now the

82
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is what what can you do about</font>

83
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,860
this you know well if this was if

84
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,840
somebody came in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stole this type of</font>

85
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,850
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> from your company or extorted it</font>

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,530
you could easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to your police local</font>

87
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">police station</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tell them and they</font>

88
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,950
would investigate it and arrest those

89
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,299
responsible however if you go to your

90
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,649
local police<font color="#CCCCCC"> and tell them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

91
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,980
under a ddos attack they're going to

92
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,650
have no clue what it is and even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

93
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,910
go to your local FBI field office and

94
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,400
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a division of</font>

95
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybercrime you're not going to get a</font>

96
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">response very fast and when you do get</font>

97
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:13,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">one it's kind of negligible how good</font>

98
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,530
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be and this is because</font>

99
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:18,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">cybercrime is a relatively new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> area for</font>

100
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,910
law enforcement and it's not really

101
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,340
staffed with knowledgeable people who

102
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,200
can investigate these cotton crimes so

103
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is really now how can you</font>

104
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,099
help yourself

105
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,460
and you can help yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> best by</font>

106
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,200
collecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic information that you</font>

107
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">can give to the authorities to help them</font>

108
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,340
and also this information will help you

109
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,550
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to other knowledgeable resources on</font>

110
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,219
the internet and get help so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

111
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,770
thing obviously that you have to do is

112
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,810
get a packet capture and the best source

113
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,940
of course for this packet capture is the

114
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">machine that's on our attack however if</font>

115
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,570
the machines under attack it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

116
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,410
not going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

117
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:59,030
network kind of the fun caveat so what

118
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,800
you hope for then is that you know you

119
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,450
should either have the device on console

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,730
or you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need to get the</font>

121
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:10,670
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> from an upstream device a</font>

122
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:12,830
fibertap<font color="#CCCCCC"> aamir port whatever and you</font>

123
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,260
need to take this site well your teeth

124
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,789
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> dumb you need to remember a couple</font>

125
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,760
important options on this lower case n

126
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:21,080
that's so TCP dump doesn't resolve the

127
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,020
host names and you give yourself

128
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:27,109
secondary DNS flood if you also<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

129
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,820
use dash<font color="#E5E5E5"> lowercase s 0 that's to send</font>

130
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,740
the snap link to catch the entire length

131
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,120
of the packet and this is so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

132
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">look over the payload of the attack a</font>

133
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,730
payload of the packet later and you also

134
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,830
need to use the dash capital<font color="#CCCCCC"> C option so</font>

135
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:43,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can limit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your dump file your pcap</font>

136
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,630
files 25 megabytes surrender and the

137
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,789
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why you want to make them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

138
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,650
smaller size is so they're easier to

139
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,750
open and like protocol analyzed program

140
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,030
like ethereal or whatever you're using

141
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,550
later if you make them too big it's

142
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:56,989
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be problem and when you first</font>

143
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">fall under attack you want to take about</font>

144
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:03,260
three or four of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these packet captures</font>

145
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:04,400
and about a 15-minute period and for the

147
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,469
taking a small packet capture about

00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:12,049
every three or<font color="#CCCCCC"> four hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is so</font>

149
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,940
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a nice bod view of the</font>

154
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,600
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to determine the</font>

type of the attack which is something i

162
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do is obtained a complete</font>

obviously and to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this you're going to</font>

168
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,310
want to just generate like a larger

probably tcp down plain text file then

170
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,990
you can use awk or whatever other

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,670
scripting fancy thing you want to to get

all visual material related to this to

184
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,270
as simple as like a chat log from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

the forehand either by email or

loss figures like how much this attack

197
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,810
is costing you for downtime either per

is critical is that at least in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US I</font>

know it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little different in the UK</font>

00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,580
over five thousand dollars at least for

going to necessarily know what you're

303
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,550
talking about so it might take<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a</font>

304
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:17,480
while to work your way to an engineer

who's actually willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you once</font>

306
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,720
you've actually found it an engineer who

307
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,189
does understand what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

308
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,660
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and who is willing to help you you</font>

309
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,990
obviously want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you know really</font>

310
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,819
nice to them and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information you're</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to get off the infected</font>

currently logged in web blogs access

314
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,240

315
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,270
this information is really dependent on

316
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,250
the hosting facilities policy and the

317
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,140
owner of the machine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting this</font>

318
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,750
information isn't necessarily critical

319
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,970
that your goal here is to actually find

320
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,500
the source code so your key thing is

321
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,480
just to provide help and support to

322
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,690
whatever engineer you're working with to

323
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">find that source code on the machine</font>

324
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:03,380
this process can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere from</font>

325
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:05,990
hours to weeks literally and even at

00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">Prolexic when we have a huge contact</font>

327
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:10,370
list established just for this purpose

328
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:13,340
and sometimes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still difficult even</font>

329
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:15,680
for us to do it so obviously once you

330
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:16,250
actually get the source code the bonnet

331
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,599
source code

332
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:21,980
you want to save this oh and one of the

333
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,650
things i forgot to mention earlier

334
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,950
that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very critical is you really</font>

335
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:30,709
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to save all of your information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

336
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,870
a central location in the early days of

00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:35,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">Prolexic we didn't have a central</font>

339
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:41,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we collected and as a side effect</font>

340
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,740
of that some of the early data on the

341
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,810
first attacks we got is lost and we can

342
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever get it back so don't make that same</font>

343
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:49,310
mistake everything you get put it in a

344
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,960
central spot and keep it there because

345
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,760
especially under stressful situation

346
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,640
things get lost you'll never<font color="#E5E5E5"> find him</font>

347
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:58,330
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now that you have the</font>

348
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,949
source code you're going to want to

349
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,810
examine the source code obviously

350
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:05,300
scripts are the easiest look at them<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

351
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:09,050
know what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on however most bot</font>

352
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,579
code is compiled code and so it's not

353
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:15,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that easy so you're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

354
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:17,000
unpack the exe run strings on it usually

355
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,400
what you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad is a lot of gibberish</font>

356
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,910
okay like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what does this mean you look</font>

357
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,230
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in context do DIA impact exe you</font>

358
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,600
go through what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for is</font>

359
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,160
any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of identifying markers list</font>

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">bars who wrote the code a lot of times</font>

361
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,270
people will put their nicknames in there

362
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:35,209
they'll put group names sometimes leave

363
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:37,490
their real name you never know what

364
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:39,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're automatically looking for is the</font>

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:42,980
IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and the port of the</font>

366
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,050
commanding the control server usually it

367
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,050
will be in there in<font color="#E5E5E5"> plain text so you</font>

368
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:50,390
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that out the worst case</font>

369
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:52,880
scenario is that you can't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

370
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:55,250
information that you understand yet and

371
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,290
the reason why I say yet is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot</font>

372
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,240
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this information depends on context</font>

373
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,770
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because you can't put it in</font>

374
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,630
the proper context right now doesn't

375
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,650
mean you won't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to later I won't</font>

376
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to with some other piece of</font>

377
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:07,699
information that you get so once you've

378
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,960
actually looked at the source<font color="#CCCCCC"> code you</font>

379
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to write yourself kind of a nice</font>

380
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,140
little summary pick out all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key</font>

381
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,579
information and then you're going to

382
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:18,500
want to save that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a central location</font>

383
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:20,780
along with the source code itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

384
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,490
so now that you actually have the IP

385
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,530
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and port hopefully of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">controlling server you either got this</font>

387
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,720
from the source code or you can also get

388
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">it from</font>

389
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,660
the connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> table of one of the</font>

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:35,100
attacking you and what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

392
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,360
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is verify this so that means</font>

393
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,699
you're either going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell that to the</font>

394
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,569
IP port combination or connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> with an</font>

IRC client to the command<font color="#E5E5E5"> and control</font>

396
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:49,439
server and I'm assuming<font color="#CCCCCC"> that most of you</font>

397
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:51,859
know what an IRC you know server answers

398
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:55,259
like so you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to recognize it</font>

399
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:57,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">now the process for cotton for getting</font>

this I receiver IRC server shutdown is

401
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:03,329
very similar to the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

402

took to locate order to get your the

get warrants to get machine set shut

down and and seized but you know you

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick</font>

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very patient now I've mentioned</font>

427
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,769
kind of several times that abuse

428
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,920
contacts are difficult to deal with

429
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:04,349
especially when it comes to DDoS you

430
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,730
know slow process people are very

431
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,770
reluctant to believe what you have to

432
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,510
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this raises a really</font>

433
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,819
good question of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve</font>

434
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,129
awareness of this in the community and

435
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,079
how to get legitimate requests answered

436
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,510
in a timely fashion or forwarded<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

437
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,908
someone who knows and can answer them I

438
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:23,480
don't have a good answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just</font>

00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:28,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">throwing this out there is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

440
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:31,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay all right so for this next part</font>

441
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:33,990
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually finding the attack or</font>

442
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">the person who is responsible for maybe</font>

443
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,950
writing the code or at least launching

444
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,800
the attack against you and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where</font>

445
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,740
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to issue a big huge</font>

446
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,240
disclaimer if you don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're</font>

447
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,060
doing if you don't know how to hide your

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">identity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well your location well don't</font>

449
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:52,370
attempt this most attackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> or angry ex</font>

450
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:54,080
employees they could be possibly

451
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:56,090
affiliated with organized crime unless

452
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,100
you really know how to hide who you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

453
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,379
don't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> after them they find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out who</font>

454
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are you're just as likely you're</font>

455
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,330
totally likely to have them turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> on you</font>

456
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:07,340
and that won't be pleasant thing so

457
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,960
first thing you want to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

458
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,179
review all the information you have so

459
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">far you know kind of maybe get a feel</font>

460
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:17,090
for who this person is so then you need

461
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:19,010
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact the attacker and you usually</font>

462
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:22,040
do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the IRC server that he's</font>

463
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:25,280
already sitting on any<font color="#CCCCCC"> information that</font>

464
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get out of him you obviously want to</font>

465
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,830
save and log all these conversations

466
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,610
because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be very useful</font>

467
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:34,280
for later there's a big caveat here

468
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,020
though and that's that any conversations

469
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,960
that occur on a private IRC server

470
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,580
aren't admissible in court usually

471
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,010
that's why these conversations occur on

472
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,860
a public IRC server it's much for the

473
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,000
better it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really horrible</font>

474
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,800
to get to a point where you actually

475
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,450
have somebody that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going to</font>

476
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,399
persecute for one of these attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

477
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:55,700
your key evidence is something that

478
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,870
can't even be<font color="#CCCCCC"> used so public servers</font>

479
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:01,910
good private<font color="#CCCCCC"> servers bad hopefully the</font>

480
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,260
information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attacker gives to</font>

481
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,960
you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you piece together the</font>

482
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,820
attack from a high level and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of put</font>

483
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,710
together you know what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what</font>

484
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,659
his motivations are perhaps where he is

485
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,820
in the world however this really isn't

486
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,800
very easy most attackers are highly

487
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,689
motivated<font color="#CCCCCC"> and highly skilled individuals</font>

488
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:21,560
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually a matter of waiting for</font>

489
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:23,390
them to slip up<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I've been</font>

00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,860
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time resources</font>

491
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can go to either with law</font>

492
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,149
enforcement or resources in the

493
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,969
community here are the resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i</font>

494

am referring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your local FBI field</font>

495
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:36,230

haven't worked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them much so I can't</font>

00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,150
give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> my input I just know that they</font>

502

do handle cases like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> cert you can</font>

certainly send your information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them</font>

I've

guys that come we are absolutely great

will<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely help you they will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

know if they have it even within their

power they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you to mitigate</font>

a cybercrime division and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

515
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's now been changed to where</font>

516
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:21,750
cybercrime actually resides in the local

517
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,160
field offices like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does with FBI one</font>

518
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,770
of the resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I find most</font>

519
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,330
helpful is loco<font color="#E5E5E5"> US Secret Service</font>

520
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,790
there's some my favorite to work with on

521
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:32,520
this they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a division of electronic</font>

522
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:34,200
crimes and yes your local US Secret

00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,830
Service<font color="#E5E5E5"> Service office does have this</font>

524
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,720
and then a new resource that engineers

525
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:43,110
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prolexic are working at putting</font>

526
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:46,140
together is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ddos DB org and what's going</font>

527
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:47,909
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be on there is how to identify or</font>

528
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,250
recognize you know different types of

529
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:53,700
attacks you know basic descriptions what

530
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:55,440
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> d das all my notes and this</font>

531
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,260
presentation from today will be on there

532
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,360
and hopefully soon will either get to

533
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,990
release part or all of our internal

534
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,820
attack database to the public and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

535
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:08,130
hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this will encourage other</font>

536
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,689
people to put their attack information

537
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:13,530
there so we can kind of build a way to

538
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:15,090
like identify our profile botnets and

539
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:18,050
hopefully it will become a central

540
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:20,520
repository for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of information</font>

541
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:22,800
all right now to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of go through how</font>

542
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,900
this whole data collection forensic

543
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,690
process works I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through two</font>

544
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,660
case studies with you and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one</font>

545
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:35,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the success story and it involves the</font>

546
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:38,160
tracking of an attack series named x3m

547
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,110
one st or exe he was responsible for

548
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundreds of extortion based DDoS attacks</font>

549
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,969
we documented all the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> on him</font>

550
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:48,030
tracked him for months it eventually led

551
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:50,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to a successful rest here's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

high overview of had a tact function the

553
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:56,100
attacker basically hid behind four

554
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,160
levels of hacked servers to conceal his

555
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,439
identity and the bonnet was comprised of

556
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,010
you know mix of general machines on the

557
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">methods and obviously all malicious</font>

560
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:12,780

562
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,940
actually the tracker on this case and

cross-site scripting vulnerability and

595
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,260
PHP in which you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the query string</font>

596
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:46,679
and you insert it right as an include

doing any validity checking but he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

599
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:53,430
pretty crafty he also used it my SQL

600
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:56,280
injection he used holes in popular

601
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:57,780
control panel cold like cpanel and<font color="#E5E5E5"> holes</font>

602
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,330
in a lot of the popular shopping carts

603
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,940
to recruit machines he also actively

604
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,919
browsed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> O'Day list and she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

adapt his code I mean basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I</font>

606
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:11,490
saw in under an hour for any<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exploit</font>

607
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:13,230
so he was creative blow guy um same it's

608
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,060
the same basic scenario here he<font color="#CCCCCC"> hid</font>

himself behind multiple layers you know

having such powerful buzz having such a

spiked over 10 gigabits per second

616
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:30,810
problem with a flood like this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

617
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,840
it knocked a lot of our upstream

618

about flood for them which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always fun</font>

on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular case I was the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that he had done this actually multiple</font>

632
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,970
unfortunately what happened with this

633
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:18,540
guy was that he eventually disappeared

634
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:20,580
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before that I was able to also get</font>

out of him that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he English was a second</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">university servers and also that he was</font>

00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,590
attacking other sites<font color="#E5E5E5"> about six other</font>

sites that happened to sell the same

product as the client that we were

protecting and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually went to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">were they not surprised but they said it</font>

644
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:43,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">made perfect sense they'd actually been</font>

00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,660
threatened via the phone over phone

several times by competitor trying to

<font color="#E5E5E5">force them out of business so once we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of put all this together oh yeah</font>

649
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that this attack</font>

650
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:56,190
occurred right before<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas and over</font>

651
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,129
Christmas which is the busiest time for

652
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:00,210
any retailer so this kind of goes to put

653
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:04,590
together<font color="#CCCCCC"> the picture that this was</font>

654
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:06,510
corporate sabotage I spoke with abba for

655
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:08,040
weeks he never really gave up anything

656
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,450
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> himself this guy was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably the</font>

657
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,820
one of the most professional I've ever

658
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,110
dealt with which would go with the fact

659
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,770
that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> said that he's been doing this</font>

660
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:18,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">for quite a while it became really</font>

661
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,970
difficult to obtain further information

662
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,390
because he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was always logged in from</font>

663
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:25,620
either China or Japan those countries

664
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,290
can be a bit difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with</font>

665
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,659
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> China</font>

666
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,490
and so the end result was that I turned

667
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:36,030
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the information to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the FBI and</font>

668
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:37,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">let them pursue the case further so</font>

669
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:41,190
everything that I brought up today I

670
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:43,410
think leaves us some big kind of issues

671
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:45,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">to address in the community and that's</font>

672
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:49,020
better abuse contacts maybe one

673
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,810
specifically for d das we also don't

674
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,610
have any centralized repository

675
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:55,919
specifically for ddos profiling like we

676
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:57,990
do for worms and viruses<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I'm</font>

677
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,810
hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doobie org my head in</font>

678
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:02,570
this direction I don't know I realize

679
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:05,580
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this information gathering is</font>

680
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:07,620
extremely intensive but it's very worth

00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:11,280
it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only to you but to</font>

00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:22,139
to be cleaned up a little bit the shoe

the others that everybody out there and

<font color="#E5E5E5">and you're trying to debug these things</font>

708
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:28,100
well said hi Mike use links<font color="#E5E5E5"> um comment</font>

709
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,320
about the nht see you and what's

710
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,519
happened to the nht see you and that

711
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,470
they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> rolled up into an</font>

712
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:37,120
organization called the Serious

713
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:40,009
Organised Crime Agency or soccer and

714
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,840
there's a genuine concern in the UK and

715
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:43,460
the nht see you have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> really helpful</font>

716
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,529
in the past but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a genuine</font>

717
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,450
concern that some of the e crime stuff

718
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:49,340
is going to fall down the gap because

719
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:52,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's like well level one sort of petty</font>

720
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:54,080
crime go to your local<font color="#E5E5E5"> plod soccer is</font>

721
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,149
far more interested in sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of level 3</font>

722
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,720
organized crime drug rackets and things

723
00:28:56,149 --> 00:29:02,539
like that and sort of extortion and

724
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,549
hacking and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andy dose is like kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

725
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:06,649
well it's not as bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the drug guys so</font>

726
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:08,179
it falls down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gap is a second-rate</font>

727
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:10,699
thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and there's a genuine</font>

728
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:12,139
concern about that so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

729
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,210
case of watch this space with that

730
00:29:12,139 --> 00:29:17,120
because I certainly the nht see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

731
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:18,740
approachable and and then had a lot of

732
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,229
Industry outreach where is sort of

733
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:23,419
soccer a far more sort of arms reach

734
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:28,639
dark and shady types you know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

735
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:31,220
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that about law enforcement okay hi</font>

736
00:29:28,639 --> 00:29:32,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bill Woodcock um I wonder if you could</font>

737
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:35,149
spend a little bit more time on the

738
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:37,820
issue of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the public versus private IRC</font>

739
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:39,529
servers and what obviously we know the

740
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,330
technical distinction but what the legal

741
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:44,299
distinction is between public and

742
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:46,970
private there and why conversations that

743
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:48,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">you yourself are involved in are not</font>

744
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:49,890
admissible if that's what you were

745
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:52,949
saying yes

746
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:55,470
ok so the distinction<font color="#E5E5E5"> between public and</font>

747
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:58,680
private IRC server right a private IRC

748
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:00,750
server is any IRC server that's run by a

749
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,790
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> or individual that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not publicly</font>

750
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,500
accessible that's restricted only to

751
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:07,740
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure why this definition</font>

752
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,990
exists but it does private IRC server is

753
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,900
also if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on a hacked machine</font>

754
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:15,330
that's a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRC server it's a box</font>

755
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">owned by somebody else I'm not exactly</font>

756
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:20,639
sure why technically according to the

757
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:22,170
law<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed this is what you</font>

758
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,910
know I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been told by the FBI and I've</font>

759
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,380
also experienced this fact that some of

760
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:27,960
my stuff won't be admitted into

761
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,180
investigations because of this a public

762
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:34,380
IRC servers basically defined as an IRC

763
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:37,830
server who anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> can connect to and so</font>

764
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:39,900
that's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> f net doll net you know</font>

765
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:41,879
any publicly accessible one those

766
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:45,050
conversations are perfectly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i'm not</font>

767
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:47,580
sure why the ones on a private like

768
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:49,950
private box are or aren't but i just

769
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,449
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> app to david</font>

771
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:55,230
conversation is admissible though I'm

772
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,240
sorry could you repeat that what you

773
00:30:55,230 --> 00:31:01,110
assert about the contents of the

774
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:04,320
conversation is admissible go mmm the

775
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:06,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">cop I mean you can whatever you get from</font>

776
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,220
it you could admit but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's only hearsay</font>

777
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:10,350
you can't since you can't admit<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

778
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,490
actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation it's not fact it's</font>

779
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,620
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if you learned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

780
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:16,290
from it it's here saying can I mean it

781
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:20,929
can definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you but it's just</font>

782
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:24,270
not actually admissible in a court right

783
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:27,300
Anton capella<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 9's data I just have a</font>

785
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,830
recommend when customers are attempting

786
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:34,800
a bit of the forensics you talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

787
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:37,320
earlier when it's likely that the tools

788
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,419
you you would use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of figure out</font>

789
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">what happened to the host the tools</font>

790
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:44,490
themselves could be back door door

791
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:47,130
exchanged for ones which hide the fact

792
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,840
that anything happened how does proxy

793
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:51,540
how do you recommend customers deal with

794
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,220
that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff I guess they don't</font>

795
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:56,010
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> your butt well first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that way said</font>

796
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:58,080
nuts that output and that kind of stuff

797
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:01,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I've found that many machines we've</font>

798
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,580
dealt with are very well rooted if you

799
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,740
will

800
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,678
and they'd even change that's that or

801
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,210
the output of such oh you mean like if

802
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,919
somebody's actually rooted the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine</font>

803
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:14,460
in there I'm changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data on it</font>

804
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:15,809
absolutely okay um well in that case I

805
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,789
guess I'm just hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoever</font>

806
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:19,799
you're working with can kind of help you

807
00:32:17,789 --> 00:32:22,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">to determine to if the machine has been</font>

808
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:23,730
rooted like that sure I mean if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're I</font>

809
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:25,350
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> chances are gonna be dealing with</font>

810
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:28,140
you know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you i'm gonna be</font>

811
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:30,000
dealing with you and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

812
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,500
mean if we start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that box and</font>

813
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,120
you know between the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us we ought</font>

814
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,909
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be figured out if it's been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> routed</font>

815
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,559
sure is i'm thinking for like likes a

816
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:40,080
colocation customer people<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

817
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:42,539
access to directly is there is there any

818
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:45,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of network level stuff I'm trying</font>

819
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:46,889
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with or doing yeah not I</font>

820
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,860
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really that's where you know</font>

821
00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:51,449
like colocation clients and boxes you

822
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,129
don't have access to that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

823
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,690
gets tricky I mean you you know your

824
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,880
information is only as good as the

825
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:59,549
source you're getting it from so sure

826

miscibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> has evidence about</font>

834
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,158
conversations on some public servers

835
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:29,789
what if the server is located outside of

840
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:40,768
and how about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a private conversation</font>

841
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,380
instead of some public conversation on

842
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:44,490
some channel for something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>
