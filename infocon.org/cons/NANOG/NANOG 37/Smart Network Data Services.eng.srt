<font color="#E5E5E5">alright good morning and my name is Ella</font>

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,829
Gilliam and I'm here to talk about smart

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,750
network data services so what I'm going

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about is first a little bit</font>

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,948
about postmaster which I'll get into in

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,210
a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then dive into smds and</font>

7
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:23,220
what's the more time to address with

8
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">this system the goal about you know how</font>

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,250
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to achieve it what it does today</font>

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,979
what it's going to be doing soon why I

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,780
hope you'll use it some feedback I want

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,980
to get on it and hopefully we'll have

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,750
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some questions so postmaster is</font>

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,309
kind of the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> starting point for any</font>

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have related to send email</font>

16
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,230
into hotmail or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows Live it's got</font>

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,500
information on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> programs we</font>

18
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,910
have stuff like sender ID you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can find</font>

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,269
out information there about how to adopt

20
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">why to adopt that sort of stuff we've</font>

21
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,620
got a program for any of you that are

22
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,890
familiar with a Wells comp feed it's

23
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,860
called a junk mail reporting program and

24
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:07,200
it gives you the message bodies of the

25
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,020
males that are our users hit the this is

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,930
junk button for mail that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,590
that's that can be pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful for for</font>

28
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:20,250
understanding any bad stuff in your in

29
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,170
your ISP mail server for instance it's

30
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,390
got a information and a pointer to the

31
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,280
snds site which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a second</font>

32
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,530
and I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some support information</font>

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,810
some some information that hopefully

34
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,880
helps you deal with problems yourself

35
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:38,700
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't you tells you how to</font>

36
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:41,280
contact us so that we can help you so

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,500
smart<font color="#E5E5E5"> network data services besides</font>

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">being a mouthful it's obviously a</font>

39
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,850
website and I in fact encourage you to

40
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,890
to go to the website and check it out

41
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,419
while I'm talking I bet many of you

42
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,520
could be viewing some really interesting

43
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,509
data about your networks by the time I'm

44
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,399
done speaking so the problem is

45
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,280
basically stuff we're all already

46
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,920
familiar with and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact is it makes</font>

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,750
customers unhappy today you know when i

48
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,660
berate people for not having broadband

49
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,129
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not irregular for me to hear</font>

50
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,569
well why should I pay more for the bad

51
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,260
stuff to<font color="#CCCCCC"> reach my computer that much</font>

52
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,030
faster

53
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,239
it's it's clearly a tangible problem for

54
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,250
the industry so what do we do we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

55
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,780
stop it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the way we try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do that</font>

56
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now is is sort of last minute</font>

57
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,640
before it hits<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user we try and jump</font>

58
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,620
in there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> grab it and the fact is</font>

59
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,579
that works it makes image dent in the

60
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">prog the problem and we learn some stuff</font>

61
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:41,830
but the fact is it's not really solving

62
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:43,480
the problem so another solution is to to

63
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,209
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that what we're learning</font>

64
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,750
and go and apply it in a place that it

65
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:52,209
has more more value<font color="#E5E5E5"> / for work input and</font>

66
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,790
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is that this has the</font>

67
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:56,580
potential to actually start solving the

68
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,829
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just mitigating it</font>

69
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,410
now there's people doing this today but

70
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,670
the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there's not very many and so</font>

71
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,170
that's what sort of what I'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

72
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,970
address is try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get people shifted</font>

73
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:12,579
from from mode number one into mode

74
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:15,310
number two one of the ways i'd like to

75
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:18,280
appeal to to the idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this is</font>

76
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,840
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stop it at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last minute</font>

77
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,070
approach means it's coming from

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,310
everywhere and you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure it</font>

79
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,900
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stop at all all those places the</font>

80
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,660
total number of problems in this system

81
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,299
if you will is order N squared whereas

82
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you if you decide to keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself</font>

83
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:36,010
clean then theoretically most what you

84
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,110
have to work on is keeping yourself

85
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,149
clean and you only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one problem and</font>

86
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,600
then the total system is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually much</font>

87
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,799
more efficient it's solving the problems

88
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,560
you've actually reduced the work in the

89
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,200
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> for any flowchart nerds out there</font>

90
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,480
you might notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the the the shape</font>

91
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,820
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the left is the bars on the other</font>

92
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,679
side is the predefined process meaning

93
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,390
that that's that's what that's what will

94
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do the thing on the</font>

95
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,470
right which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the decision symbol to</font>

96
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:06,970
actually be proactive and address the

97
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:09,310
problem directly but so we're not where

98
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:13,239
we are today but by<font color="#CCCCCC"> accident the the</font>

99
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:15,820
fact is that today people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ISPs are</font>

100
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,918
measured and<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive business results by</font>

101
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,810
how much bad stuff they receive and

102
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,909
their customers are are impacted with

103
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,700
not according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what they send out</font>

104
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,140
themselves if you bear with me I think

105
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's an analogy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the health care</font>

106
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,169
industry

107
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,090
where customers by service from an

108
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,289
insurance agency and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have much</font>

109
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,030
perspective and there's no business

110
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,410
motivation according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to how that</font>

111
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,849
insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> agents</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tree works with the</font>

112
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,889
doctors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the medical</font>

113
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,169
ecosystem and I think there's a similar

114
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:43,690
disconnect between users buying service

115
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:46,719
from an ISP and how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is P behaves in</font>

116
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,760
the ecosystem most of the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

117
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,220
stuff on the slide is hopefully stuff

118
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,070
that that people are familiar with just

119
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,770
repeating it for the for the sake of of

120
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:58,419
driving the points home I guess but the

121
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:01,690
the I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's worth asking the</font>

122
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:03,250
question of what do we have to do to

123
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,370
persuade folks to deal with this problem

124
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:12,160
directly is not as a rhetorical question

125
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:14,139
but what literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we do so when I</font>

126
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,610
was producing these slides I it sort of

127
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:18,430
occurred to me that I felt like I was

128
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:22,330
putting together 12-step program so i

129
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:24,970
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the 12-step website and sort of</font>

130
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:27,370
made my own little seven step program as

131
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,139
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows the the first step is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

132
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,070
admit you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a problem and so</font>

133
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:32,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">hopefully what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to tell you</font>

134
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:35,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">about today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to help you do that</font>

135
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,030
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next step is to believe that</font>

136
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,520
someone can help and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm here to do that</font>

137
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,109
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> I when attending the security</font>

138
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:46,000
buff yesterday I found some interesting

139
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:48,010
stuff results<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a survey where it was</font>

140
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,840
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like two-thirds of the nsp set</font>

141
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,240
community felt that they were in a

142
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,669
position to solve this problem I thought

143
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was particularly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inspiring to some</font>

144
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:59,380
degree although<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's also so why isn't</font>

145
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:03,280
two-thirds of the community solving<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

146
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:05,260
problem so the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step in that in the</font>

147
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,698
program is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to decide to do something and</font>

148
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,760
hopefully that's something you'll all do

149
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,740
today the next two steps are basically

150
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,490
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool to go find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out where the</font>

151
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,310
problems are<font color="#CCCCCC"> and go fix them step 10 is</font>

152
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a rinse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and repeat if you will and</font>

153
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:22,539
and the last one is is because i have no

154
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,370
marketing budget tell other people about

155
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:27,070
it tell them tell people that this thing

156
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,389
exists what this crazy idea is you know

157
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,909
how it works for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all that sort of</font>

158
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:35,440
stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people can find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

159
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:37,990
it and use it so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this smds thing</font>

160
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,390
anyway it's it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> website that offers</font>

161
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,160
free and instant access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

162
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:43,840
of some really interesting data that we

163
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">have what we see coming from your IP</font>

164
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,799
space this data is designed to to inform

165
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:53,560
about problems related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these bad</font>

166
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,260
stuff we see on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet the system</font>

167
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,970
is is its purpose is to give data to

168
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,830
isps so that they can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own</font>

169
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:03,700
decisions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what activity is</font>

170
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:06,340
acceptable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not and deal with it as</font>

171
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,450
they see fit the idea idea being that a

172
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,590
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will make good decisions</font>

173
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:13,840
to stop bad behavior one of the

174
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,460
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspects of the system is the</font>

175
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,320
automated mechanism we have to grant

176
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,539
access to the data you come to the site

177
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,590
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> request</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access for an IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right and</font>

178
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:25,690
we can tell you who you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

179
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,630
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that get that software</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right right</font>

180
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,670
you know instantly and automatically and

181
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:33,520
that this authorization mechanism

182
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:35,110
actually authorizes people we don't care

183
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">what company you're from or what subnets</font>

184
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,330
you want to aggregate together under one

185
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:41,800
account it it's this isn't something the

186
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:43,330
company buys into it's something that

187
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,360
the guy who works at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the abuse desk or</font>

188
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,789
an IP allocation any email addresses

189
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,700
that show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your who is records for</font>

190
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,590
instance they can just do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on their</font>

191
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,690
lunch hour just go to the website sign

192
00:07:53,590 --> 00:08:00,549
up look at some data and hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn</font>

193
00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:01,770
some stuff but so lastly it's it's it's

194
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,630
my attempt at a force multiplier

195
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,669
basically what this the system is is is

196
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,409
data we already have data we produced as

197
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,570
part of our anti-spam operations and

198
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:16,930
we're trying to leverage this data to do

199
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:18,820
more good than it does currently so the

200
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,320
goals hopefully they're pretty clear

201
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,599
hopefully they're answering this is

202
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,930
answering<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem statement from</font>

203
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:28,180
before is to provide information<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow</font>

204
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:30,670
ISPs to detect and deal with any

205
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,280
undesired activity we want to provide a

206
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:36,070
broad set of data<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> useful for</font>

207
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that purpose based off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what we see</font>

208
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,540
which is hopefully a pretty good sample

209
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:43,240
of what happens to the Internet in

210
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:46,839
general one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the core tenants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

211
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">system is is is being free that no ISP</font>

212
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,830
should be without this this tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font>

213
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,510
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of visibility you shouldn't</font>

214
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to buy crazy infrastructure in your</font>

215
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,889
network to

216
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,170
if packets and extrapolate what's

217
00:08:54,889 --> 00:08:59,389
happening fact is I have the data you

218
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:02,439
know let's take you make use of it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

219
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:05,959
very it's very useful data that respect

220
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,759
so the other thing we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on</font>

221
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:10,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">is bringing sort of what I call the the</font>

222
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:12,259
total cost of remediation down to its

223
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,600
absolute minimum we all know this is

224
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:16,160
about business cases and so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

225
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,230
being if I can reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost as much</font>

226
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">as possible then the bar for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

227
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,399
benefit for convincing people that it's

228
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:24,380
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do good get slower according to</font>

229
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,750
how much lower the cost is so hopefully

230
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,060
by by giving the data for free hopefully

231
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,730
the the cost for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspect goes to</font>

232
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,888
almost zero and I'm interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

233
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">other aspects of the of the of the</font>

234
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:40,339
solution that<font color="#E5E5E5"> enable the the total cost</font>

235
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,870
to be as low as possible basically it's

236
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:43,220
a standard story for Microsoft we just

237
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:48,649
want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet a better place</font>

238
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:52,100
and solve world hunger and such so who

239
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:54,880
are we to be giving data well how<font color="#CCCCCC"> melz</font>

240
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:58,220
big and we have 240 million accounts and

241
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,610
220 countries and territories we get

242
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,230
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 billion emails every day one of</font>

243
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,490
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to say is in the time</font>

244
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,029
it takes me to say this will have

245
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,649
accepted a hundred thousand messages

246
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:13,310
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a pretty big infrastructure</font>

247
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:15,139
we get a ton of data and we have really

248
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,689
interesting systems that detect a lot of

249
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:19,670
that is spam and stop it for the user we

250
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:22,160
get reports from the user about spam and

251
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,079
fraud we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding phishing sites we're</font>

252
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,910
finding malware sites were finding

253
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,310
stopping viruses we're getting data from

254
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:32,449
the rest of Microsoft we've got we've

255
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:35,388
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> tons of data at hotmail just as an</font>

256
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:37,099
illustration this is a just an overview

257
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:38,209
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system are in by mail system to</font>

258
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,160
show you all the complexity of the

259
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:42,219
systems we build and we're all this data

260
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,600
comes from and why we can afford<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just</font>

261
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,470
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you data on the side because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

262
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:51,050
other systems were building so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

263
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,490
kind of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> heart of snds and I</font>

264
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,399
realize you probably can't see very well

265
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,540
in the on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the monitors but if</font>

266
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,589
you're following along<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the slides</font>

267
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:03,279
locally you'll be able to see there and

268
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:06,079
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try and work you through it</font>

269
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,430
basically the once you've authorized to

270
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,719
view some data

271
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:12,930
you click the view data in the upper

272
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,760
left and day<font color="#CCCCCC"> by day you can see the</font>

273
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:18,030
aggregated traffic summary for your

274
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:21,050
network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you can see the the left</font>

275
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:23,160
column leftmost column is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP address</font>

276
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:25,530
that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you data about</font>

277
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,949
the next one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the the hours during</font>

278
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:30,720
which it was transmitting mail the next

279
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">three columns come from come from best</font>

280
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">SMTP when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many recipients</font>

281
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,640
and data commands at that IP sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

282
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,280
and then the message recipients is the

283
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,630
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of actual recipients on the data</font>

284
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,420
segments that they transmitted to us

285
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:47,550
that can be distinct from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> recipient</font>

286
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:51,479
some pretty interesting ways but then

287
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,740
besides<font color="#E5E5E5"> general traffic stats we give</font>

288
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,920
some pretty good qualitative information

289
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,630
we have spam filters and we tell you the

290
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,360
aggregate result of filtering this ip's

291
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:05,610
traffic and in terms of a red yellow

292
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,260
green status we also tell you the rate

293
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,990
at which users presley this is junk

294
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:11,939
button on that mail we have a pretty

295
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:14,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool trap mail system so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have traffic</font>

296
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,560
counts and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll tell you when that IP</font>

297
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:20,190
hit hit our traffic counts and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

298
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,290
they did that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool for</font>

299
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,390
giving you high resolution<font color="#CCCCCC"> timestamps so</font>

300
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,099
you can go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your DHCP logs and and</font>

301
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:29,910
figure out exactly what customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

302
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,980
was another way we provide broad data is

303
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,990
giving you sample hello and mail from

304
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,180
commands so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually get an idea</font>

305
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,650
of of what the the traffic looks like

306
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,620
what what the mail that's being sent

307
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:41,939
looks like and lastly we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

308
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,280
comments column which is sort of our

309
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,890
catch-all for anything else we might

310
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,930
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you currently that the only</font>

311
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,790
thing this displays is when we find an

312
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,589
open proxy will tell you that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found</font>

313
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:56,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">an open proxy at what time we tested it</font>

314
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:58,860
positive another thing you you see on

315
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:01,410
this screen is there's an export to CSV

316
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,750
button which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are our poor man's</font>

317
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,329
solution for being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to consume this</font>

318
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:08,550
data if you have systems that can you

319
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:11,310
can feed data in about customers and it

320
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:14,099
takes action the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> be is that you can</font>

321
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:15,750
export the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and feed that in to</font>

322
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">start to use this data in that fashion</font>

323
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,200
as well

324
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:22,910
so what we think we can accomplish today

325
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:25,129
is basically show you the magnitude of

326
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:27,139
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and give you you know the</font>

327
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:29,389
evidence to back it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see exactly</font>

328
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:33,980
where it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and hopefully what this does</font>

329
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:35,540
is provide firepower to to go get

330
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,610
additional resources on the problem

331
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,680
maybe that's someone in the abuse desk

332
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,689
to to be calling someone you know

333
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,969
calling customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight hours a day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

334
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:45,199
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get them cleaned up or maybe</font>

335
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,449
it's you know additional monitoring

336
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,229
infrastructure to put into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

337
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:52,748
to to get a different view we get some

338
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty good feedback from our users and</font>

339
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:58,399
some of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things they're doing</font>

340
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,959
is stopping spam by doing port 25

341
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,149
blocking both in the in the classic

342
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:05,689
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know blocking it for an</font>

343
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:07,850
entire subnet but also using this data

344
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:10,009
reactively and saying well this customer

345
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,290
is sending bad mail so I'll block it

346
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:13,610
I'll put in a port 25 block on him that

347
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:17,480
follows him around no<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter where he</font>

348
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:19,399
goes in my network some people actually

349
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">go for even further though and they go</font>

350
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,329
and contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer and they help</font>

351
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,769
them get cleaned and hopefully they

352
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:27,069
motivate them not to get compromised

353
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:27,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">again</font>

354
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:36,459
so the system today has about

355
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:39,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty-five hundred users most of these</font>

356
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,599
users are what I call<font color="#E5E5E5"> senders they these</font>

357
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:42,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">are people who know they're sending mail</font>

358
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,889
and are often interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the the</font>

359
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,369
deliverability statistics that we

360
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:51,610
provide there's definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a significant</font>

361
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:54,249
minority of users which I call ISPs who

362
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:55,689
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're sending</font>

363
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:57,850
some mail<font color="#E5E5E5"> for through their mail servers</font>

364
00:14:55,689 --> 00:15:00,248
but in reality have a much larger IP

365
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,170
space where they're using this the

366
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:04,990
system to find out what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening in</font>

367
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,759
the rest of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP space we do</font>

368
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,429
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> have 67 million I peas that</font>

369
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:11,009
are authorized to view data for I think

370
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:14,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a pretty interesting number and</font>

371
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:15,910
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> those 67 million IPS they account</font>

372
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,800
for about ten or<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty percent of the</font>

373
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:20,949
environmental valium and the complaints

374
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,219
with that we receive every day but my

375
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:25,599
favorite statistic I think is that

376
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:28,600
statistically speaking on a subnet on

377
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,089
this last<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24 a bigger when it starts</font>

378
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,649
being monitored by the system we see the

379
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:35,949
the aggregate mail output from that

380
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:37,389
subnet drop by over half and no matter

381
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:43,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">how you explain that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's pretty</font>

382
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:44,769
compelling so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on a new</font>

383
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,899
release<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this system where we're going</font>

384
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:48,069
to do even more<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the things</font>

385
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:49,809
we're going to do is to allow you to

386
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:51,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">sign up using your autonomous system</font>

387
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:54,309
number instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to enter each</font>

388
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,600
of your subnets manually we're also

389
00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:57,189
going to have better support<font color="#CCCCCC"> for up</font>

390
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,939
between providers to keep an eye on on

391
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:03,670
their downstream customers we're going

392
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:06,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">to provide true programmatic access that</font>

393
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can really hook up systems to be</font>

394
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,649
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> automatic to consume this data</font>

395
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:14,100
and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be providing new data</font>

396
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:16,199
we're expanding from from just<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alan spam</font>

397
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,369
according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our original vision and</font>

398
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,758
going to give data about when we find

pieces a male infected with the virus

400
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:26,170
when we find phishing websites and

401
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:27,399
malware websites using the honey monkey

402
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:30,729
project that you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have heard about</font>

403
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:32,769
in the press about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a year ago we're also</font>

404
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,540
going to give sample messages that that

405
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:38,470
was a pretty strong bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feedback we</font>

406
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:39,790
got from our users that the messages

407
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,649
contain some important forensic

408
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,189
information as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as they're pretty</font>

409
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:46,650
compelling evidence to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

410
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,420
you know have the the evidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

411
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,130
caught red-handed the actual message

412
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,729
instead of just somebody else's log

413
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:55,260
files which said something bad happened

414
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,450
now the asterisks is up there on the top

415
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,530
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> an old adage in the software</font>

416
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,660
industry is don't count your chickens

417
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,920
until they hatch this this hasn't

418
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,589
shipped yet this is just what we're

419
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,359
planning on shipping its best supposed

420
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:07,770
to release in about a month so please

421
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,609
keep us in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back your mind for what</font>

422
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:13,920
for when that does ship so why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

423
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:15,300
doing this release well though we want

424
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,319
to lower the cost we want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

425
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,349
easier for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign up</font>

426
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,409
particularly the bigger eyes peas for

427
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:23,849
that asn<font color="#CCCCCC"> signup mechanism and we want to</font>

428
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">make it with the programmatic access</font>

429
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:27,000
particularly we want to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheaper</font>

430
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,970
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep using the system to leverage</font>

00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,310
that's better support for upstream

00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,510
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this to check on them</font>

445
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,660
first and keep an eye on them to see

<font color="#E5E5E5">what kind of thing he's doing with with</font>

00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:14,820
this the power he's been granted and so

448
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,590
besides as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said just BAM we want to we</font>

449
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,610
want to branch out into directly

addressing some more of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">problems by by telling you about when</font>

452
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,580
emails have viruses in them then we'll

453
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,649
then the machine that sent the that mail

454
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,840
either itself is infected<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the virus</font>

455
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:33,450
or is probably an outbound mail relay

456
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,060
that may be worth investing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

457
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,290
outbound<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a virus scanner to make</font>

458
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,290
sure that the traffic coming out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

459
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:42,030

460
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,430
giving data for the phishing and malware

461
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,379
sites we're hopeful that that they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

462
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,360
more takedowns and and that will happen

463
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,690
faster because the system totally

464
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,689
automatic

465
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,450
so once you go in and you want to work

466
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:58,570
with customers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with this</font>

467
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:00,910

468
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,710
fix their machine and so I sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

469
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,530
just assembled a list off the top of my

470
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:07,960
head<font color="#E5E5E5"> of various tools that are out there</font>

471
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:10,210
that help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do this from malicious</font>

472
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,650
software removal tool which can take I

473
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,120
think it's something like ninety-five

474
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,670
percent of the problems that we see on

475
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,429
on consumer machines and can can

476
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:19,990
disinfect that particular problem to

477
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:22,620
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows one care which is a</font>

ongoing keep you safe scanners machine

479
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,479
type system I think an interesting thing

480
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:32,440
to note is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones in green are</font>

481
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:34,680
actually free that there's no cost to

482
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,270
use any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these any of these green ones</font>

483
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">although the fact that there are some</font>

484
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:43,240
ones to pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is is</font>

485
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:45,910
interesting in that when you pay for

486
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,900
something there's opportunities for for

487
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:51,580
generating revenue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hopefully</font>

488
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:55,050
are compelling to help make the business

489
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:57,010
case for dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with these problems</font>

490
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,659
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just another way of breaking</font>

491
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,850
down the various tools that that

492
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:03,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft happens to provide and whether</font>

493
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:05,199
they attack spyware viruses and whether

494
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,649
they scan once you know one-shot deals

495
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,780
or they do they keep working overtime

496
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:16,150
are they free or is it something that

497
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:17,649
that there's revenue involved but so I

498
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,230
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably agree</font>

499
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,570
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's their systems today</font>

500
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:24,100
that help you do this stuff and

501
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,770
hopefully what I'm presenting is is

502
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,810
going to make that easier but really we

503
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:32,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a business case about why</font>

504
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:35,080
we're doing this and so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

505
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:37,690
personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> theory that that if we if we do</font>

506
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,970
this together it benefits everyone that

507
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:43,660
customers get the that are broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

508
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:45,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">get fixed and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they get they benefit from</font>

509
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:49,510
a cheaper safer better internet

510
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:52,389
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs for instance i think</font>

511
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:54,370
it's it's it's worth admitting that that

512
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,580
the reactive stop it before it<font color="#CCCCCC"> hits me</font>

513
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,800
problem approach isn't going to solve

514
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,659
the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in fact I would argue it</font>

515
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,730
just sort of lets it fester behind our

516
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,039
shield of of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not hitting our</font>

517
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:08,320
customers

518
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,299
in fact I would argue that that the

519
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,340
sunlight some might say that that

520
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:14,200
cleaning yourself up for the sake of

521
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:16,840
making the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet better place is kind</font>

522
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,309
of altruistic but I think there's an

523
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,230
argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for it to be saying that</font>

524
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:21,610
that making selfish if if we want to

525
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">really get rid of this problem to stop</font>

526
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:27,070
paying these you know costs then I think

527
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:30,340
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a valid way to get it to really</font>

528
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:33,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal with this problem and so my skin in</font>

529
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">the game is just I want to get benefit</font>

530
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,519
as just one of one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the many people on</font>

531
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,049
the internet who when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shut down</font>

532
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:40,269
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad on the internet it won't</font>

533
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:47,649
hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> me as well as not hitting the rest</font>

534
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:53,380
of the internet so I really I want to

535
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:55,149
zoom in on isp motivation the fact is

536
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,730
the customers they're you know they're

537
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:59,949
unhappy they're scared at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font>

538
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,659
some of them are actually broken and i

539
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,399
think it's it's reasonable that they'd

540
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:05,649
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really happy if somebody called him</font>

541
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:07,719
up and said hey we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been looking out</font>

542
00:22:05,649 --> 00:22:09,129
for you and it turns out you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

543
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem on your machine we're going to</font>

544
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:13,210
help you fix it we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

545
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:16,029
safe that to me seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an extremely</font>

546
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:18,760
compelling way of retaining existing

547
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:21,010
customers and having a strong story for

548
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:25,029
new customers or why they should buy

549
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:27,908
services from you and again it's

550
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:29,679
important to note that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can we</font>

551
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:32,679
can bandage the problem by doing port 25

552
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,870
blocking and stop the bleeding<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's</font>

553
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:36,850
clear that that truly fixing the

554
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,799
customer has more benefit and so it's

555
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:42,010
about extolling that that benefit and

556
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:47,740
and reducing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cost of that additional</font>

557
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:48,879
work now getting into costs it clearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

558
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,950
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone in this room would</font>

559
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,260
understand bandwidth costs and have some

560
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:55,240
idea of how much bandwidth is consumed

561
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">by sending all this traffic that nobody</font>

562
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,159
even wants around but another

563
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,429
interesting aspect is the support costs

564
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,169
there's both people that you know at

565
00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:07,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">your company that pic take calls from</font>

566
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:11,080
customers saying the internet is slow

567
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:12,820
and please fix it as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as people on</font>

568
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,199
the outside who say there's someone on

569
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,658
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network that spamming me please</font>

570
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,680
stop them and these these support calls

571
00:23:16,659 --> 00:23:19,780
represent real<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost</font>

572
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:23,530
the business and if we can make them go

573
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:25,600
away that's money we can save another

574
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:27,330
aspect of motivation though is the

575
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,980

576
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:35,530
excited and empowered to to motivate the

00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:37,240
this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of action and I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

578
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:40,389
understand better<font color="#E5E5E5"> what sort of role</font>

579
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:42,070
nanog might have in that so I have a

580
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,920
couple brainstorm ideas of a sort of

581
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:46,840
typical positive and negative

582
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,560
reinforcement I have a crazy idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

583
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">a windows logo is P program where one of</font>

cleanliness of the network the relative

00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:59,020
safety of the users the it's clear to me

587
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,460
that the government's interested in this

588
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,350
to some degree mostly it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the FTC they've had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of</font>

591
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,690
sort of stuff in the last couple years

592
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,330
but so as we all know it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is come</font>

593
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:16,420
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the business case and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

594
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:19,899
a presentation from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 29 hours ago about</font>

595
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,660
the future of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp industry we're</font>

596
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:25,000
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that that dependability</font>

597
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:27,130
integrity integrity and and value-added

598
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,200
is going to be the core of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP</font>

599
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,540
business and and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

600
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to go about that so</font>

601
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:35,560
basically I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> appeal to both cost</font>

602
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:37,270
reduction and revenue generation and

603
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,220
many people have pointed out that

604
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:42,520
revenue generation is often much more

605
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:45,700
interesting than<font color="#CCCCCC"> reducing costs and so I</font>

606
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,040
I appeal to you to appeal to marketing

607
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,380
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and to sales people about</font>

608
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:53,590
about the potentials here as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

609
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:56,500
go and attack the costs because in any

610
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:59,290
money you save is is money you save<font color="#E5E5E5"> vs.</font>

611
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:02,020
revenue generated as always as<font color="#E5E5E5"> according</font>

612
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:05,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to costs it's um it's not so</font>

613
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:06,820
unreasonable i think that that that this

614
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's worth going and doing these</font>

615
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,639
things that these business cases can be

616
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:12,100
made there was a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

617
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,070
presentation while ago about boston

618
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,719
university's business case where all the

619
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,110

620
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,090
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> represented a significant cost and</font>

621
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,560
danger to the to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> help desk and so</font>

622
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:27,550
they went and build a system to handle

623
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:29,460
this automatically as happenstance there

624
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,649
is a deal yesterday

625

00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:42,029
are business cases to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> made and and I</font>

629

challenge people to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them so</font>

are missing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I volunteer that their</font>

tools to to aid the customer remediation

from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allen Duran's talk it occurred to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">me that that we need a ipv6 support some</font>

639
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:12,840
point and and getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to a higher</font>

640
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:15,090
level how do how do organizations see

641
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:17,610
these costs and benefits what are the

642
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:19,439
costs and benefits by the on their own

643
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,100
and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they relate to each other and</font>

644
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">I realize that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these can be sensitive</font>

00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,689
issues sensitive numbers for the

646
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,939
organization so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I posit that that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may be</font>

647
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,529
nanog could aggregate numbers so that we

648
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,840
could understand the problem as a whole

649
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:35,640
and understand the situation without

650
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,000
anyone having to reveal any sensitive

651
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:41,279
information and lastly sort of you know

652
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,049
how do we get enough people using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font>

653
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,299
that other people find out about it so

654
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:46,710
that some networks are clean enough that

655
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:48,270
it puts pressure on other networks to

656
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,940
clean themselves up how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get to</font>

657
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:53,370
that critical mass and so one way you

658
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,190
can get feedback to to me is is this msn

659
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:58,139
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> smds that microsoft com which is a</font>

660
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,640
it's also on the website and that goes

661
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,039
directly to the team<font color="#CCCCCC"> that built the site</font>

662
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,820
including me and would be very

663
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:06,929
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> read your feedback and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

664
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,059
once people really get their head around

665
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:11,669
this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand sort</font>

666
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:14,399
of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it moves forward there's systems</font>

667
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:17,190
today that provide some data return path

668
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:19,229
has their sender base their systems like

669
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">scalp or our junk mail reporting program</font>

670
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:25,140
and then there's actually a sort of a

671
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,779
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> generation of tools that that are</font>

672
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,610
doing similar things Adam and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rick at</font>

673
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:31,200
support intelligence so you guys have

674
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard previously have a really</font>

675
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,340
interesting system they call react and

676
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,909
barely 24 hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I found out that</font>

677
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:41,010
Yahoo is interested in building a system

678
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:42,419
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're actually looking</font>

679
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,759
for beta partners

680
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:47,299
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> few if you see Irene ly walking</font>

681
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:51,539
around here you should grab<font color="#E5E5E5"> her and and</font>

682
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:53,549
tell her<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested so the</font>

683
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:55,230
question of should other<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISPs provide</font>

684
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:57,210
this data already almost seemed like a

685
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:59,340
foregone conclusion at this point but

686
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,080
then once once you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> there you know how</font>

687
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,029
does that happen how do we schema ties

688
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,949
the stuff how do we get authorization

689
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:06,119
models and authentication systems so

690
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,220
that it you know it's not a one-off

691
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:10,139
everywhere you go and what approaches

692
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,220
could be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve that and then</font>

693
00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:12,479
once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are starting to have this</font>

694
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion we have to figure out how</font>

695
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're going to have this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion is</font>

696
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,908
it something about for nanog is it a

697
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:20,309
track from all go you know where do we

698
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:22,769
go have this and to to try and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

699
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:25,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's at least a minimum</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forum</font>

700
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:27,710
for collaboration I asked to Dave

701
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:30,330
Crocker to set up a mailing list

702
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:32,690

703
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:36,960
it's it's not actually up just yet but

704
