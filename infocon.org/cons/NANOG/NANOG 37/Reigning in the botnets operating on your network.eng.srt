1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,279
so one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been</font>

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,199
playing around with lately is

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:09,389
understanding abuse and aggregating it

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,040
so that we can push it<font color="#E5E5E5"> back out to</font>

5
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,110
network operators so that they can

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,480
understand what their networks have been

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:20,400
seen doing to other people's networks

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:25,650
and a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of folks have have asked me</font>

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:28,680
about how do I believe you and after

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,169
aggregating all this information no no

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,019
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> just give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me the video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and good</font>

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,930
thanks so what I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:43,260
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of a bunch of slides is a</font>

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:45,899
real time yes make all this go away we

15
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,070
have a real time little data

16
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:53,180
visualization of februari eight I

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,739
believe Pacific Standard Time 5pm and

18
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:59,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">what it's going to show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you in just a</font>

19
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,288
moment is a global view of what happened

20
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:07,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">during this hour compressed into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

21
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:10,049
minutes and let me see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I can zoom in</font>

22
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,330
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> on North America and I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

23
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:16,140
a little bit about the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kinds</font>

24
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:22,380
of things that we're doing so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:24,030
februari 8 5pm what support intelligence

26
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,350
is doing is aggregating currently a

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:30,360
hundred and thirty different data

28
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:33,929
sources of those data sources ninety

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent of them are passive we have a</font>

30
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:43,579
spam trap that's aggregating 10,000

31
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:46,949
domains into into a very evil smtp that

32
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:48,990
filters and then bands<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP addresses for</font>

33
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,780
some length of time records all this

34
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,908
information stuffs it in database all

35
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,490
this stuff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> aggregating currently two</font>

36
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:01,079
point oh I'm sorry 1.2 million events

37
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:05,070
per day which comes out to about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 700,000</font>

38
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:08,068
unique IPS for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the global Internet what</font>

39
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:11,980
we do is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a number of BGP peers</font>

40
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:16,480
and aggregate the

41
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,480
into the announcements that are made

42
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,100
what we're able to do is then put this

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,700
into a tool that network operators can

44
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:32,450
use to visualize their<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP announcements</font>

45
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:35,829
and see drill down into each prefix

46
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:38,390
that's announced and find out the abuse

47
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:40,670
this particular tool is a visualization

48
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:46,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">of some of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information that we were</font>

52

53
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,440
the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what the issue is</font>

54
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:02,810
about the reason we picked 5 p.m. on

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,260
wednesday pacific standard time is

56

<font color="#E5E5E5">to you you can certainly give that to us</font>
