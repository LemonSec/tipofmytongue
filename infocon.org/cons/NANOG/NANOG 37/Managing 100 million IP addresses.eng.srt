00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,739
dream of a better introduction

00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,769
so good morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> my name is Allen Diwan</font>

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,080
from comcast I'm in the office<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:21,100
did you talk about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we need in</font>

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,780
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are our plans and most important at</font>

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,780
the end some of the challenges that were

10
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:30,740
so take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very simplistic view of</font>

00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:33,350
comcast's comcast is a very big

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,920
we have more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 20 million subscribers</font>

00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,920
in the video

00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,380
9 10 11 simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> I speak</font>

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:48,050
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at</font>

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:51,790
our video work today customers have set

suppose to me

00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,950
and the six local tribal

39
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,500
actually it's a lot of

it's like one or two a kid

43
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,459
plus you have me until here

00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,079
that's what

48
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,270
ask you the question

49
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:37,729
is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> better if I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk puzzle thank</font>

both on the 34th floor<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

51
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:42,570
asking is that going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a point</font>

52
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,810
another customer because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> run out of</font>

53
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,810
ideas

54
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:55,420
so the graph it's not actual data

55
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,919
such bands in bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the graph this</font>

56
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,150
is the natural growth of the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,620
subscriber between<font color="#CCCCCC"> AD</font>

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,820
the new services which we want to enable

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:06,710
click<font color="#CCCCCC"> OK</font>

60
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,710
and this is where clapping I people

61
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,790
so what do we do well<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at this in</font>

62
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,008
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> these six but this is not going</font>

63
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,030
to happen

64
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:21,160
we need contingency plans

65
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is to go to conversions</font>

66
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,400
to become<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for my address</font>

67
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,400
so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

68
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,600
until we can get

69
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,970
second plan for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to use what I call</font>

70
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,888
the dark space which essentially is be

71
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,820
obscene 19 18 times

72
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:43,470
use somebody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Atlas basis not advertise</font>

73
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,170
and we will use it internally this is

74
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,550
all for management doesn't go outside so

75
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:51,090
as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we can prevent them from</font>

76
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,710
leaking in or leaking out when

77
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,900
we could federalize a metro<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuji</font>

78
00:05:53,710 --> 00:06:00,448
breaking down our<font color="#E5E5E5"> lovely to a few</font>

79
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,448
smaller networks this is really what

<font color="#E5E5E5">Google disability</font>

81
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,300
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we but we started</font>

82
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:14,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">last year up to do some planning what we</font>

83
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,090
want to do is to deploy ipv6 of the

84
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,090
control plane

85
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,620
operations on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the edge devices that we</font>

86
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:26,190

ipv6 as a service<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

89
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,950
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we come at some point but by now</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">there is no demented</font>

91
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,270
so probably what we do is that we will

92
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,100
leverage our own infrastructure that

93
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,590
goes to d6 and make try to create a

94
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,480
further point some new services that we

<font color="#E5E5E5">just benefiting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisa can't really a side</font>

effect really again really want to

97
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,750
insist in this we want to deploy<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

management of

100
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:04,369
so some guidelines

101
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:06,740
deploying the six or so<font color="#E5E5E5"> possibly</font>

102
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:08,929
minimally disruptive there's a real

103
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,639
natural place you cannot disrupt their

104
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:12,650
revenue stream

105
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,629
we went to make sure that v6 in there

106
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:19,248
whatnot of all the next generation

107

Mitchell about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6</font>

110
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,050

all our systems that become ready to

113
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,770
support ipv6 devices in slowly that we

114
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,580
come into

name

116
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,830
good point what does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

117
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,349
the architecture is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really add an</font>

118
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:47,409
ipv6 address on this cable modems et

<font color="#E5E5E5">cetera box so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we will have a corner</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">trough that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will be dual stack TV for an</font>

121
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:56,169
ipv6 not tunneling no transition

122
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,880
techniques just your native ipv6 the

123
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:59,500
same things are that care exactly before

124
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,830
it's simple but works everybody a

125
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,830
sabbatical

126
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:08,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">then we will have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the edges ipv6 only</font>

127
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,590
devices that means that at the edges we

128
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,230
cannot afford to have 20 static if we

129
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,510
had an ipv4 address even not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ipv6</font>

130
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:18,000
in the first place so at the edges

131
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:20,599
beware of us millions of devices as to

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,600
the ipv6

133
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,190
so the deploy my approach will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

134
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:28,820
the core to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the edges so we go first on</font>

135
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:32,210
the bag one when our regional networks

136
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:35,130
went on CMT s which is cable<font color="#CCCCCC"> modern</font>

because a consistent

we give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you an example</font>

a major upgrade and 25 to 30 we needed a

this which is IP before as a transport

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,660
for example if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no SS stack but</font>

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:37,100
yes the MIBs is going to include ipv6

172
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:39,260
objects in it like IP address all the

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different back of these</font>

modern where we stained yellow I mean

00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:17,749
they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipd as a transport the tailored</font>

maybe a v6 of transporting

191
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:24,598
so some of the challenges

194
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,640
in the natural ipv6 is still very

195
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,860
brilliant technology in the level of

196
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,530
maturity of the implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> varies</font>

197
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,120
greatly some vendors have been doing

00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,980
these six for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between still</font>

199
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,710
had some problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show you one in</font>

200
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,600
lighting some of our vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

201
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:47,420
nothing today and they're going to

202
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,490
version by<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party ipv6 tag maybe</font>

203
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,979
add a third party application on top of

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:54,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and add to some I expect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it work</font>

205
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:58,970
so that's really

206
00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:01,250
plug-and-play cannot exercise so we are

207
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,890
going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to raise the bar of a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">level of acceptance likely this product</font>

209
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:09,410
that means

210
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,760
formerly explain what ipv6 means to the

211
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,640
Vandals because if you simply say

212
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:17,240
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> check boxes ipv6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean</font>

215
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:22,550
with you lately research doesn't work

216
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:25,010
for me so what I'm doing is I'm creating

217
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:27,500
a list of our sales that I really want

218
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,330
this product to comply if it's a server

219
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,760
that's a router if it's a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

220
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:34,220
or if it is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating system is a CMT</font>

221
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">s2 food so each of us probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

222
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:39,470
compiling the list and then I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

223
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:42,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">add some kind of confirms certification</font>

plan against those petitions criterias

225
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,760
and today there's unfortunately not that

nobody really cares about that's not

in the provisioning system power this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">where we have the most</font>

266
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:34,559
I was expecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to be as well but</font>

267
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,559
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what we want</font>

268
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,410
from an ipv6 protocol perspective we run

269
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">also on to some surprises especially</font>

00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,100
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> memes</font>

271
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:49,990
at the beginning of the times ipv6

272
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:54,880
working group at IDF has declined lastly

273
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:56,710
2465 as<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up me to ipv6 couple years</font>

274
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,439
later I decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was not a good idea</font>

275
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:03,370
but they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an integrated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> made</font>

276
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,050
that has both ipv4 and ipv6 well the

277
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,540
reality of the implementations today is

278
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,869
that most everybody implemented they all

279
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,819
need that have only a beautiful

280
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:14,889
summarizes vendors implement the first

281
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:17,679
generation of nibs which was defined at

282
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,600
us on the ipv6 in some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our router</font>

283
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,850
vendors implement partially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new</font>

284
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,770
integrated needs but only<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be for</font>

00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:26,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Papa v6 part of the new integrated me</font>

286
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:28,600
and its own partial so put all this

287
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,940
together just doesn't work so it's a

288
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,159
call for commander I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> some new</font>

advocate RFC's when this ipv6 you mean

the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> one but the one that was</font>

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:47,629
some of the more internal questions we

294
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:50,870
used to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS blv 25 gb for you are</font>

295
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,810
looking at ospfv3 or is is 556<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm still</font>

296
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:56,209
in this one process to evaluate work

297
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:58,460
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> well what grade to basics some</font>

298
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,620
are forced us to reevaluate our strategy

299
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,600
univer there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with the</font>

300
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,550
quality of protocol it has to do with

301
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,740
the quality of implementations you are

302
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,590
hot math with the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> bundles</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

303
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:12,170
both is is always beautiful this is very

304
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get confused us get</font>

305
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:16,420
v2s building three they share the

306
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,420
acronym

307
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:22,710
so security

308
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:25,410
we have before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and v6 so we have a</font>

309
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,720
security policy for v4 so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can take the</font>

310
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:31,440
same security policy and associated for

311
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,720
ipv6 is it going to be enough I just

312
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know where this plain and simply</font>

313
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,809
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the contact an answer so we're going</font>

314
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,730
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead with that assumption but it</font>

315
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:43,260
is enough probably run into some

316
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:45,570
problems and then try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> QSR</font>

317
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,120
is another one so we have defined a

318
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:52,200
number of code points for qos users in

319
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,419
ipv4 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to define exactly the</font>

320
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,780
same code points uses a sim<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 20-0</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

321
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:59,460
56 us essentially i'm going to make the

322
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,980
assumption that routers are going to

323
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,890
drop packets<font color="#CCCCCC"> not only be four verses</font>

324
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,990
uses retire but on this pod point

325
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:09,690
cuchara so if it's a packet in before

326
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:11,309
but I've not as important as<font color="#CCCCCC"> important</font>

327
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,850
as a physics packet for that marked as

328
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:16,770
important so the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing mag network</font>

329
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,549
has to be agnostic tcp<font color="#E5E5E5"> for packets with</font>

330
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,869
a moving around of this expected

331
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:21,650
so what you have sumption that I'm

332
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:23,570
making right now

333
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,520
it was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very clear simply by looking</font>

334
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:28,659
at we are see this is what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

335
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,660
not so this is our choice

336
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:35,010
it's essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I want you to say</font>

337
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:35,010
some time for questions

338
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:40,120
this is not such a difficult exercise

339
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:42,549
mostly it has been going through<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

340
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,040
inventory process<font color="#E5E5E5"> which over to our</font>

341
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:47,139
vendors people like you in finding the

342
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:51,510
biggest kick and get

343
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,510
members we do

344
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:09,409
hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> david Huberman from air without going</font>

345
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:11,210
to the specifics of<font color="#E5E5E5"> comcast first of all</font>

346
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:15,050
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a wonderful presentation thank</font>

347
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:18,080
you comcast is huge in consumers mind in

348
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:21,590
North America so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go to be six it's a</font>

349
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,879
very big landmark I think so we see all

350
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,919
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to upgrade your</font>

351
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,960
back of the house all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the software</font>

352
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,240
upgrade your network you have to upgrade

353
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,360
this cable motors you have to spend all

354
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,640
this time retraining staff training new

355
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,969
staff so the obvious question becomes

356
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,490
cost how do you sell what I have to

357
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:44,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine is a gigantic cost to move to</font>

358
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,650
ipv6 to the 44th floor whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say</font>

359
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,380
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> selling it to them or do they</font>

360
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,970
sell it to you well they hired me to fix

361
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">the problems so some of our selling it</font>

362
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:55,880
to me so they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> very when last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font>

363
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:58,159
or year and a half ago somebody came and

364
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,810
says well we are running out of space we

365
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,070
are making<font color="#E5E5E5"> this request to Erin we are</font>

366
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,409
not sure it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be accepted or</font>

367
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:06,770
not they really went into panic mode

368
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:10,119
because if you cannot get<font color="#CCCCCC"> addresses that</font>

369
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:13,918
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the business stop growing</font>

370
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:13,918
and whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost is this is</font>

371
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:20,829
essentially business continuity need to

372
00:21:17,949 --> 00:21:23,879
make sure about your<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ones the</font>

373
00:21:20,829 --> 00:21:26,009
cost the cost is non-negligible

374
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:29,029
it's compact<font color="#CCCCCC"> Akira they're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

375
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:29,029
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> billions of dollars</font>

376

Lane press<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday over here hi I had</font>

377
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:45,020
essentially a similar question and it

378
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:47,600
really was the upper management support

379
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:50,660
kind of issue this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is certainly</font>

380
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,449
something that a number of us have heard

381
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:56,420
in terms of not wanting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put my</font>

382
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,610
because it costs money to do this and so

383
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:01,460
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> from what you've described there</font>

384
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:04,340
is an extremely strong business

385
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:06,440
motivation reason for doing it in in

386
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:12,409
case the contest and I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

387
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:14,480
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good object lesson for four others</font>

388
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:16,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that may have some similar kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

389
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,320
situation because what specifically I

390
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:21,910
was going to ask this do you have upper

391
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:24,919
management support and clearly you do

392
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:29,330
yes I have and maybe the best way to

393
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:31,490
describe I have there to say I must<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

394
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,679
an open talk to all the upper management

395
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,930
and all the flaws in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my building I can</font>

396
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,760
see them almost whenever I need it's

00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:41,330

401
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:51,779
I get actually much more pushback from

402
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:56,009
the low level management from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> upper</font>

420
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,379
so we have been looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at things like</font>

421
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:51,600
making sure that we have only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one stream</font>

422
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,299
of multicast today we have before so we

423
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,969
probably get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it before and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you need</font>

424
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:58,889
to have against its magic a stream

arriving to a set of balls somewhere to

428
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:08,720

running twice<font color="#CCCCCC"> named ultimate</font>

430
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:16,289
so far this is again all for managing so

431
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,419
we don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain multicast</font>

for certification

437
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,250
could you comment

438
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,090
serving his knee

439
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:52,240
I've been looking at the ipv6 for the

00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:53,980
logo program phase<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 and phase 2 this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

441
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly a good step in the right</font>

442
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,690
direction<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is clearly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough so</font>

443
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:01,900
it's a

444
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:04,130
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> v6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logo phase one tasted was really</font>

445
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,690
deep into neighbor discovery

446
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,970
let's go on to different weird

447
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:09,800
situations in

448
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,800
so it's going really deep in that

449
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:15,290
direction that says nothing about do you

450
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,290
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> news says nothing about parting</font>

451
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:21,020

452
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:22,070
transport over them<font color="#E5E5E5"> infinite so this</font>

453
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,889
clearly a step in the right direction

454
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:27,710
but we need to go above<font color="#E5E5E5"> that well the</font>

455
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:30,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">both we are going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use this as a</font>

minimum entrance criteria for our van

doors open so if you have an operating

462
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:47,419
dynasties your plans are to do that

463
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,800
through the form and existing facilities

464
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,560
or

465
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:55,570
we has a private adventure we will do

466
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,570
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> with whoever wants to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it with us</font>

467
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:02,090
I'm talking to<font color="#CCCCCC"> some privately to sum</font>

468
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:05,630
over large ISPs

469
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:08,539
similar interests and me do<font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> loan</font>

470
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:10,900
with both guys already formed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

471
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:10,900
open

472
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,330
so I had a question in terms

473
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,690
some priorities

474
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,690
features letting

475
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:40,649
so far we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad critical response for</font>

476
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,240
most of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vendors just because he said</font>

477
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:44,928
comcast is a very big company nobody

478
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,009
wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is comcast as a customer</font>

479
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:51,529
there are some instances where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font>

480
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:51,529
to raise<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pressure thank you</font>

481
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,889
the one excuse me young one comment you

482
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,690
made early on was your doing this with

483
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:03,510
management because you're not seeing any

484
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:05,040
demand and I'm sure you're well aware

485
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,750
that customers are never going to demand

486
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,810
I bb6 because they shouldn't know

487
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,890
protocol versions so how are you going

488
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,750
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point where you're</font>

489
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,970
supporting it to the consumer what's the

490
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:19,140
decision point for deciding it's more

491
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:21,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">than just management it's a question of</font>

492
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,770
services the way we look at our

493
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,970
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what kind of service we can</font>

494
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:28,740
send them so now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will have is v6</font>

495
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:31,200
infrastructure in place<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of our</font>

496
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,480
product engineering people would say how

497
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">has this new service that i can create</font>

498
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,520
and sell to my customers and make money

499
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,930
with it by the way this thing will which

500
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,320
are what we visit so we have this

501
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:45,770
exposure case we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will do it that would</font>

502
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,770
be a preacher

503
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:56,680
so impossible genetics Adam as you

504
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,500
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> down you gave a good breakdown</font>

505
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,810
of why comcast<font color="#E5E5E5"> moots hundred million IP</font>

506
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:06,580
addresses if I understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> it correctly</font>

507
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:09,310
you're using ipv4 right now so do you

508
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:11,710
use a pub like a pool of<font color="#E5E5E5"> public</font>

509
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:14,530
allocated a million IP addresses are

510
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:17,170
they are globally routable<font color="#CCCCCC"> are use</font>

511
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:22,000
private IP addresses for this hundred

512
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:24,520
million ipv4 addresses right so we don't

513
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,890
have wondered<font color="#E5E5E5"> minion right now we are</font>

514
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:31,870
going to what 100 me so we went our way

515
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:34,120
from private addresses because we didn't

516
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:36,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">have enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 73</font>

517
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,560
we're going to get more and more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

518
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,300
public addresses so as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we can</font>

519
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:43,570
use most public addresses that's what we

520
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:46,180
will do and if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not ready when</font>

521
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,770
the pool will dry up then one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

522
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,620
plans as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned is to use what I</font>

523
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:52,570
call the dark space which is using other

524
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,610
addresses that are not routed globally

525
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,800
but only internally so we are never ever

526
00:28:54,610 --> 00:29:00,250
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to advertise outside leaked out</font>

527
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:03,330
lsat assistant work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so right now</font>

528
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:03,330
can I ask you

529
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:08,379
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really lose the future</font>

530
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:11,500
requirement under million I be 100

531
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:14,260
million IP addresses so right now you

532
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:17,080
are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that space now right now we</font>

533
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:20,320
are using network 73 so that doesn't use

534
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:23,470
IP so I'm not familiar with what's

535
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,060
network 73 in general let's just public

536
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,010
address space that was allocated to us

537
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,379
by heroin so we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

538
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:31,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have addresses which was allocated</font>

539
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,940
to us by our<font color="#E5E5E5"> anywhere using it when we</font>

540
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:38,520
were but now to get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more it's at</font>

541
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,520
some point they will say no<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you</font>

542
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:49,430
can't hear you hi Bora are killed from

543
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:51,810
broadcom you mentioned is also in the

544
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:54,750
certification process right there's

545
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:57,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">plenty of plenty to choose from plenty</font>

546
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">of different RFC's that obsolete each</font>

547
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,760
other etc the other thing I wanted to

548
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:06,000
ask is ipv6 is a very richly option

549
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:07,440
protocol compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to before just think</font>

550
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,370
about neighbor discovery which you

551
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,680
mentioned so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you decide which</font>

552
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:16,709
options of for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> neighbor</font>

553
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:20,190
discovery or any other ipv6 mechanism

554
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:22,770
that you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use and are you going</font>

555
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:27,060
to publicize this to your vendors

556
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:28,860
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you just say RFC 2461 this or</font>

557
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:31,860
whatever the RFC never happens to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

558
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:36,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know let's see they're still</font>

559
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:38,820
like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000 options in there oh yeah</font>

560
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:40,410
I'm well aware of that but there's an

561
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,000
even worse than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in there are cases</font>

562
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:44,550
where there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

563
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,680
doing things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> gauge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cpv six or so</font>

564
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:49,110
stay closer to configurations awkward so

565
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:52,350
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> most cases for the cable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> modem space</font>

as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned earlier we are big DGP</font>

shop people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very confortable with it</font>

569
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:01,020
and simply going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the same thing so</font>

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> this reason why we said for cable</font>

of granularity this is a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

where we do peering with other ms-dos

because I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't it's just too</font>
