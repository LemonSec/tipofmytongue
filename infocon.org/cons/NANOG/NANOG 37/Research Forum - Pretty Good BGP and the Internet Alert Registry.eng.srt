5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,518
last few months what we try to do is

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,470
address the question of what can an

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,230
autonomous system do to protect itself

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,619
from prefix and suffix hijacks with

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,550
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> of today</font>

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,140
and so researchers so far have suggested

11
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,120
things like well why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you monitor</font>

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,250
your BJP updates and try to classify

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,260
certain round sighs you know this is

14
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,920
suspicious<font color="#CCCCCC"> and potentially a prefix</font>

15
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hydra well the problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with that is what</font>

16
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,520
is a router supposed to do so it's

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,500
potentially a hijack can you just wrote

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,600
can you drop it well no because it's

19
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">only potential it could be a completely</font>

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,470
legitimate route and dropping it could

21
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,879
cause reach ability issues so instead

22
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,610
today we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just accepting routes by</font>

23
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,460
default and accepting routes that we

24
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:01,370
know are most likely harmful so pretty

25
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,790
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP introduces a third option two</font>

adaptive solution it's simple and for 24

problem verify it and fix it

39
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,679
so let's look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the algorithm you</font>

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,320
monitor your bgp update messages and you

41
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">start correlating what prefixes are</font>

42
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:54,490
associated with what origin autonomous

43
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:57,280
systems and as you receive a BJP update

44
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,229
that has a new origin as4 a prefix then

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,869
you can say oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is potentially</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

46
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:04,060
prefix hijack in which case<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to delay it and I'll lower its</font>

48
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,630
local preference and for 24 hours if

49
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,399
it's still there afterwards well and

50
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:12,340
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll trust it or in fact I do</font>

51
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:14,830
trusted now let's look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at sub prefix</font>

52
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">high dose you keep a list of the</font>

53
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,700
prefixes you've seen recently and if the

54
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:21,280
new prefix is introduced through an

55
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,929
update and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's wholly contained within</font>

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,569
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the prefixes you've used or</font>

57
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,250
you've seen recently in use then it

58
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:30,488
could potentially be a sub prefix hi

59
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,530
jack and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> response to this is 24 24</font>

60
00:02:30,489 --> 00:02:34,840
hours not use it and instead keep

61
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,360
forwarding your packets on to the less

62
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,280
specific net which you are doing anyway

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,230
and then if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still around 24 hours</font>

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,650
later trust it incorporated into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

65
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:47,530
router so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at an example</font>

66
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:50,530
here's a prefix hijack a is one which is

67
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:53,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">green has announced 99 / 84 let's say</font>

68
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:55,989
months on it and suddenly a s6 comes

69
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,700
along it says I a man originated as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 99</font>

70
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:02,650
/ 8 as well well in this scenario a SS

71
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">two and three are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to select one</font>

72
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:11,650
and four five<font color="#E5E5E5"> and seven will select six</font>

73
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:13,359
but had a s5 deployed pretty good bgp it

74
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,900
would have trusted as1 for all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

75
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then suddenly a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is six</font>

76
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,069
is the same prefix and it would consider

77
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that suspicious and say all right I'll</font>

78
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:22,640
accept you provisionally but for 24

79
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,459
hours I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep writing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to one</font>

80
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,629
and the side effect is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire</font>

81
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:28,629
network routes correctly

82
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,238
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright a sub prefix Hydra these are a</font>

83
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:36,459
little bit more damaging so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s1</font>

84
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,489
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ounce 99 / 8 for a significant</font>

85
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,440
period<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time and a s6 announces the</font>

86
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:45,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">exact same address space using more</font>

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:49,390
specific networks and since routers

88
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:51,849
forward packets along the most longest

89
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:53,829
matching prefix everyone's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

90
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:57,640
afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> their packets 26 and skip that on</font>

91
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:59,470
one but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again at a s5 deployed pretty</font>

92
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,839
good bgp to protect itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and its</font>

93
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,540
customers it would have seen these new

94
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,940
prefixes that were so prefixes of 99 / 8

95
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:10,750
not trusted<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and kept on forwarding</font>

96
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:12,670
to a s1 for the 24 hours something

97
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting about this is that a s5 is</font>

98
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,289
acting in its own self-interest it

99
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,899
protected itself in its customers

100
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:22,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">however the rest of the network received</font>

101
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,409
benefit from this so what kind of

102
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,350
deployment would you have to see a

103
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:29,320
pretty good VG p in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

106

deployment strategies where first we

107

said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's randomly deploy a pretty</font>

108
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:43,000
good VG p on some fraction of the

internet what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen um so we</font>

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at let's say is zero zero percent</font>

111
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:50,349
deployment on our infer to pology where

112
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,810
that's bgp today right so we're looking

113
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:54,810
at the top loin right about<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

114
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:02,330
and today on average<font color="#E5E5E5"> half the network is</font>

115
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:05,039
going to route to the bogus origin<font color="#CCCCCC"> es</font>

116
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,770
however and as pretty good bgp is

117
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,599
deployed few and fewer people do and the

118
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,240
network is safer but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the best</font>

124
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,509
let's say I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the core autonomous</font>

125
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,940
systems and deploy their first and then

126
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:29,430
add random networks after that well what

127
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,860
kind of effect would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be so we're going</font>

128
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,229
to define core a SS as those with

129
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,580
arbitrarily at least 15 peer-to-peer

130
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:40,740
links and our<font color="#CCCCCC"> invert apology and we</font>

131
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,960
announced our we deploy it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there first</font>

132
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:46,949
in this case there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only 62 out of the</font>

133
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,659
nearly 20,000 a SS right and once

134
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:50,840
they've deployed then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have zero to</font>

135
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:53,490
one hundred percent of random after that

136
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,549
so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have zero percent random</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

137
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,770
the 60 to create pretty good VG peak or

138
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,539
a SS and we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the two percent</font>

139
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,090
of the network is protected for the

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:05,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">24-hour period on</font>

141
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:09,210
and it only gets better if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

142
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,410
subpubic side x then you see that you

143
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,789
know they're a little bit harder to

144
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,830
suppress there are more effective

145
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:18,750
attacks but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

146
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:20,310
results now these hijacks have been

147
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">around for what like nearly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font>

148
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:26,010
now and they aren't going away on their

149
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:29,250
own so there's the canonical example of

150
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:31,710
97 where a s 7007 cook down the net for

151
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:35,150
two hours but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot of other</font>

152
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:38,099
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> so at the last man on booth at all</font>

153
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:40,289
estimated that there were 26 10 and 95

154
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:44,100
successful high drives just in last

155
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">December on the nanog mailing list</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

156
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,300
partook in an interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion</font>

157
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:50,460
about panics<font color="#CCCCCC"> to / 16 being stolen by</font>

158
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,730
coned and that was well documented by

159
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,120
Todd<font color="#CCCCCC"> Underwood</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then something I</font>

160
00:06:53,730 --> 00:07:01,740
think is an interesting attack is that

161
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:05,610
Tina announced for / 88 / 8 and 12 / a

162
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:08,160
right and sprint and<font color="#E5E5E5"> vario carry this</font>

163
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,600
this is something pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp found</font>

164
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,270
for me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i haven't heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussed</font>

165
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,660
anywhere else but something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could</font>

166
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,659
have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> prevented</font>

167
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:21,210
so all right we have 24 hours now in

168
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:24,250
which to verify<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new tag is in fact</font>

169
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:27,580
right a suspicious<font color="#CCCCCC"> relat is in fact hi</font>

170
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:29,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">duck attack and if you don't stop it in</font>

171
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,030
that period<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time well pretty good bgp</font>

172
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:33,039
will allow it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go in accept it and</font>

173
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,049
then the attack could be successful so

174
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,820
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to verify attacks</font>

175
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:41,590
with low human overhead um this is

176
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,270
actually a simple problem since we've

177
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,989
slowed the progress of the attack down

178
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:49,799
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> human time scale you can actually</font>

179
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:52,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">have humans do the verification and</font>

180
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:57,340
there are really only two entities that

181
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:59,919
can with any kind of validity verify

182
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">Iraq which are das is having their</font>

183
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:06,219
address space stolen and the AES is

184
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:07,949
joining the attack so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the</font>

185
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:12,130
internet alert registry comes into play

186
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:14,830
it monitors suspicious routes and tells

187
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:17,100
these two parties via<font color="#E5E5E5"> email about the</font>

188
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,099
attack

189
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,480
and this is not a ubiquitous deployment

190
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,670
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> required you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opt-in you</font>

191
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,620
just give it your<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iar your email</font>

192
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,480
address and the AAS numbers you would

193
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> monitor and you'll receive</font>

194
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,890
alerts as they occur and the overhead is

195
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,380
absolutely minimal I am monitored like

196
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:38,348
five or six<font color="#CCCCCC"> tier 1 a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SS on our prototype</font>

197
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:42,360
I AR for about a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten day period</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and on</font>

198
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,360
average they received one alert per day

199
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,070
so there have been a lot of other

200
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,960
solutions that many of you are aware of

201
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:53,600
such as since the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of prefix</font>

00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:55,890
hijacks s<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> solution that</font>

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see come into play</font>

204
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean full path verification is</font>

205
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,380
something we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> all like it's an</font>

206
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,540
ideal thing but in the meanwhile while

207
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,790
people are trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy and figure</font>

210
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:13,950
significantly affected there's anomaly

211
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,420
detectors which I discussed that they

212
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,310
suggest monitoring your outs but don't

213
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,430
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very effective way of stopping</font>

214

tax and there's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> good practice I</font>

215
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,540
mean you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> employ around filters</font>

216
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,160
but the nice thing about right around

217
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,780
filters is that they protect the

218
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,640
internet from you and your<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers</font>

219
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,770
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to go the other way</font>

around<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know what an AAS three</font>

222
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:41,880

236
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:14,880
receiving alerts for your asu can do so

237
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,560
and the paper also discusses a lot of

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,700
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like implementation issues</font>

Matt peacock Galu I noticed that you

246
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:53,930
focus on sub prefix hijackings there any

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,910
we couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop those as well it's just</font>

251
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,369
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually stealing</font>

252
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,020
address space with a super net so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">true spammers can use this but you're</font>

not stealing anyone elses traffic no but

255
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,670
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could delay it for 24 hours a</font>

wood I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> whack ball yes and and</font>

257
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,050
that's that's a great option

258
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:24,380
my blood the UCLA I had a question so

<font color="#CCCCCC">you see a new route coming up on new is</font>

announcing and you delayed for 24 hours

261
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:34,520
what happens if the primary<font color="#CCCCCC"> is withdraws</font>

262
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:38,060
it out in that period and so in that

263
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:41,930
case then the routers will select<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:45,489
bogus round but this is that I mean it's

00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">a pretty good bgp it's not perfect</font>

so like a man in the middle attack where

00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:14,079
I'm going to hijack a prefix and I know

it as1<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tracy announced that prefix well</font>

yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that's I consider that</font>

280
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,140
amount on the middle type of attack

281
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,970
where I can fake the rest of my path

282
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,580
behind me but you're not in the middle

283
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,850
because you just sing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right right but it</font>

284
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,020
looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're in them afraid no um</font>

285
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,900
this is what we're going to look at next

286
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,939
actually it's a real problem and and any

287
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of intelligent adversary with would</font>

288
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,920
attempt though so we're what we're doing

289
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:52,470
right now is stopping the most common

290
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,839
attacks that you see today due to miss

291
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:59,329
configuration and then my other question

292
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:01,560
actually was on the alert mechanism

293
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:05,010
villains hijack my three things

294
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right prefix my mail server resides</font>

295
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,760
excellent point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I highly recommend that</font>

296
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:13,740
you sign up with multiple email

297
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,740
addresses and have access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">considered rather than just malicious</font>

300
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,480
attacks what happens when

301
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,730
you know say some small<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP in South</font>

302
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,500
America leaks the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to a</font>

303
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:37,150
transit that doesn't filter them

304
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:41,130
actually yes and we've cut a number of

305
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">those instances actually pretty good bgp</font>

306
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,530
we those those leaks can compete up a

307
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,770
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of memory cause a lot of problems</font>

308
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,770
and

309
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:55,300
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> address that today but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

310
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:55,300
something

311
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:02,300
my main point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the origin</font>

312
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:04,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">has would be corrected in this case</font>

313
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,660
you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to also consider some</font>

314
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,689
logical

315
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:12,050
you know how likely if

316
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:15,380
so so you tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> leak more specific</font>

317
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,729
next right oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> see okay there's this is</font>

318
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,860
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that I didn't mention in</font>

319
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:22,040
the top if the leak or if they're out

320
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:24,770
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sub prefix Hydra is coming or has</font>

321
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the legitimate origin along the path</font>

322
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,100
then it's not considered suspicious

323
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,090
because it's going through a rapid run

324
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:35,330
through an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASU trust so a leak would not</font>

325
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:36,920
well what I mean is more like not it's

326
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,570
not malicious at all if it's a prefix

327
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,939
that would already be in the internet

328
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:43,040
it's just a Miss configuration something

329
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,019
that

330
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,990
they're just announcing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:50,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">their transit that they're learning</font>

332
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:53,320

333
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:54,910
right no it's the same prefix this

334
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">sisters title it just hasn't been</font>

335
00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:01,779
announced before who has already

336
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:03,310
announced just knew a SPF that's learned

337
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:05,430
from one friends it announced that the

338
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,430
up

339
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:11,990
I guess we should talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this online</font>

340
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,990
because I still don't

jared montz into the America I I was

342
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,170
going to just follow on to that trying

00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">to explain maybe</font>

344

<font color="#E5E5E5">what he was talking about is that</font>

346
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:30,110
periodically we've seen cases where

347
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,480
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a low speed link like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> t1</font>

348
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,129
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll leak a number and we'll just</font>

349
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:39,040
not be filtering both of their up

350
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:41,050
the filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then some better paths</font>

351
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,410
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be seeing through some customers</font>

352
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,410
and

353
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:49,560
something something

354
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:51,810
and in that case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would have an</font>

small

<font color="#E5E5E5">I think instead of looking at just the</font>

359
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:01,959
origin he's wondering about having

360
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:04,779
looked at analyzing not just the origin

361
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:07,719
but what a s is typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> interconnected</font>

362
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:10,880
each other in building the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs for</font>

363
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,830
me from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire thing</font>

364
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,170
you know not just the origin but does

365
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:17,720
you know do you normally see<font color="#E5E5E5"> one two</font>

366
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:21,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four and then now it's changed to</font>

367
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,710
125 for so we don't actually look at

368
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,360
that right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that kind of</font>

369
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,680
problem would not affect us but it is

370
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,970
important to look at the whole path if

371
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,920
you want to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about men in the</font>

372
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,040
middle text which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where we're doing</font>

373
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,040
this

374
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:36,939
see the movie star

375
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,630
thinking about the state

376
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:45,709
grouts handles if you suddenly have to

377
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:49,220
shift<font color="#CCCCCC"> over to</font>

378
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:52,760
I think this works best in the situation

379
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:55,190
where operational changes of origin

380
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:59,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">has occurred as you said at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

human paste

382
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:05,189
but there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been studies showing that</font>

383
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:08,230
there

384
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:10,870
prefixes which seemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to oscillate at a</font>

385
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:12,970
much rapid rate much more rather great

386
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:18,010
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was wondering if you had given any</font>

387
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:21,250
consideration to studying behavior of

388
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:23,439
prefixes over a longer time period to

389
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:26,079
determine what their usual rate of

390
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,320
change was so that you weren't locked

391
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,629
into a 24-hour time 30 so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

392
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,210
actually locked into 24 hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

393
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,490
don't lose reach ability so if you if

394
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:40,059
your original connection drops and then

395
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:41,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">a new a s is the origin then it's the</font>

only option you have and it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> while</font>

397
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,178
it has a lower local preference they

398
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:48,520
will be used so you cannot know that

399
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:51,100
that that presumes that the original

400

route distrel ears yes if it doesn't

401

that happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you guys if so I'd</font>

really<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interested</font>
