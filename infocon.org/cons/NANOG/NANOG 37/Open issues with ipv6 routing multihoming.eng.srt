current trends continue finally we'll

sort of started putting some stresses on

what had originally been a fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> small</font>

network design that was never expected

never went anywhere there was something

<font color="#CCCCCC">of a revolution against the</font>

early again<font color="#E5E5E5"> then in the early 90s there</font>

was a small group of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that got</font>

growth and stifling their of the first

was running out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of class b networks</font>

actually solved you know originally

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,390
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> were three types of network sizes</font>

/ 8 / 16 / 24 s what we call them today

86
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,350
because just like with Goldilocks and

the three bears no it was one was too

88

just about right so everyone wanted that

that problem was solved but the other

the 32-bit address space was not really

a critical problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 1992 but it's</font>

today the result of the road group was

100
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:54,320
two efforts one a short-term effort that

101
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,119
in that evolved into what we call cider

102
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,680
today and the other was a long-term

103
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,060
effort that has sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of turned into ipv6</font>

for whatever that's worth there's a

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,800
design packet headers instead because

153

that was easier more fun you got to

several reasons so it was discarded and

162
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:23,210
most importantly and most fundamentally

163
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:27,620
clear separation of endpoint ID and

164
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:29,539
locator was either ignored because it

165
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,880
was people didn't understand the concept

166
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,340
or because again it was hard and we

<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shopping instead and then</font>

now on in fairness these are hard

178

past 15 years with ipv4 kind of

00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,510
suppressed and solved in a short-term

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">way but we're going to see in much much</font>

181
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,870
bigger context going forward if the

182
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,580
internet does become as ubiquitous and

183
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:08,840
wide scale as we expect it to anyway

stepping back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talking conceptual a</font>

185
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,549
little bit just wanted sex few brief

186
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,580
words about what the whole concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

187
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:17,450
endpoint ID and locator are again some

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,219
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may have seen some of this</font>

189
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,229
discussion and I don't have much time so

190
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,800
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this quick endpoint ID</font>

191
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:26,540
is by the name of one endpoint in

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,700
protocol exchange could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a process</font>

193
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,860
could be a machine something that

194
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,950
terminates a TCP session at one end to

195
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,500
another end point at the other end the

196
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:39,039
analogous thing in the real world is a

197
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,630
name like Dave Meyer or<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill Woodcock</font>

00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's who is involved in the</font>

199
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,919
communication you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> domain</font>

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,260

version of an endpoint ID although<font color="#CCCCCC"> dunno</font>

main names can also be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of abused</font>

203
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,460
for other purposes endpoint IDs have a

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,599
number of desirable properties

205

208
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,240
the endpoint<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs so a session can stay</font>

209
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,650
you know up forever as long as the two

210
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,190
machines are up and as long as there's

211
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:11,989
communication that needs to occur it's

212
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,310
nice if they can be administrative<font color="#CCCCCC"> lee</font>

213
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,960
assigned because they tend to be

214
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,510
assigned to organizations and by

215
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to their sub parts so the</font>

227
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:50,480
one area where they'll analogy with the

228
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,510
analogy with human names kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of breaks</font>

229
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,980
down but a human<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is a</font>

230
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,390
you know human identity is more than

231
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,020
just their name my name is sort of a

232
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:02,930
shorthand the other concept is locators

233
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,569
locator is essentially states where a

234
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,569
device or process is located in the

235

source<font color="#E5E5E5"> and destination addresses that</font>

237
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,910
you use in routing and forwarding today

238
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,069
well those are locators the real villain

239
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,800
a legate here is a street address which

240
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:21,830
can be specified to fairly high

241
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,620
precision<font color="#E5E5E5"> but doesn't have to be once</font>

242
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,660
you're far enough away from the

243
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,670
destination where all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the all of the</font>

245
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:35,030
the same to you for want the the

246
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:37,010
hierarchy associated with locators is is

247
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,540
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> along topological lines</font>

248
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,610
ideally it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is completely along</font>

speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> street city state country or in</font>

251
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:48,500
the case of the historical phone system

252
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,910
prefix and area code I realized that has

253
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,400
all changed since then actually there

254
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,930
are some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be learned about</font>

desirable properties that aren't aren't

issues again the hierarchical assignment

is according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the network topology to</font>

any transport layer sessions in general

268
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,329
locators are expected to be unique when

269
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,250
they're fully specified but you can

270
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,650
reduce the precision of what a locator

271
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,090
covers to reduce the amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> state and</font>

272
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:33,829
thus improve the scaling of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the writing</font>

internet architecture did not follow and

less specific prefixes are the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

279
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,599
and you can summarize that up at various

280
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,819
levels by shortening the prefix in the

why do you care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this why should</font>

stop reading their email long enough to

listen for five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in ipv6 and ipv4</font>

301
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:34,420
there are only addresses which try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

302
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:37,910
serve the purpose of both endpoints and

a very good job of either this means

topological in other words the so-called

<font color="#E5E5E5">provider based addressing which really</font>

isn't mean provider based addressing is

313
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:03,019
really topological addressing to make

314
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,329
the routing system scale but because

315
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:08,269
providers dictate well they build the

a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is why multi-homing is</font>

321

such a big issue this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font>

322
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:22,639
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main reasons why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their routing</font>

visible prefixes today even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

325
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:30,850
topologically the network really isn't

326
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:33,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">that complicated remembering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is hard</font>

327
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,019
dhcp doesn't really do everything for

328
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:37,100
you changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses disrupt sessions</font>

329
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:38,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is actually a kind of an</font>

330
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,410
interesting key point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was missed in</font>

331
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:46,279
the design of ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> that by embedding all</font>

332
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:48,019
of the full IP address in the TCP header

333
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">you basically make it very difficult to</font>

334
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:51,519
change addresses and do any kind of

335
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:54,259
remembering without disrupting sessions

336
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,329
third other issues we cut n occation is

337
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:58,160
used source based filtering you know

338
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:59,660
makes makes it difficult to do

339
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,189
remembering there's a whole raft of

340
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,860
reasons why remembering it's difficult

341
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:06,680
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> commingling locators and</font>

342
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,230
address locators and identifiers and

343
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,430
basically the fundamental issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

344
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,870
you can't make the net you can't make

345
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,149
the routing scale for large<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers of</font>

346
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">proto provider independent or</font>

347
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:18,510
topologically independent addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> aka</font>

348
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,630
multi-home sites

349
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,950
again why do we care well right now look

350
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,380
particularly looking at the ipv6

351
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,760
forwarding table you probably don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

352
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,890
because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reporting table is a few</font>

353
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,500
hundred entries it doesn't really invest

354
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:34,800
but that's true of any prototype network

355
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,880
in a lab or in an early adopter stage

356
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,040
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started to see a</font>

358
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,480
get adopted and you don't solve this

359
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:44,770
problem you're going to have you're

360
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,660
going to have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you're going to</font>

361
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,760
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing state growth state that</font>

362
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,490
growth of routing state that becomes

363
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,589
rather ugly rather quickly the larger

364
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,720
ipv6 address space gives you a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

potential for<font color="#E5E5E5"> more specifics and other</font>

366
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,330
things to make the routing table bigger

367
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:04,029
today by doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're effectively</font>

371
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,579
you get with with nats if you get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,170
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nats which is what all the ipv6</font>

373
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,050
proponents would like you to think is

374
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:19,180
nirvana suddenly all this hiding of

375
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,579
state goes away and you get even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

376
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,010
growth of the routing state again the

00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,959
scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ipv6 network is tiny and</font>

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:28,029
even the scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ipv4 network is</font>

00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:30,069
relatively<font color="#CCCCCC"> small compared to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where it</font>

00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,339
of that sort the scale the network gets

384
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,240
gets you know orders of magnitude larger

574
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,850
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all of them but their</font>

575
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:51,070
assumptions that kind of are looking at

576
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,990
what we could do without changing a

577
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,418
whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the current direction first</font>

578
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:57,910
assumption is that ipv4 of ipv6 will you

581
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this might happen there's some</font>

reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think that might not happen</font>

583
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:09,340

00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">by the IETF and company then I guess it</font>

588

indefinitely this is kind of important

589
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:21,879
because it means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to carry</font>

exhaustion what i mean by beyond address

598
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,550
exhaustion is that as the ipv4 address

599
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,750
space runs out it will get increasingly

600

and other stupid pet tricks in the

internet today what's the turn rate in

other words how fast is your CPU have to

be to deal with all these updates and

661
00:24:56,499 --> 00:25:00,369
withdraws what happened and then one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

662
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:01,509
the questions that Jeff asked is what

663
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:03,399
happens if we add more state to the

664
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:05,139
routing system so that you know for

665

security and such so that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cpus are</font>

even more heavily loaded jeff did a

that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ETF grow that kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of looked at</font>

00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,710

672
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:19,659
them in<font color="#CCCCCC"> detail but it's starting to look</font>

673
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:21,340
quadratic or exponential again and

674
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:23,169
that's bad because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to</font>

675
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,759
keep up with growth rates<font color="#E5E5E5"> or exponential</font>

676
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:27,220
even if you start out with a small

00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:29,109
number of objects the classic<font color="#CCCCCC"> example is</font>

00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,710
let me try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run through this</font>

689
00:25:51,369 --> 00:25:55,480
really quickly I don't really want to

698
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:16,059
do this is I look at the v4 routing

table and try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and project what the v6</font>

710
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:43,410
and the numbers I'm basing this on is

711
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,450
the Tony Bates cider report where it

712
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,130
says the number of prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

number of sight or aggregates that that

714
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:51,440
could easily be reduced down to if you

like I also looked at internal more

797
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:13,620
specifics for v4 there's two lines here

798

the top one it seems you're around 150 k

mark the bottom one is if you're around

800
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:21,389
the 50k mark this is based on the growth

their projections are quadratic when you

these are all likely to be multihomed

820

<font color="#CCCCCC">the last conclusion slide is that as a</font>

854
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,899
vendor you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a</font>

855
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,520
really good scenario back in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> late</font>

856
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,840
90s people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn over the</font>

858
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,500
years and just go cleaned up that's why

859
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,450
it became one of the largest growing

860
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,430
companies during that period<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time so</font>

861
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:50,920
from a vendor perspective you know bring

862
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:52,600
on the growth but<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long term user</font>

863
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,120
perspective and community perspective it

864
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,590
probably isn't really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> approach</font>

865
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,850
anyway in conclusion is there a real

866
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:59,139
problem here or we just a bunch of

have what one or two minutes for

904
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:18,070
the room do we want five<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes of</font>

minutes of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

908
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:34,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright let's let's do let's do the next</font>

909
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,650
three or four three or four questions

910
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:38,870
really fast questions and we're running

911
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:40,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">into break now more hopefully it will be</font>

lightning striking even the sky that

913

thief yeah I'm Steve elleven uh Columbia

914
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:49,340
University couple clarifications and you

915
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:52,340
I've liked locator ID separation since

916
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:54,919
literally 1986 a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things</font>

917
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:57,620
were seriously discussing the I PNG

918
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:59,930
Directorate I was a member<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the issue</font>

919
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,029
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there was no really well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> form</font>

920
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:04,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">fully worked out proposal for how to do</font>

921
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:06,050
it yep we had advice for people like

922
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,700
Vince surfer said we tried this way back

923
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:11,090
when and it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot harder than it</font>

924
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:14,000
seemed my<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments on security at you</font>

925
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:15,710
with authentication right not denial of

926
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,620
service where there's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> some open</font>

927
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:20,000
issues so it's it's a lot harder than

928
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,319
seems it's a good idea we want to go

929
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,780
there but it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot harder than it</font>

930
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,070
seems and I agree completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

931
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,260
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> i invoked your name in that</font>

932
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,490
context was that when we discussed this

933
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,320
on the mailing list you said that there

934
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:32,660
were no fundamentally insurmountable

935
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,610
issues here that still<font color="#E5E5E5"> might take but</font>

936
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,930
there and they're absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to be</font>

937
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:37,070
more work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this because none of this</font>

938
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,810
stuff is thought out beyond the

939
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:40,340
conceptual stage at this point yeah it

940
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:42,529
was not quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much ignorance of the</font>

941
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,790
issue in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye PNG director it is</font>

00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:45,830
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> might have gotten your precious</font>

943
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:50,210
my point<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we really did consider it</font>

944
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:53,420
thanks for the clarification Randy Randy

unsuccessfully I'm perfectly happy to go

983
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:29,960
already got an answer is there a

00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:31,610
mathematical model but look at the

NSFNET work done along those lines by

<font color="#CCCCCC">ICANN craig lebovitz did some of the</font>

997
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:01,310
moving question because it's based

998
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:03,410
somewhat on cpu speed it's based on

999
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:05,080
propagation time let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just imagine a</font>

1000
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:07,430
perfect network I don't see you enter

1001
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,710
let's imagine a perfect network with

1002
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:12,049
zero<font color="#CCCCCC"> timer for propagation and infinite</font>

1003
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:14,630
cpu speed<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay just perfect network and</font>

1004
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:16,460
it's come on a question for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> research</font>

1005
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:19,430
community could somebody come with a

1006
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:21,470
model but we tell me this where is the

1007
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,509
sky is this guy at 1 million wat is this

1008
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:25,759
guy a 10 million<font color="#E5E5E5"> watts is there's no</font>

1009
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,500
limit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that's an information</font>

1010
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,360
that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really really important if</font>

1011
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,330
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to have an answer to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1012
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:35,030
question but is is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay to go to this</font>

1013
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:37,060
let's get the cutting table<font color="#E5E5E5"> go that</font>

1014
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:39,170
sounds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fine research topic and I</font>

1015
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got to cut the lines off this</font>

1016
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:44,690
point so we'll take the last three that

1017
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:47,600
are at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mics I Jared I'm up here</font>

1018
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:49,190
mostly because Ted is forcing me sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1019
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,990
is that I said

1020
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:52,790
so what alternatives do we have for bgp

1021
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:55,399
or what are we doing to replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

1022
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:58,759
the long term for the question about bgp

1023
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,950
well if we have the existing NRI prefix

1024
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,150
length model right how<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we supposed</font>

1025
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away from that to something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

1026
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:05,690
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question the problem isn't</font>

1027
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:07,040
really bgp it's the amount of state

1028
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:08,150
you're carrying around and inventing a

1029
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,099
new protocol isn't going to change that

1030
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:11,630
impending a new way of propagating

1031
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:13,369
information doesn't change that you need

1032
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,660
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> really look at how you're designing</font>

1033
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:16,849
the routing system how you're doing your

1034
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:20,779
aggregation and help how completely you

1035
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:22,160
can be isomorphic to the topology yeah I

1036
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,810
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the I think those two are</font>

1037
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,970
potentially actually more interrelated

1038
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:27,170
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again the point of this is to</font>

1039
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:29,029
determine if there's if there's interest

1040
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:30,200
in actually working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution and in</font>

1041
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,970
getting a community of interest together

1042
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,149
for doing that I think there's interest

1043
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:37,819
but I think Randy point on the operator

1044
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:40,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">bernau is significant and the challenges</font>

1045
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:41,960
that faced with dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the IETF</font>

1046
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:44,510
and other things in the past have read

1047
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,940
and the question is can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1048
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:49,430
outside the IETF among the vendors the

1049
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,329
users and the providers they're gonna

1050
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,040
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live with this problem and</font>

1051
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:54,619
should we<font color="#E5E5E5"> bother if you're interested</font>

1054
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:01,160
hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try and get a significant number</font>

1057
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:09,920
I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make to your talk the issue</font>

1058
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:11,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> India and is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really about identity</font>

1059
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,740
preservation of identity between the

1060
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:15,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">endpoints is really what that's all</font>

1061
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:18,379
about and modifying it in middle

1062
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:20,599
modifies identity right first if it

1063
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:22,640
argues we're splitting if endpoint<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs</font>

1064
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:24,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">and cola and locators are commingled</font>

1065
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,200
into addresses then certainly that is

1066
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:28,460
true that argues for the split at the

1067
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,230
same time all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your security</font>

1068
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,690
infrastructure is built around that

1069
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:34,790
overload and assumes that the security

1070
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:37,010
can know what the identity is by looking

1071
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:38,599
at the same locator that's that's a

1072
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:42,410
problem and then the other issue that I

1073
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:44,119
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raise was Mike Adele was</font>

of the room understand the context

00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:05,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">right and Mike was also the one that</font>

various mailing lists to talk about
