1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:07,440
hi so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> mohair time from UCLA I'm</font>

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,769
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about real-time prefix</font>

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,150
hijack alerts and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> in particular I'm</font>

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,030
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this system called</font>

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">fast prefix hijack alert system that we</font>

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,680
have been designing at UCLA there's an

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting little bit of history behind</font>

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,448
the name my first name that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I came up</font>

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,698
<font color="#CCCCCC">with for the system I raised quite a few</font>

10
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,740
eyebrows and I only realized a little

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,880
bit later why because I decided to call

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:36,300
it prefix hijack alert in real time

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,730
which acronym to PHA RT and that didn't

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,468
make quite a selling point there so we

15
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,489
decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it fast instead and</font>

16
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:47,160
that's what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have right now so there</font>

17
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,629
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> three things for one this is a</font>

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,190
lightning talks on go to not<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

19
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go into a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> details about</font>

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,629
the system just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-level overview</font>

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,699
and what the basic philosophies there

22
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,949
are three things we identify off for a

23
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,468
<font color="#E5E5E5">security solution for prefix hijacking</font>

24
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:04,048
again prefix hijacking I'm assuming

25
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,430
everybody knows it worst you need to

26
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,430
first you need to see the bad

27
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,780
information the hijacked routes second

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,700
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to distinguish</font>

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,350
between the good and the bad that

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,210
whether it is hijacked or whether it is

31
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,880
genuine and third you need an incentive

32
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,589
to fix the problem current data

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,048
collectors like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ripe and refuse we</font>

34
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,060
believe have a property<font color="#E5E5E5"> one which means</font>

35
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,310
they can see all the bad information or

36
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,920
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the bad information prefix</font>

37
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,450
owners on the other hand can see a

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,979
candle what is good and what is bad

39
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,229
because they own the prefix and they

40
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:36,479
know who is announcing it also they have

41
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,340
the incentive to fix the problem so here

42
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,880
is to combine all three at one place and

43
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the idea of fast what we do is we</font>

44
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,829
we collect updates we actually look at

45
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,600
updates from route views and ripe these

46
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:52,199
are the existing monitoring projects and

47
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,570
we maintain this origin sets so<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime</font>

48
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,170
we see these origin set changes that is

49
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,789
that is an event<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us so that's so</font>

50
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,430
that for each effects of course and then

51
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,469
we sense report to the prefix owner so

52
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,960
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing here is monitoring the</font>

53
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,848
origin sets for each prefix and every

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">time we see origin set changes that is a</font>

55
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:13,369
new origin added to the prefix or an

56
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:17,089
origin removed from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> preset</font>

57
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:18,860
we send a notification again the

58
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,930
philosophies it's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> our problem</font>

59
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,250
to know whether it's a false origin or

60
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,620
not we'll send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the prefix owner</font>

61
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,860
and let<font color="#E5E5E5"> him deal with it this is kind of</font>

62
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:31,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">the main components of fast system we</font>

63
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the origin monitor which looks at</font>

64
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:36,170
route views and ripe updates and decides

65
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:38,870
on how the origin set changes from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

67
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,940
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> registered to receive notifications</font>

68
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:46,250
we use email delivery to send

69
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,379
notifications and I'll touch a bit in a

70
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,160
little bit i'll touch on what the email

71
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:54,170
delivery constitutes finally since we do

72
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,810
not distinguish between<font color="#E5E5E5"> false origins</font>

73
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:59,659
and true origins we allow this this kind

74
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:02,480
of filter block at the prefix side which

75
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:04,159
can filter out alarms that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not</font>

76
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,810
really important to you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example if</font>

77
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,909
your origin set is changing a lot then

78
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,260
you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in simple rules again</font>

79
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:11,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> details of</font>

80
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,060
this but you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to me offline and</font>

81
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll be happy to discuss</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with you this</font>

82
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,220
is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of how the origin monitor</font>

83
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,829
works is a simple example prefix in

84
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,889
question here is you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> a prefix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so /</font>

85
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:27,829
16 you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see right here let me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see if</font>

86
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:30,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can find my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok right here so you can</font>

87
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:33,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">see this this is the genuine origin some</font>

88
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:36,168
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> I species a new origin as a result</font>

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,139
the origin set which was 52 now becomes

90
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:40,730
52 and 110 so is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first instance of a</font>

91
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:45,319
new version coming up changes are set

92
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:47,510
and this generates a trigger

93
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,040
notification we look up the prefix in

94
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,590
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> table we see these are the email</font>

95
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,418
address is<font color="#E5E5E5"> registered and i'll get i'll</font>

96
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,160
explain in a bit why we need so many

97
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:57,919
email addresses actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> video needed</font>

98
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:00,680
but we recommend a message delivery is

99
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,510
critical because if<font color="#CCCCCC"> your prefix gets</font>

100
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,780
hijacked there is no guarantee that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

101
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:08,870
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach you by email so what</font>

102
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,760
we do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not guarantee the email</font>

103
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,379
delivery as much as increase the

104
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,629
reliability of the delivery<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what we</font>

105
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,608
recommend is you can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should as a</font>

106
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:19,039
prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> owner you should have to prefix</font>

107
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,570
blocks or two emails from different

108
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:23,000
prefix blocks that you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> register</font>

109
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:26,150
by also<font color="#E5E5E5"> in addition to this you can</font>

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
register using public emails like

111
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:31,260
hotmail

112
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,890
homemade or gmail etc and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this a</font>

113
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,510
local notification filter which<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

114
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,640
combine all these and send you just one

115
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,770
instance of every notification so you

116
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,530
won't really receive duplicates of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

117
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,150
same notification the same time you can

118
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply your filtering rules here to</font>

119
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,340
filter out some alarms the key<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is</font>

120
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:54,090
that we expect due to the topological

121
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,520
machinist the hijacker cannot hijack all

122
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,010
the routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we try to take and</font>

123
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,609
simulation results are obviously always

124
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:05,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a quick evaluation on what's</font>

125
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:08,280
the what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does this mean to you as an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a.s</font>

126
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,340
this is based on data from december two

127
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,080
thousand five what we did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picked</font>

128
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">up the routing table the entire routing</font>

129
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,419
table and mapped all the prefixes to the

130
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,510
last origin as the the prefix origin map

131
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:24,330
and we saw how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many notifications we see</font>

132
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:26,159
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a few cases where you see</font>

133
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,800
lots of notifications and again they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

134
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,650
very very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this origin set is</font>

135
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,240
unstable it keeps fluctuating but it's

136
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,919
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> between two or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three states it's</font>

137
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,800
just too frequent but in most cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

138
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:40,859
you can see right here let's say about

139
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,750
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> here the number of notifications</font>

140
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,380
that you expect per month is less than

141
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,880
10 unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course you do see origin hi</font>

142
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,210
Jackson which gets you in case you will

143
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,640
get a notification the key advantages of

144
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:56,880
this system it is readily deployable we

145
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,830
have a plan to get this actually up and

146
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,930
running with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> website so people can</font>

147
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,030
register we just use route fusion drive

148
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:06,120
data so we don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s to really</font>

149
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:08,580
change anything from them we don't rely

150
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,260
on cooperation from other<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks or in</font>

151
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,370
other words the hijack detection is

152
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:18,330
centered on monitors we do not need the

153
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:20,669
input of from the from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SS telling</font>

154
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,409
us what the real origin is since we are

155
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,419
just pushing out all the origin set

156
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,000
changes and let them<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide to use that</font>

157
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:29,010
again all<font color="#E5E5E5"> emails sent by us would be</font>

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,630
authenticated and since it's a single

159
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,330
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the image the authentication</font>

160
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,460
is not that<font color="#CCCCCC"> much of a problem finally we</font>

161
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,460
have a low overhead for deploying the

162
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,580
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm up on my last slide right now</font>

163
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,008
which

164
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,560
which summarizes what we have done and

165
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:47,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we have planned for the future so</font>

166
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,229
the first thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

167
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,508
data from archives and have a thorough

168
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:54,460
performance evaluation on the system we

169
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:58,150
have caught some known hijack events and

170
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,650
that have been in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past in the we are</font>

171
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the process of developing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a real-time</font>

172
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,219
system or near real-time system which

173
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,949
would maybe operate with a lag of two to

174
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:07,479
three hours the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottleneck here is</font>

175
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,900
how far<font color="#E5E5E5"> in vector from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tree is ripe</font>

176
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,979
and that that is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good actually if</font>

177
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,109
you're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in receiving</font>

178
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:16,000
notifications you can send us email and

179
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,400
keep in touch<font color="#CCCCCC"> with us we expect to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

180
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,740
the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing ready pretty soon and</font>

181
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ongoing efforts also involve a</font>

182
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,909
couple other different types of projects

183
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,650
one is a coward prefix hijacked so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

184
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:28,870
not the exact prefix but a sub prefix of

185
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:31,029
your of yours is announced that is also

186
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">covered in that and finally we also have</font>

187
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:35,740
this notion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a false last hop so the</font>

188
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,139
prefix might be registered but and the

189
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,689
origin might be same but guys announcing

190
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:42,819
a false hop to that original so that can

191
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:44,949
also be detected if you are interested

192
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:46,960
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> more details about how the system</font>

193
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:49,930
intricacies and you are encouraged to go

194
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,279
read or ask us about this paper we have

195
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">which will appear in usenix security</font>

196
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty soon and that's about it it's a</font>

197
00:07:53,830 --> 00:08:00,190
quick talk so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we have time for</font>

198
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,569
questions Danny<font color="#E5E5E5"> Macpherson I just have</font>

199
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,069
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> question actually in it I think it's</font>

200
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:04,870
you're probably touching on it with the

201
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:06,879
false last hop thing is that associated

202
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,740
with the origin a yes and the fact that

203
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> origin is could be spoofed and most</font>

204
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">people even do prefix filtering don't</font>

205
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,339
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a combination of AES and prefix</font>

206
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,949
they simply look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the prefix and so if</font>

207
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:20,560
it's registered so what could you expand

208
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:22,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">on what you're going to to try and</font>

209
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,819
obviate some of that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are going to</font>

210
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:30,128
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the false last stop based on origin</font>

211
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:31,900
is not so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix and I'm not</font>

212
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:34,630
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the origin is being spoofed</font>

213
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,189
is that what you yes so for example if I

214
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,419
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hijack someone's prefix and I</font>

215
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,209
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people are looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

216
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:42,069
origin a yes all I do is insert an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aes</font>

217
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:44,049
in there and it was the origin es of

218
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:46,149
this prefix on my jacket and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets</font>

219
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:47,439
around all these systems and so you got

220
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:49,630
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to watch that as well</font>

221
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,370
right and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's that's my</font>

222
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">concern with these kind of alerting</font>

223
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,150
systems is if anyone has even a bit of

224
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:58,210
clue about this they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just simply insert</font>

225
00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:00,339
a a you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

226
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,660
legitimate or<font color="#CCCCCC"> jenna yes is because the</font>

227
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,940
control plane data is completely

228
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,980
orthogonal other 14 path anyway so it

229
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:10,300
doesn't know it doesn't release that or

230
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:12,190
alert on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so if I spoof let me just</font>

231
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,680
get a question right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I'm AT&T for</font>

232
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,950
example and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to spoof my</font>

233
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,239
daughter saying you you can you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

234
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you are 18 t is that what you're</font>

235
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying I'm saying that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when i send an</font>

236
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,420
update i would say this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is coming from a</font>

237
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,010
70 180 or whatever the a s I'm concerned

238
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,349
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and nobody's going to look at</font>

239
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,210
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's nothing</font>

240
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,160
to stop that and so the the forwarding

241
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:36,850
paths will change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the AAS itself</font>

242
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,260
really doesn't matter so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font>

243
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question in more</font>

244
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,740
detail I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an immediate answer</font>

245
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:45,540
to you but I can talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you offline</font>

246
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this thing okay thank you thanks</font>
