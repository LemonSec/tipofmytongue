you could do to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> using DNS SEC</font>

today rather than wait like everyone

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,330
else so what's the status of the NSX as

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,369
far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most part I said that the</font>

standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that itself is complete there</font>

9
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,939
are still some extensions are being

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,910
discussed but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use the thing as</font>

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,320
it is right now they're at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least two</font>

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,630
implementations of servers that you can

choose from and one implementation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">DNS SEC were resolver in this kind so</font>

15
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:46,769
the pieces are in place the problem is

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:51,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">the data not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are signing</font>

18
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,640
of the protocol unless this happens and

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,070
the intersect for validation of data

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,609

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,610
same as parallel to the DNS three

22
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,500

23
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:12,630
to verify the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data there then go down to</font>

25
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,679

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,310
to do anything special the route would

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,890
ideally have to be signed but it is not

30
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:30,110
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely that it will remain this</font>

31
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:33,360
way for some time a long time probably

32
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,579
so far a very few<font color="#E5E5E5"> tlds have signed their</font>

33
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,200
data in particular that I'm aware of

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:43,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sweden Russia and org are working on it</font>

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:48,689
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's just three and there are a</font>

36
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,759
lot more so what you what can you do if

37
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,470
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> your zone to be signed if you</font>

38
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,540
talk to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who resolve your</font>

39
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:59,579
nameservers would benefit from having

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,890
get your data secure well the NSA does

41
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,408
have handles that allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a local</font>

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:09,090
policy local policy meaning things you

43
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:12,920
can tell your resolver how to do that it

44
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:15,200
it would do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to what's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">fine in the stripped-down protocol in</font>

46
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,799
them for instance you can have your

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:28,819
the DNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> secretary that you collect much</font>

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,069
like you to collect PGP keys around from

50
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,290
parties you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust and configure them</font>

51
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:35,420
statically in your bind configuration

52
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,870
and then if these people sign your zone

53
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,369
you'd be able to validate them the

54
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,989
problem with these is that's a manual

55
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,360
process and if you have too many of them

56
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:52,760
it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nightmare to maintain this</font>

57
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:55,840
stuff so what I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is a</font>

58
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:59,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">mechanism to try to automate these</font>

59
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:04,519

point into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the net validation process so</font>

61
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:10,910
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a an extension to the standard</font>

62
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,010
DNS SEC validation process it's a

63
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:15,350
something that's implemented on the

64
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:19,040
resolver side servers don't care about

65
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:21,019
this it is at least we think it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

66
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,989
matter of local policy you decide

00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:25,940
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to use it or not and</font>

68
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:29,299
what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it basically points your</font>

69
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:31,700
name server to a remote repository of

70
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:39,350
keys<font color="#CCCCCC"> that of course you'd have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to trust</font>

71
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:40,970
as a goodra positive case so far this

72
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:45,108
code for these in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> binary servers</font>

73
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:48,950
which you can download in use and I hope

74
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:52,640
more implementations will come around so

75
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:55,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the lv didn't look up in when you</font>

79
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:07,160
SEC validation and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a few if it</font>

80
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,220
fails if you cannot find the proper data

81
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,260
to validate the answer and you have this

82
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,920
the lv option for fear that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go</font>

83
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:19,719
then and do a lookup in the d lv three

84
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,719
so the standard process takes priority

85
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:32,800
and this is what you need to do to

86
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,800
configure bind to use this feature

87
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:37,939
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> you tell it where the</font>

doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you you can choose</font>

whichever you you want ok you can not

00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:51,960
only the code only allows for one right

133
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:59,090
now I think it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful if you</font>

other words you're asking me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust</font>

147
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:53,159
this yes all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think your</font>

00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:55,560
web pages and your security policy

149
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,990
therefore becomes a serious question and

150
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,790
should be published the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page has</font>

151
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,680
some information but just because it's

152
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,960
short I'll get say it now in the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Registrar authenticating their user</font>

156
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,679
because they have an established

relationship in the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you want</font>

158
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,440
to give the key it was directly then we

159
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:20,880
do just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the GP show me your key</font>

160
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:23,580
show me your face and I'll pop you know

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:28,770
that easier the trust key you're giving

162
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:30,719
me for dot de is indeed the real one you

163
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:34,439
probably have some record that you own

164
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,260
that domain right no no no I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

165
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,740

170
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:59,790

coasters question because his his

question i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> was changed you can</font>

175
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,899
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one d lv registry configured</font>

176
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,779
for any particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> point in the</font>

177
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:22,649
namespace for example at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root zone</font>

178
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:24,839
but you can configure one for a TLD that

179
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:28,529
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the one for the root</font>

180
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:32,880
if you want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the reason you</font>

181
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:34,950
would do that is if the owner<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a TLD</font>

182
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,800
was very paranoid and wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the</font>

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,260
only repository of the d lv keys in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

184
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,770
part of the namespace the example that

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:47,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">we usually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use for that would be dot mil</font>

186
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:50,270
certainly if com wanted to run a d lv

187

registry and try to get the world's d lv

188

<font color="#E5E5E5">keen information in it they could do</font>

190
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:01,189
that if every TLD wanted to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

191
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:04,260
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably find a certain amount of</font>

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:15,260
operate a<font color="#E5E5E5"> registry of the root level and</font>

196
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,540
my name is your question and I also run

197
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,540
Alice's registry which is a small domain

198
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:35,280
registrar and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> considering doing this</font>

199
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:39,000
and so if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have comm net org biz</font>

200
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,880
info us names when they get their

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,270
registry<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up I'd be happy to work</font>

202
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:50,670
with you on configuring your name to use

203
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:52,170
their d lv registry if that's

204
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,240
interesting it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I'm</font>

205
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:58,170
interested in in trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> out just seeing</font>

206
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:04,230
how DNS SEC works and I'm happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

207
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:07,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the extensions into Alice to do it Sam</font>

208
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:10,440
Sam<font color="#E5E5E5"> Euler Sparta I share some of the</font>

209
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:12,780
concerns I heard Randy mention about<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

210
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">sees ability to authenticate entries in</font>

211
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,920
their deal v tree and I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is C</font>

212
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,750
is not the best entity to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

213
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,089
deal v registry so i would encourage

214
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:24,030
those who are registrar's are running

215
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:28,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">dns registries to consider running a d</font>

216
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,790
lv registry as an alternative to is CS

217
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:40,040
it's an open market you don't need code

218
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,040
you really don't need code

219
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,270
thanks
