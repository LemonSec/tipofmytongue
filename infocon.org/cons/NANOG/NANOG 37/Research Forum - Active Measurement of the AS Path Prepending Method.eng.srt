00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:08,550
thank you my topic is active measurement

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,800
of the AAS pass for planning method it

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:15,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a joint work with my supervisor dr.</font>

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:28,919
we still don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the efest</font>

8
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,349
will be or in the internet or whether

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,440
they happen after we have prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

link in this talk I'll pretend and

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,379
active measurement to measure the effect

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,570
of a space repenting we have to perform

13
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,599
the measurement on a deal home stop

14

00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,989
measurement setup I have faced do home

19
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,820
stop guess I<font color="#CCCCCC"> named it as as home because</font>

20
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,509
I cannot disclose the information of

26
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,970
truck in inbound traffic of this is

27
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:30,240
first I annossy be completely spooked

28
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,759
Earthlings<font color="#E5E5E5"> was repenting on our one and</font>

29
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,539
then I collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> rouse from different</font>

30
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,540
vantage points

31
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:47,789
he is the result account number of a SS

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:50,579
on roust that we are l1 or l2 on<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSS you</font>

33
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:55,409
can see the repenting lengths on our one

34
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:57,928
I have been propelling with us<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero up</font>

35
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,659
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> five and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decrease it back to</font>

36
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:03,840
zero and each time when i change the

37
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,960
prepending length a wager for at least

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,670
six hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to make sure the</font>

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,500
internet or has converged and when

40
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,798
there's no depending you can see that

41
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:21,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are 102 a SS are using the rouse</font>

42
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:26,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">vol 1 and 29 or using the mouse wheel 02</font>

43
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:30,319
and this one is which youse are both

44
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:33,630
lanes that means they have it has from

45
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,690
multiple browse on to the beaker<font color="#E5E5E5"> p phase</font>

46
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,269
and when I continues increased

47
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:43,680
pretending length you can find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

48
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:47,760
number of a SS I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find in in a set of</font>

49
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,700
looking glasses or advantage cause there

50
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,450
are not consistent because when I

51
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,429
prepared the<font color="#CCCCCC"> brows may be changed and</font>

52
00:02:53,450 --> 00:03:02,519
some of the a SS on the previous route

53
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:05,400
may not be appeared on the later one I'm

54
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:09,210
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting that when I increase</font>

55
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,720
up to repenting length of three there is

56
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:17,040
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great exchange it means I prepend on</font>

57
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:20,690
our one up to three and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their most of</font>

58
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,630
the a SS are changed at this moment I

59
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:30,570
think if you do for pending is obvious

60
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:35,480
to fund fund it and when I decrease the

61
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:39,840
bag it may be difference to this house

62
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:44,429
that is um when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> prepared up to tube or</font>

63
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:48,480
a diversified the number of a SS on on

64
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:52,410
rouse<font color="#E5E5E5"> vol.1 or will our two or</font>

65
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:56,130
difference so an Emmy as the imbalance

66
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:58,350
different moment and I will talk about

67
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:03,359
these two phenomena in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the following</font>

68
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:06,180
presentation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

69
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,180
explain the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phenomenons I want to</font>

70
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:13,350
classify those a SS who was responsive

71
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:19,440
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pending here is a simple Rao</font>

72
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:21,450
change grabs before I prepared or

73
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,130
prepared to a certain for pending links

74
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:30,450
on our one of the rouse that s1 and s2

75
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:33,270
are using is like this and after<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font>

76
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:38,159
prepared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a certain amount it changed</font>

77
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:41,520
it to use the rouse<font color="#CCCCCC"> vol.2 so i classify</font>

78
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,920
these a SS with spare ouch angels as the

79
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,680
incoming length to the beacon<font color="#CCCCCC"> p face</font>

80
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,919
changed

81
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:55,889
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next hop of the Browse has been</font>

82
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:59,909
changed so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> s2 is roused to the bacon</font>

83
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:06,300
pieces on the next hop and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the human</font>

84
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:09,660
rain has have changed i classify those

85
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,150
are passive responsive such that they

86
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,639
didn't change the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> hole the means</font>

87

the next top of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Grouse to the be</font>

91
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,960
in most of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are introduced by those</font>

92
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:34,250
active responsive a SS the means the

93
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,979
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> hub and both of the next hub and</font>

incoming lanes of the dubrow's<font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font>

95
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:44,909
changed by preparing and for those they

<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't changed anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

97
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,550
there are non-responsive a SS

98
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:56,310
and with those non-responsive a SS some

99

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are located</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on our one or they</font>

are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Browse beer I'll one they</font>

101
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:08,460
use only<font color="#CCCCCC"> a one next hop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or when they</font>

102
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:12,389
when I prepend even 25 and some of them

103
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:16,560
are located and or using browse be out

104
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:20,160
too because i have only prepared on l1

105
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:25,680
so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't been affected but those</font>

106
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:29,310
passes responsive<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SS they may not have</font>

107
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,610
possible grouse or they have a high

108
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:35,430
local preference for that next hope so

109
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:38,460
that they are the route change mainly

110
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:41,849
introduced by those actives responsive a

111
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:47,310
SS that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these guesses are connected</font>

112
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:50,699
to so those active responsive a SS they

113
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,979
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> paddle shortest has policy so</font>

114
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,919
they have changed<font color="#CCCCCC"> the arouse according</font>

115
00:06:52,979 --> 00:07:01,199
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pad a space lanes and they also</font>

116
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:05,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">army do not apply any hard local</font>

117
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,300
preference to a particular next hope

118
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:14,810
we want to look at four day we found

119
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:19,700
some here are the so some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> active</font>

120
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:24,950
responsive a SS so I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> open why</font>

121
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:30,200
they are affected or where a day here is

122
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:35,330
the SAS garage I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that most of them</font>

123
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:39,889
are located for a s hopped-up fear a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

124
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:43,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the s home and after I prepared to a</font>

125
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:48,590
certain amount they are located<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 5a s</font>

126
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:54,550
hope bl2 and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one transit a s</font>

127
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:54,549
which applied depending on this route

128
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:03,600
then we um count the number of a SS that

129
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,690
they have the brows with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> airspace</font>

130
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,210
like different s past links before I

131
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:11,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">prepare and after preparing to a certain</font>

132
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:15,719
amount and they change that you use the

133
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:19,290
Browse be out too we can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

134
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:23,370
rouse vol.1 has the<font color="#CCCCCC"> propellant length of</font>

135
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:28,550
four and rouse be out you have to

136
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:32,370
prepare<font color="#E5E5E5"> on of the a space lanes with six</font>

137
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:36,719
so there is this is the number of a SS

138
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:40,710
that they received rouse with real

139
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,710
different lines and they have the base

140
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:48,510
path length of four and<font color="#CCCCCC"> six the means</font>

141
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:51,810
when I prepend up to three on l1 the

142
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:55,620
Esper's range of this browse would be

143
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:59,760
increased 37 it is greater than then the

144
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:02,100
route 302 which is sex so they will

145
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,240

155
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:40,500
so when will it change or what is both

00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">AAS pass there are one or out to have</font>

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,850
the same as path lines

158
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:52,660
and I try to illustrate these armed with

the equal to or greater than policy and

160
00:09:52,660 --> 00:10:00,019
when i classify them with these policies

161
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:03,319
I can explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> why there's a imbalanced a</font>

167
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:40,689

so

00:11:54,590 --> 00:12:02,020
they should be equal but this AAS hasn't

00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:52,540
yeah I collected some bgp updates on the

we are one and how to i didn't do any

this will also seems like 13

as you creep in

239
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,470
people go to one state but as you lose

some of the treatment

241
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:30,030
they don't go back to New it's

so

there multiple stable state
