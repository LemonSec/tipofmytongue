00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:06,109
alright so if you see PT cast my name is

Matt Levine cash networks / cash fly

3
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:10,769
I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> also be playing the role today of</font>

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,460
show up but he was actually the driving

15
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,440
first things first I know nobody wants

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,829
to be interactive but how many people

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,379
sell IP transit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network how much</font>

18
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:44,100
not that many<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how many of those</font>

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:47,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are any cast enabled right now no</font>

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,690
hands should have gone down any cast

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,160
from a network perspective is nothing

22
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">special as far as your routers are</font>

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,468
concerned it's just a route with

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,690
multiple next hops all the magic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

wherever you're delivering those packets

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,408
to but as far as network operators are

28
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:09,179
concerned any test is nothing it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

29
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,860
a prefix with next hops that is it so

30
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,960
the perceived problem that seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful if they know what you're doing</font>

it so any<font color="#E5E5E5"> cast is also very easy to</font>

70
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:48,709
proxy anything like you know HTTP proxy

<font color="#E5E5E5">servers about the same thing so a lot of</font>

72
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:54,319
my experience has been moving a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

73
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,970
people's HTTP traffic through proxy

74
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:01,429
servers and it works great customers are

75
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,160
isolated on virtual addresses that live

76
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:06,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">on a load balancer and that virtual</font>

77
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,349
address simply lives in every data

78
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:11,420
center that you you're operating on so

79
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:14,149
you know when you're you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

80
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,988
the network it's one block thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

81
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:19,730
customers and you know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

82
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,680
now why would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know use a</font>

83
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:25,578

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to relate that to http it</font>

85
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:36,380
works perfectly let's see so there's a

86
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:37,730
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP state and the reason</font>

87
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,410
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may want to use a proxy server</font>

88
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,268
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can accomplish state</font>

89
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,709
synchronization with an IP stacks of

90
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:45,370
multiple different types of operating

91
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:47,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">systems some of that's done custom and</font>

92
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,609
Matt will talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what they've</font>

93
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,970
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> with their load balancing</font>

94
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:58,040
mechanisms so we'll talk to that a

95
00:03:52,970 --> 00:04:00,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit more no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> geography so when you</font>

96
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,349
have good geographical separation

97
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:06,950
meaning north<font color="#E5E5E5"> south east west or US</font>

98
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:10,970
versus the UK massive failures tend to

99
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:12,798
not really disrupt anything because say

100
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,829
your traffic disrupts somewhere in

101
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,690
Nevada or somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the west coast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

103
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,589
pop in California the bits are still

104
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,940
going to go to that one pop they just

105
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:25,250
might be going there via a different

106
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,420
route if you have multiple pops in

107
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,450
California then the

108
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,790
chances<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you having your stuff you</font>

109

servers in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. chances are that's</font>

going to become a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you I</font>

115
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,930
added this that this little slide today

116
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,970
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> David</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> huberman we had a</font>

117
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,120
little discussion about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anycast</font>

118
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">might be wasteful to IP space</font>

119
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,620
specifically because people are using /

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 force as their service blocks for any</font>

121
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,360
cast so if you have one dns server and

122
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,270
you're going to any cast it you have to

123
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,310
use a whole / 24 1 / 32 out of that

124
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:17,359
block and to spread<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out and that</font>

125
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:21,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">seems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it pretty wasteful however when</font>

126
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,030
you're doing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like doll net has 30</font>

127
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,920
sites or<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know exactly how many</font>

128
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,900
but they have a lot of sites and they're

129
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,420
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> one block for all those sites</font>

130
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:32,750
rather than 30 separate blocks so for

131
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,540
them to maintain routing on their own it

132
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,010
would be much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive on the</font>

133
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,350
allocation side if they weren't using

134
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,810
any cast and if you're if you're

135
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,510
efficient and you really have a need for

136
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of IP spaces and I peas in that</font>

137
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,080
block for web surfing or what have you

138
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:53,030
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a waste it's actually quite</font>

139
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:55,359
efficient so carriers and peering for

140
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,580
content players having you you're

141
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,110
peering even is pretty important so if

142
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:06,260
you have for instance appeared with a

143
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:10,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">European</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network and say I will just say</font>

appearing with why and<font color="#CCCCCC"> where it changes</font>

151
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:32,840
it adds an extra dynamic to that so

152
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,849
having like a European transit provider

153
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,940
in the US also can cause problems like

<font color="#CCCCCC">that so if you're you're buying transit</font>

160
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:54,590
with European carrier X in London you

161
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,330
are better off not peering with them

162
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,590
anywhere else you do not want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to appear</font>

163
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,570
with them in ashburn you do not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

166
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,849
alternate path domestically so you want

167
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,960
it to fail over to your little transit

168
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,690
or something else you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want them to</font>

go oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> here with you in San Jose that's</font>

170
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:14,419
clearly the next best spot now that

171
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:15,889
London's gone yeah so when you're

172
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:19,909
appearing you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> really keep in mind</font>

173
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:22,520
that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pier might isolate you know your</font>

176
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:28,669
appear with them in other places you

you're any quest is going to go over

179
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:36,979
that period on and when you can do where

180
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:40,130
it makes sense you know think about it

181

184
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,389
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important to make sure that</font>

185
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,680
your peers and your transit providers

186
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:53,389
know what you're doing and have a proper

187
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,729
community set so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> something does go</font>

188
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:58,610
goofy you can massage<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and make sure</font>

00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so as a Content player what</font>

194
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,609
nearly as slowly as dns so it allows you

195
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,650
to shift traffic either intentionally or

196
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,050
unintentionally a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> faster than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

sort of dns based wide area load

198
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,570
balancing obviously it provides you

199
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,910
buffers for major failures due to that

200
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,610
convergence time so stuff might break

201
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:33,529
but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay your traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to</font>

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,440
traffic there's it is bgp and more

205
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:46,010
importantly it's bgp that you don't

206
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,630
control you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really putting the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onus</font>

207
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,790
on the people that are delivering you

208
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,880
the bits to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there I GP</font>

209
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,380
costs are in line with<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you expect</font>

for perform

211
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:59,209
and there's not much you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do about it</font>

212
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,610
if it's not now that said when that

213
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:03,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">occurs there's obviously a huge</font>

214
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,920
performance upside to delivering packets

215
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:09,079
at closer locations either topologically

216
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,329
or geographically or in a perfect world

217
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:12,800
both which allows you to boost the

218
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:16,189
performance of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your application also</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with HTTP there's a significant cost</font>

222
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:27,439
your site that kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you end</font>

223
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:31,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">up if you look at a lot of sites out</font>

224
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,130
there I require six or even more dns

225
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,570
lookups to acquire the content so when

226
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,620
you're using any cats that trims that

227
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,810
down quite significantly and the other

228
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,660
neat thing about it is it gives you a

229
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,670
simple ability to write tools around it

230
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,050
so you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> write interesting Perl</font>

231
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,079
scripts or whatever it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you like</font>

238
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,300

239
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:10,670
you know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people crashing zones and</font>

240
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:14,149
weird TTL issues and people doing

241
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:15,649
non-standard things with DNS so what we

242
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:19,190
did is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> collected a bunch of data from</font>

243
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:21,920
a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> different sources for may not so</font>

244
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,440
Renesys provided bgp data and in our

245
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,589
case what we do is we track which pop

246
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,170
somebody is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to as in each pop the</font>

247
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:32,209
load<font color="#E5E5E5"> bouncer or the BGP speaker puts</font>

248
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,219
their own IP is the atomic aggregator so

249
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:38,209
we can look at both<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s path changes and</font>

250
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,190
actual pop changes we use keynote to

251
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:43,459
actually monitor TCP availability as

252
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,260
short live sessions and compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

253
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:49,760
the keynote business 40 for better<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:52,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">worse and revision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 was nice enough J</font>

255
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Adelson's company to let us share their</font>

256
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,149
data so may knife was a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular</font>

257
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,130
day for them they released a new video

258
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:00,529
which they do every week but worked out

259
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,939
too we<font color="#E5E5E5"> measured over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 terabytes of</font>

260
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:04,390
transfer so a fair chunk of data

261
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,649
delivered over TCP anycast for the day

262
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:11,649
so Renesys

263
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:14,420
for the day they saw 130<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp updates</font>

264
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:16,040
that is considered for them a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> low</font>

265
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:20,479
volume of updates given the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

266
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:23,300
PGP feeds they have we did see 34 pop

267
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,339
changes which for us is a pretty big

268
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,599
number for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a given day and we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to</font>

269
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:30,230
that in a second we can attribute them

270
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,179
mostly to one event like I said hundred

271
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,059
and thirty updates pretty stable prefix

272
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:37,579
as far as Renesys is concerned so we had

273
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:41,029
an event in San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jose that was an</font>

274
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:43,699
upstream event that generated 98 updates

275
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:47,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of 130 for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the day but in this about</font>

276
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:50,709
40 minute period and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 actual</font>

277
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:54,439
pop changes during that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 35 minute window</font>

278
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:56,479
that is single changes so that went from

279
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:59,480
San Jose to Chicago then back to San

280
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:05,449
Jose we said one change so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

281
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:07,069
a failover and fell back unfortunately

282
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:09,649
we actually couldn't match that up to

283
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:11,779
any of the traffic changes that happened

284
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:15,679
I think there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reasons for</font>

285
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:19,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">that first most of the BGP speakers that</font>

286
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:23,269
we did see seem to be european and asian

287
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:26,508
carriers reporting their domestic paths

288
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:29,569
to Renesys thankfully most of those

289
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:32,660

Amsterdam respectively so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I one</font>

291
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,749
possibility and it is a big question

292
00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:37,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">mark in my mind but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one possibility is</font>

293
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:42,079
that there just<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't a lot of people</font>

294
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:45,378
<font color="#E5E5E5">using those routes and number two is we</font>

295
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:47,899
don't have a big enough sample size we

296
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:49,670
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a company if our</font>

prefix is reachable to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet at</font>

298
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,790
all times we care<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's reachable to</font>

299
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:55,399
the people who are requesting our

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,980
content at all times and<font color="#CCCCCC"> often times</font>

301
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,019
those numbers differ by quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit as</font>

302
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,579
far as what prefixes are generating

303
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:05,059
request<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus where we are unreachable</font>

304
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:06,199
when these things happen the other

305
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:09,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting thing during these events</font>

306
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:13,339
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> average time between San Jose to</font>

307
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:16,309
Chicago back to San Jose was about 20

308
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:17,899
seconds which also seemed very high to

309
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:19,620
me so whatever event happened was very

310
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:21,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">very quick on the trigger</font>

311
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to co to go back to San Jose but that's</font>

312
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,040
still enough if you're not sharing state

313
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:30,060
to break all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your TCP sessions that</font>

314
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:32,339
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on at that time but for the</font>

315
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,779
most part bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems stable so then we</font>

316
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,540
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay keynote tell us is TCP</font>

317
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:40,680
actually stable and evidently it's not

318
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,900
yeah so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kidding so what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did with</font>

319
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,459
keynote they did 31 locations each

320
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,640
location pulled once every five minutes

321
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,660
so about<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> poll every 10 seconds and</font>

322
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,699
compared at compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> that against</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

323
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,699
keynote business 40 which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just their</font>

324
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,050
index of business like pages<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess on</font>

325
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,540
the same sample period that we used for

326
00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:01,050
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP data and for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP data I</font>

327
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,610
don't know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to show up the</font>

328
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">green line is the anycast measurement</font>

329
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,980
and the orange line is the keynote

330
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:11,370
business 40 so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at stability</font>

331
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,140
we pegged 100% stability this is the

332
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom graph it on the bottom graph so</font>

333
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,460
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to see the line and on</font>

334
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,470
the top graph our latency time to load

335
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:23,100
the data was lower than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> average</font>

336
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:26,490
business 40 I was a 30 kilobyte file

337
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,050
that each one requested so I think the

338
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,940
average latency for the day to do the

339
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:32,099
request was like 1.5<font color="#CCCCCC"> hour point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 15</font>

340
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,959
seconds 150<font color="#E5E5E5"> millisecond so you can do</font>

341
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the math on what keynote perceived the</font>

342
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:38,579
actual download performance to be during

343
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the period and finally we have the</font>

344
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,860
revision<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 data so we looked at all the</font>

345
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,410
downloads for the day it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was isolated to</font>

346
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:50,790
a specific VIP and what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we had</font>

347
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:53,310
a span port basically looking at TCP

348
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,560
sessions that started at a pop that did

349
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">not begin with sim which is very</font>

350
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,680
indicative of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> session that was started</font>

351
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:01,529
somewhere else to that destination IP

352
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,880
and all of a sudden switched over and

353
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:04,439
what we have we have a global state

354
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,700
table so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually all the load</font>

355
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,589
balancers talk to all the other load

356
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,779
balancers every five or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 seconds or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

357
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:11,880
and they know what source and

358
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:14,430
destination port are destined to what

359
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,290
pop and they actually in the event that

360
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:17,640
we do failover they actually do some

361
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:21,390
magical things and get it back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

362
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:24,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">right web server so we compared sessions</font>

363
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,170
that appeared out of nowhere to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

364
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,300
intelligence<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had about where the</font>

365
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:30,030
sessions were to begin with and we

366
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,180
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure long live data so for</font>

367
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:36,410
the day they had cry

368
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,729
mately 685,000 tcp sessions for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day</font>

369
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,430
we threw out anything less than 10

370
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,050
minutes so all tcp sessions that lasted

371
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:45,030
less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's that data went away</font>

372
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,189
leaving us with<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 25,000</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

373
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:48,030
sessions which lasted longer than 10

374
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,010
minutes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can kind of see the</font>

375
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:53,310
distribution on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the graph of the number</font>

00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:54,960
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sessions is the y axis and the</font>

377
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,630
minutes the length<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the TCP session is</font>

00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> X and you can kind of see it's kind</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of distribution I would have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> expected</font>

380
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,760
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking I think the average file</font>

381
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:07,980
size today<font color="#E5E5E5"> was about 300 megabytes and</font>

382
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:12,360
we observed a total of four<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP sessions</font>

383
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:15,600
move between pops which works out a

384
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,610
failure rate including the first 685,000

385
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,970
number two point zero zero zero six

386
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:25,680
percent and for the long sessions point

387
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:28,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero one seven percent i would say in my</font>

388
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,130
experience it's tough to say that's any

389
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,210
different than what we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have seen</font>

390
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:34,320
delivering a unicast service and

391
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,760
moreover it doesn't deal with total

392
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,260
failure rates they're all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font>

393
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,600
ways things could have failed that would

394
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,700
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar to unicast we were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

395
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,800
looking at things where session started

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">inside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a magically appeared in sight</font>

397
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,050
beat and keep in mind if you keep state

398
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:51,840
that percentage is actually 0 yeah in

399
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,579
our case we dropped<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 of those but if</font>

400
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,780
you had something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> knew nothing</font>

401
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,460
about any case you're just deploying

402
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,920
random TCP service it's got long live

403
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:02,840
sessions you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have dropped four out</font>

404
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,770
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24,000 if you had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same source</font>

405
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,930
prefixes sending you the traffic in the

406
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:10,200
same carriers that this particular

407
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:13,080
customer had some networks are more

408
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,520
stable some networks are less stable so

409
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,230
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of gotchas when it</font>

410
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,980
comes to deploying an innie cast<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup</font>

411
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:23,880
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> large scale changes on the provider</font>

412
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:25,860
level really can impact your traffic so

413
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,870
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do have to pay attention to that and</font>

414
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:29,610
figure out okay what did somebody change

415
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:32,879
their community that's no longer

416
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:35,340
available that was you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know am I leaking</font>

417
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,880
to something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I shouldn't be and</font>

418
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:44,730
then things that are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad get much</font>

419
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,590
worse so you could there was a insurance

420
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">company based out of Phoenix</font>

421
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:51,658
that was having some definite issues

422
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:53,250
reaching our content and through the

423
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:54,870
course of talking to the right people I

424
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,059
figured finally gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the guy in</font>

425
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,309
charge of the network and that very

426
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:01,320
strict requirements they needed to t

427
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:03,750
ones from their carrier and each one

428
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,059
needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a different pop the</font>

429
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,360
carrier in question was sprint and one

430
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:10,350
pop was Anaheim and one pop was Dallas

431
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,969
and they fought per packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> load</font>

432
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">balancing would be a very good idea to</font>

433
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:19,429
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best performance out of there to</font>

434
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:23,220
t1 links that doesn't work with any cast

435
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:25,350
what happens is say first packet goes

436
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,419
out east first / second packet goes out

437
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,789
west eventually one side gets really fed

438
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:31,230
up and sends a reset<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're</font>

439
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:32,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking you're sending packets there</font>

440
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,080
that it has no idea what it's talking

441
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,149
about and in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> case it's before our</font>

442
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,010
global state change stable converges

443
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:39,779
because it's during the initial setup

444
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:43,169
whether we're seeing these packets occur

445
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:46,919
in pop a and<font color="#E5E5E5"> poppy it's not 20</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes</font>

446
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:50,250
later into it it's since an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ack-ack does</font>

447
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:52,080
not work nor would I expect they saw

448
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,730
very good performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> in general to any</font>

449
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,949
unicast prefix using this methodology

450
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,929
just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP would not have been</font>

451
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:02,390
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy with the jumps with the</font>

452
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:06,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">round-trip time so here's our conclusion</font>

453
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:09,510
in our experience utilizing<font color="#E5E5E5"> any cast you</font>

454
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's it's not any less unstable</font>

455
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,390
than it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good it's a</font>

456
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,460
wonderful way to manage your traffic and

457
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:20,070
if you're able to dedicate the right

458
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:24,720
resource to it and the right management

459
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:30,678
to it it will make deploying HTTP and

460
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:33,419
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP apps much much more robust and</font>

461
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,250
you know there's well yeah I mean if you

462
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:37,500
this we've all looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean there's</font>

463
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:40,230
a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people always say TCB</font>

464
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,669
anycast doesn't work and the answer is

465
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:46,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people publish data that supports</font>

466
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:48,360
that theory and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really sure</font>

467
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,760
what the differences that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it not</font>

468
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,789
necessarily seem as stable in a

469
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,929
typically measured environment it'd be

470
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:55,860
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see I know there's other</font>

471
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:59,010
companies here who<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily</font>

472
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,240
talk about it the doodoo TCP anycast you

473
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,530
know I can count on

474
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,320
fingers that you know the companies that

475
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:06,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">I share my data with but it would be</font>

476
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,010

477

478
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:13,170
past saying don't run TCP anycast it

479
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,130
would have been interesting if they

480
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,929
could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> published the failure rate</font>

481
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,809
for people that query the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD servers</font>

482
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:22,140
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP how often their actual traffic</font>

483
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:23,670
fail because you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our</font>

484
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,530
perspective we are looking at our actual

00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:28,620
traffic what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a daily basis</font>

486
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:30,600
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> verisign said well you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know we saw</font>

487
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,939
traffic changing so you shouldn't use

488
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,199
TCP but I would have liked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see and I</font>

489
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,510
like to see other people share more data

490
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,580
where they say here's where our<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

491
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,350
breaks because we do have it deployed

492
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:45,870
and this is what we've had to do to go

493
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:49,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">around it and yeah just trust us it</font>

494
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:51,419
works and you know widespread failures

495
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,610
we're going to cause some problems for

496
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:57,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you but as long as the internet stays</font>

497
00:20:53,610 --> 00:21:03,600
fairly stable and it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't</font>

498
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:06,750
happen too often yeah so ipv6 I cash

499
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:11,870
like we do have a plan the remote works

500
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,870
uh and the plan we just hope we're dead

501
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,440
so what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do first if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

502
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,449
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't work and you</font>

503
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,559
haven't tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yourself don't tell</font>

504
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,419
other people you know that it doesn't

505
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:30,090
work because it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> frustrating</font>

506
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:31,650
when people say oh I heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> from some guy</font>

507
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,168
who read some report that some guy

508
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,580
published based on some guys data that

509
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:38,610
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work so don't even</font>

510
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,470
think about running it moreover if your

511
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:42,330
application doesn't handle TCP failures

512
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,669
well I would not recommend deploying it

513
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,590
on the internet because you can't expect

514
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:49,110
that your packets will get dropped

515
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:50,399
somewhere at some time and if your

516
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,689
application doesn't support that you're

517
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:54,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have problems regardless of how</font>

518
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,929
you deployed so smtp works well because

519
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:00,270
it has some internal recovery mechanisms

520
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:03,330
HTTP works fine if you break an image

521
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:06,330
people are used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and people also</font>

522
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:08,789
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of browsers support resets so if</font>

523
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:11,070
reset hits the browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> will retry so in</font>

524
00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:13,740
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of cases it won't even impact the</font>

525
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:15,899
browser and we suggest that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

526
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,919
experiment with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and then</font>

527
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:21,870
collaborate and share your experiences

528
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,149
any questions questions start over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

529
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,799
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Hasse words verisign I'm</font>

530
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:28,969
actually one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those guys who did one</font>

531
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:31,740
of those presentations I think it's

532
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,120
there's two comments one is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

533
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,520
dependent on the client base that you're

534
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,820
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and our client base was</font>

535
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,649
very far flung looking at j root and a

536
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,750
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we saw were from</font>

537
00:22:40,649 --> 00:22:44,580
far reaches of the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there</font>

538
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:47,460
was definitely per packet load balancing

539
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:49,168
sort of issues going on there so that

540
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,360
caused a lot of state changes between

541
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:55,350
the two and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's a question</font>

542
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">of how big your clientele do you you</font>

543
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:00,209
want to reach at all times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do you</font>

544
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,220
just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to worry about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well-connected</font>

545
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,289
spots or places that aren't as well

00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,120
connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> that may have some sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

547
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:08,850
brain damage sort of connectivity going

548
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,770
on between and in our case<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font>

549
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">reach places where our customers pass</font>

550
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:15,270
money to deliver things do so so it

551
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds like you've carefully engineered</font>

552
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:19,710
your your your your network to do the

553
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,149
right thing yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know for our</font>

554
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,649
business case it wasn't a question of

555
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,090
hey let's deploy it and if stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> drops</font>

556
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:25,830
you know we'll deal with it we actually

557
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:27,149
had to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time to you know to meet</font>

558
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,119
the SLA is that we provide our customers

559
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:31,738
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so in that sense it makes sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

560
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:34,049
there's there's cases if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just put</font>

561
00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:36,149
these sites out willy-nilly and and

562
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:38,249
you're trying to have global one hundred

563
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:40,799
percent connectivity where it works in

564
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:43,769
the unicast environment and um it

565
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,539
doesn't work all the time in a any caste

566

it's good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk on about the</font>

00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:06,119
this stuff um and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mark's point</font>

571
00:24:02,969 --> 00:24:09,569
is and your responses it's probably good

572
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:13,619
if you engineer it um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

573
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:15,599
applies to<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this but there's</font>

574
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:18,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">one point that I have a problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

575
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:21,319
which was that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to narrow</font>

576
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:24,329
peering and narrowing your topology and

577
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:28,079
I'd reflect back on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering part</font>

578
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:32,819
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are circumstances where that is</font>

579
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:37,408
exactly not true um and for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

580
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:41,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">deployment we did back in 96 the purpose</font>

581
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:45,599
was to shed traffic off our backbone we

582
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:50,789
didn't have we had to support<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

583
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:52,769
high traffic streaming<font color="#CCCCCC"> um program I</font>

584
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:55,589
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember what popular TV thingy</font>

585
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:58,439
they were streaming and so what we did

586
00:24:55,589 --> 00:25:01,769
is we tcp any tested it from all our

587
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:05,369
edges to our peers and that's the exact

588
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:08,519
opposite<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i think the point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

589
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:10,649
both to mark and two other people

590
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:14,579
thinking of deploying is you might

591
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:16,559
engineer it yeah to speak to that this

592
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:18,629
the talk we're giving is specifically

593
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,549
content that we were dealing with

594
00:25:18,629 --> 00:25:22,049
directly and we were engineering<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

595
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:25,079
network to deal with our particular

596
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:26,729
content and our clients<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs but you</font>

597
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:28,229
know in that case that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

598
00:25:26,729 --> 00:25:29,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">different engineering requirement and</font>

599
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:31,829
it's not to say that definitely to make

600
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:34,079
it work requires a lot of time a lot of

601
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:36,779
engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point was more</font>

602
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,789
that if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really not as bad</font>

603
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:40,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">as you might think it is and there's</font>

604
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:42,449
possibilities depending on what you're

605
00:25:40,229 --> 00:25:43,160
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the potential benefits of</font>

606
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:44,450
doing it

607
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,330
and the simplicity involved might

608
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,530
outweigh you know like I say if you're

609
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:51,530
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with an application that can</font>

610
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:53,180
tolerate unreachable ax t and deals with

611
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,820
the fact that from time to time IP

612
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:58,010
addresses can't be reached if that's am

613
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:01,639
here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cast is a really easy</font>

614
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:03,920
way to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting your feet wet as it</font>

615
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,290
were and distributing your services<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

616
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,590
more than one data center what do you so

617
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:12,800
over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past 10 or 12 years a bunch of</font>

618
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:16,820
us have all seen the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> result looking</font>

619
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:20,000
at long-lived<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP connections for</font>

620
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:21,800
content distribution that is we've seen

621
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,780
over and over this number of about a

622
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:31,330
hundredth of one percent right and marks

623
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:36,070
numbers with the the caterer sorry with

624
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:38,629
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> route je root we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

625
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:42,710
surprisingly different from that at the

626
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:45,050
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he released that and so i</font>

627
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,060
don't know i mean the methodology was

628
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:50,210
sound it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a different result and</font>

629
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:52,700
so it seems like maybe that might bear

630
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,170
some looking into at some point is why

631
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:58,280
it is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're seeing this sort of</font>

632
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:59,750
bimodal result what what I've been just

633
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,700
yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> randy's it also might</font>

634
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,230
have to do with purpose I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

635
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:07,310
my stated goal is a lot different than

636
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:09,800
capable exactly so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one one</font>

637
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:14,090
mode of result has been very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much this</font>

638
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:16,580
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of large file transfer right or</font>

639
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,470
streaming audio or whatever right which

640
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,899
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> effectively the same thing and the</font>

641
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:24,260
other has been a fairly different kind

642
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:25,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">of network that normally carries fairly</font>

643
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,920
different kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic so we might</font>

644
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:31,160
kind of take another look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some</font>

645
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:36,980
at some<font color="#E5E5E5"> point if it seems to hold up and</font>

646
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:40,550
it yeah and another<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

647
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:42,470
would be that dull net kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of runs very</font>

648
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:45,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">long live tcp sessions I mean some</font>

649
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,670
people go for months<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it be it seems</font>

650
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,080
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for them it would be an</font>

651
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,210
interesting thing to study how that

652
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,360
works and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're terribly</font>

653
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,690
picky about who they get

654
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,860
hands it from so if you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

655
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,320
functioning for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and they're</font>

656
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:01,889
succeeding with it so that would be

657
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,200
another good study to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that did</font>

658
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:09,570
Danny<font color="#CCCCCC"> McPherson again I I just wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

659
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:11,010
echo what I was standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font>

660
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,899
just wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> echo what randy said</font>

661
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,429
actually and many others like Hank and

662
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,960
others i talked to is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean 10</font>

663
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:18,600
years ago people were using this to game

664
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,370
you know keynote for the same reason you

665
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,260
know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know for tcp based</font>

666
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,909
transactions for 10k filing a web server

667
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,710
lots of ingress points in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

668
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,179
and you know there was significant you

669
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,070
know improvements<font color="#CCCCCC"> in response times</font>

670
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,690
because it's all propagation delay or

671
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:33,210
round trip time related or however you

672
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:35,040
want to look at it but so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

673
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,450
the one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know you know so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

674
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,580
think anybody can test that other<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

675
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,780
maybe one published thing but then the

676
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">other part is i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are a</font>

677
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:44,010
lot of implications on things like

678
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,350
origin ASR announcing a prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

679
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:47,879
multiple places and even though folds

680
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,649
into some of the security aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

681
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,730
prefix hijacking you know and some of

682
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,110
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things that this helps</font>

683
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:55,429
complicate and so those need to be

684
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:58,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">considered as well as the as well as the</font>

685
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:59,730
the state between different servers

686
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:01,020
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i suspected some of this</font>

687
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,610
might might include is how you

688
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,530
synchronize some of the state between

689
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:06,330
servers or content and you know how you

690
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:08,250
deal with the fellow vers if a process

691
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,139
dies inside of that just just as with

692
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">dns or something like that so that's all</font>

693
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">i wanted to yes certainly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

694
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,870
presentation could last a lot longer and

695
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,809
covered a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more detail this was more</font>

696
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">just an introduction of hey it's really</font>

697
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:21,080
not as scary as everybody thinks if

698
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,100
everybody started playing with it

699
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,449
perhaps we have more data points that

700
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,159
can use to learn more about my things

701
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,990
behave way they do and some innovation

702
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,760
can happen out of that some open source

703
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:34,169
state synchronization tools things like

704
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:36,080
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pretty fantastic Michael</font>

705
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:39,030
Sinatra UC Berkeley I agree that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

706
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:42,590
nice to see more empirical studies like

707
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:45,299
this thanks for doing that I wanted to

708
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:46,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">say a little bit about the at the very</font>

709
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:50,490
end of the presentation you did say that

710
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:54,299
you not all protocols not all

711
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:56,429
applications can handle this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

712
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:58,590
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful about saying than</font>

713
00:29:56,429 --> 00:30:00,419
generalizing because your presentation

714
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:02,428
does say TCP and I'd be careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

715
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:04,530
generalizing that tall<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pc pc me would</font>

716
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:05,100
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little more careful about how you</font>

717
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,660
present

718
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,330
right off the bat instead of throwing

719
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:11,220
that in at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end when we were seeing</font>

720
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:14,070
protocol we meant<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know four through</font>

721
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:16,710
seven kind of protocol yeah as a

722
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:18,570
transport we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP works great the</font>

723
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is what does your application</font>

724
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:22,820
do when the transport goes away the

725
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">other one other thing I want to say is</font>

726
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,178
part of the reason I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think people object</font>

727
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:30,750
to this is that the you know TCP

728
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:32,250
protocol does provide ways of dealing

729
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">with out of order packets the idea being</font>

730
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,160
that packets may not always take the

731
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,159
same path because the protocol allows

732
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:40,260
for that it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to do that in</font>

733
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,240
their routing and we don't know when or

734
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,679
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will happen if not many</font>

735
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,720
people today are doing per packet load

736
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,730
balancing or traffic sharing on their

737
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,049
links maybe they will start maybe a new

738
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,159
implementation will come out or a new

739
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:52,200
router vendor will start making that

740
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">third default you just don't know what's</font>

741
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,780
going to happen so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do have to be</font>

742
00:30:53,429 --> 00:31:00,150
very careful with this sort of thing and

743
00:30:54,780 --> 00:31:02,190
watch out for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yeah Matt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Peterson</font>

744
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:04,380
two quick questions here the first is

745
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you mentioned this I think the first</font>

746
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,520
slide was a high definition adult

747
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,070
content can you kind of give a

748
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,379
description of the size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the files</font>

749
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:16,980
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're comparison data which i</font>

750
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,419
assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> of highly compressed podcast or</font>

751
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,090
video that's quite a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different than</font>

752
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:23,760
something like HDTV quality video files

753
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:25,678
and the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is the state</font>

754
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,299
mechanisms you mentioned open source are

755
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,190
you currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a commercial product</font>

756
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:30,510
or if you hack something together open

757
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:33,390
source and you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to extend that</font>

758
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:35,460
sure as far as the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself that</font>

759
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,299
we measured it was actually a mix of a

760
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,730
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different compression</font>

761
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:40,590
algorithms I forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they publishing</font>

762
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,880
to be perfectly honest you can go to

763
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,389
revision 3.com and look at any other

764
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">shows you can see what they use but</font>

765
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:51,030
average file size like I say was about

766
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:52,890
350 they have some that are about 200

767
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,850
the small format stuff and I do have

768
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:56,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">files they go all the way up to about</font>

769
00:31:53,850 --> 00:32:00,059
650 700 megabytes so it's kind of in the

770
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,919
range of<font color="#E5E5E5"> there as far as what we do for</font>

771
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:05,750
state we kind of hacked it together

772
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:08,520
ourselves it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's</font>

773
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:09,900
we wouldn't necessarily go out and go

774
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,270
out of our way to publish we'd probably

775
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:16,380
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more interested in supporting some</font>

776
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:17,879
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more open source something that</font>

777
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,840
was more community or grassroots based

778
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,670
and go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and put some</font>

779
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,439
behind that that necessarily release our

780
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:24,600
code but it's definitely something we

781
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,700
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support so that more and more</font>

782
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">people can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of play in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the arena as</font>

it were hi Nathan Patrick from<font color="#E5E5E5"> sonic</font>

dryer I'm sorry we're already late so

785
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:36,330
I'll need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this off ahead of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">course tried to close lines at least if</font>

787
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:40,939
you have more questions please talk to

788
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,940
them offline or sure they'll be around
