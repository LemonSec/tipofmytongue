the optics is a pluggable and there is

test equipment that you need to have and

148
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:33,229
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next the important thing</font>

149
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,970
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what happens if the engineers</font>

150
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:37,430
that developed the system and tested the

151
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:42,380
system gets hit by bus who is going to

152
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:46,250
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to maintain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the system there are</font>

153
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,960
some exotic options that I'm not going

154
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,990
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about it may be a fully fusion</font>

155
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,359
nano top the bottom line so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can have</font>

156
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">a two gigabit system of a dark fiber for</font>

157
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,660
about a thousand dollars you can have a

158
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,700
ticketing system for between five and

159
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,400
ten thousand dollars and similarly for

160
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:05,420
20 gigabit system if you're doing a 10

161
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:09,440
gig the 10 gig will scale very linearly

162
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:11,930
to multiple tanking channels and each of

163
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,460
those is about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times less</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

164
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:20,080
commercial<font color="#CCCCCC"> Siena or mobile system this</font>

165
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a vendor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have used in our</font>

166
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,479
system in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our network so if you are</font>

167
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,670
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to re-implement what what we did</font>

168
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:34,600
you we can you suggest that you can use

169
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:34,600
that so any questions

170
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,190
mike says what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do for timing I</font>

171
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:43,750
didn't you didn't mention like bits

172
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,940
clock or any kind of timing and i'm not

173
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:49,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure i know you need it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just didn't</font>

174
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">see it up there diamond yeah network</font>

175
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:52,600
timing don't you have the time I know

176
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,130
there is no need for timing because each

177
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,850
of the channel is completely separate

178
00:08:54,130 --> 00:09:01,990
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a jig so there is no</font>

179
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:03,459
specific dynamic needed to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> this mike</font>

180
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:07,000
hughes from links we have some

181
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:08,439
experience of network in this way one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things to particularly look at if</font>

183
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're trying to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> w WD m</font>

184
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:18,430
or go bidirectional on<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to fiber is</font>

185
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:21,370
to look out for back reflections um we

186
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,140
had a system that was based on running

187
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,850
by dat several channels bidirectional

188
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,890
over single fiber and what would happen

189
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,779
is the transceiver at one end would see

190
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,829
itself reflected back<font color="#CCCCCC"> of itself and the</font>

191
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:31,390
glare link up you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be very</font>

192
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:32,859
careful with isolation and your

193
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:35,529
components to stop that<font color="#E5E5E5"> reflexology</font>

194
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:38,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've had this problem the answer is I</font>

195
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:43,649
don't run two wavelengths and

196
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:47,110
bidirectional so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do that</font>

197
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:50,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can do that using circulators but</font>

198
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:53,170
that is kind of again it is possible and

199
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would love to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it but the</font>

200
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,620
other time
