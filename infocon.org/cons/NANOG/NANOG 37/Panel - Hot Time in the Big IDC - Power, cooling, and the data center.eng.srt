1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,730
real estate is very expensive that makes

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:09,059
sense however most of the data center

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:11,219
that we have in the United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we</font>

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,000
have it in like in a somewhat suburban

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:18,080
area so the real estate<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not as high</font>

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">too cool that place servers for instance</font>

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,180
takes about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3000 watt per per blade</font>

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,849
servers and that is if you put about

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:32,009
three or four<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those you can you can</font>

10
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:34,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">get up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there 10kw 12 15</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kW rapidly to</font>

11
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,690
cool that and with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,059
infrastructure it's almost impossible to

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,459
call that so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next step is we're</font>

14
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,589
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to bring a chilled water</font>

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,450
system to call that cabinet which a lot

16
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,020
of the vendors are starting to go to

17
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,059
their route so it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very difficult</font>

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,440
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us because when you start using a</font>

19
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,550
chilled water system in an open

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:02,120
colocation space and you mix up with the

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:04,890
other other colocation low density power

22
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,080
cabinets it's very hard to mix it up so

23
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,369
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually take I have a</font>

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,710
chilled water plane tonight you take

25
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,210
chilled water put it through coils in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

26
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,130
individual cabinet have a fan running

27
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,039
that's correct so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

28
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,810
recycle within the cabinet so so when

29
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,049
you have a coil it's probably you know

30
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,049
it's going to sit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back back to</font>

31
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:27,119
the heat the hot<font color="#E5E5E5"> aisle mm-hmm the back</font>

32
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,970
side of the cabinet so all the heat will

33
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,860
go through that coil and then recycle it

34
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,090
back to the front side so in order to do

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,610
that you have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really an</font>

36
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,439
enclosed space if you do that an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

37
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,860
space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you mix it with the other air</font>

38
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,139
it does not is not an efficient<font color="#CCCCCC"> system</font>

39
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">or are you you guys concerned at all</font>

40
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,790
about having lots of water flowing

41
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">around and through well of it this</font>

42
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,799
equipments day 20 years ago when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

43
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,329
working on a lot of the IBM facility

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,090
they used to have all this chilled water

45
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,429
system and nobody wanted that chilled

46
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,880
water into in their racks and cabinets

47
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,799
but as the technology's changing like

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,478
what he said going to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers and</font>

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,400
we can get up to 20 kW / cabinet that's

50
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely an issue and we have no way</font>

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">up okay I</font>

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,238
I would disagree you up no way out what

53
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:25,550
I'm actually disagree that you you have

54
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:28,470
no way out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are okay is that better</font>

55
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,860
okay i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually disagree there are</font>

56
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,060
several ways of doing that using

57
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,459
different facilities and also sort of

58
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,890
changing how you look at the delivery<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

59
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:40,319
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> air and also the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question that i</font>

60
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:44,940
would ask is how thermally efficient are

61
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,679
those rooms in the first place I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

62
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,690
love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring you on a tour of some of</font>

63
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,489
our data centers and we'll let<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sweat</font>

64
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,170
behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> some servers for a while oh no I</font>

65
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:54,840
understand that the servers are running

66
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,720
hot i'm not i'm not denying that what

67
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,160
I'm saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is that if you walk into</font>

68
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,220
most customer data centers I've been

69
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,510
into which is in the hundreds most of

70
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,329
time there may be only operating at

71
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,160
about seventy percent efficiency of the

72
00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:10,620
area that they have capacity to actually

73
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,780
deliver if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got tile cutouts in</font>

74
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,720
the back of a server where you've got

75
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,850
cables and that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> four foot you know</font>

76
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,950
four inch by 8 inch opening you're

77
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,319
losing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> air there as opposed to</font>

78
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,929
using something like closed cell foam

79
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,399
using something like a bristle system to

80
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,720
don't allow that air to escape so you're

81
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,280
actually getting more volume at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

88
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,530
I've got guys with you know you know

89
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,899
several GS ours in their space you know

90
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:49,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty junipers tons of server Sun boxes</font>

HP<font color="#CCCCCC"> boxes IBM z800 blades every wacky</font>

92
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,160
thing you can imagine and every

93
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,410
engineering religion you can imagine to

94
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,880
try and engineer and and do the cooling

95
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,290
on that with all these variables it's

96
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,660
it's it's almost impossible and it's a

97
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,250
rack environment up to several thousand

98
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,170
square feet and some you know carriers

99
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,549
drawing average of you know 40 watts of

100
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,349
square foot we love them we hug them we

101
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,849
kiss them they're great and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

102
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:10,380
these you know hosting guy comes in and

103
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,540
they you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do 400 watts</font>

104
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,650
a square foot and and we blink at them

105
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,630
and say no and they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're crazy</font>

106
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,269
and then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spread them out and</font>

107
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,289
do all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of crazy stuff it's it's a</font>

108
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:21,899
really difficult thing we're facing

109
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:24,210
right now and you know most of us are

110
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,919
pushing it to the limit but it's

111
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,150
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> they all have to face I can</font>

112
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,590
tell you one thing by the way in

113
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,000
regressing we were back on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

114
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,609
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say something will welcome</font>

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,020
liquid cooling I call<font color="#E5E5E5"> dielectric spray</font>

116
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,759
liquid on<font color="#E5E5E5"> chips whatever it takes</font>

117
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,680
because I in my opinion it's not about

118
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,690
power I think we can all get the power

119
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,039
in from the utilities now most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us put</font>

120
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,719
our data centers generally in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

121
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,659
locations to get those you know the big

122
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">13</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to feeds or whatever in from utility</font>

123
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:50,550
the issue is moving air or somehow

124
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,430
getting that stuff cool down and either

125
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,900
we vent it out or liquids or whatever

126
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,120
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's the issue it's really</font>

127
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,820
more cooling oh no cooling is definitely

128
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,470
the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem the issue that that</font>

129
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,820
I would raise is one of the problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

130
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">how you're thinking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the space and</font>

131
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,419
that is that you're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

132
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,979
watts per square foot as opposed to

133
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,359
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it in the specific</font>

134
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,340
requirements of the rack which is what

135
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,840
it eventually boils down to anyway and

136
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,060
if you have a method of doing that at

137
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,219
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mechanism by which you</font>

138
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,630
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> charge the customer based</font>

139
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:23,430
on the amount of heat<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font>

140
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:25,199
generating I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what you've</font>

141
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,419
done is you've lowered the cost to the

142
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,570
port to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer but then you've</font>

143
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:33,000
driven the cost of us has the IDC

144
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,710

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,150
either bigger space on charging for

147
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,190
other services but if you can

148
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,260
rationalize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to them that's actually</font>

149
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,570
allowing you to make the same if not

150
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:49,050
more money right yeah it's a thing is

151
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,610
when you have like 20 kW 15 KW / cabinet

152
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,770
you try to cool their with a current

153
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,750
infrastructure and even if you open up

154
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:57,870
that tile underneath you can only bring

155
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,550
so many CFM per tile there's no way you

156
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,949
can call that<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless you go with the</font>

157
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,830

158
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:06,780
I actually would disagree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">can also do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that by taking is one of the</font>

160
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,840
biggest problems we have with air

161
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,760
cooling is at some point within the

162
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,650
height of that rack what ends up

163
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,180
happening is the air basically bleeds

164
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,400
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> your generating so much air</font>

165
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,659

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,948
the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the top of the rack</font>

167
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:22,710
depending on where you initially

168
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:24,120
delivering the air that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the machines at</font>

169
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,180
either end of that spectrum are getting

170
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,979
basically they're not getting any air so

171
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,570
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually considered using air</font>

172
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,219
systems to actually go from the bottom

187
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:07,450
do some questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the audience</font>

Randy um grande bouche i J I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

189
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:17,110
put as hot stuffy in there as I can cool

190
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:21,610
because I want the power that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> life ok</font>

191
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:25,540
now the problems the cooling over three

192
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:28,420
four thousand KW per square meter with

193
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,400
current air cooling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're at the limit</font>

194
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:34,660
because people walking into the pop will

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,239
get blown over physically the wind

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have dry actions frankly surgeons how</font>

201
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,980
many folks here well we want dry action

202
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:59,230
cooling yeah how many folks here would

203
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,150
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to have water flowing through</font>

00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,350
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> racks come on everybody</font>

205
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,760
participate who would be willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

206
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,290
water flowing through the racks how many

207
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">people here would say that's a</font>

00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">deal-breaker for me to have water</font>

209
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,380
flowing through my racks I think the

210
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,120
people who said yes have water on their

211
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:17,050
brains yeah well<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright what about</font>

212
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,260
glycol look every scared of that what

214
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:26,650
there's better ways to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> airflow</font>

215
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:29,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">through the rack ok you can side feed</font>

216
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,179
them and blow across them etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

217
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:34,930
to sacrifice the square feet no matter

218
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:37,900
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok but the fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that most of</font>

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:52,360
unrealistic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

part of the hottest customer out there

232
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,030
kudos on this where they have one

233
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,950
cabinet are several cabinets running

234
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,300
about 386 watts of square foot at

235
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:32,050
seventy-five percent breaker load all

236
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:34,270
day long and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I can cool that</font>

237
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,910
they have a very big hot aisle behind

238
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,800
them and so they're spaced out and

239
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,270
they're around a lot of carriers who are

240
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,949
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> at about 40 watts of square foot</font>

241
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,829
which is wonderful and great that's the

242
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,910
only reason we can do it I think Patrick

243
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,250
Gilmore told me before that we're

raise the plenum higher and start

know going for in 2007 it takes about

close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know close to year and a</font>

half

271
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:13,399
get a start on it is about one a cabinet

272
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:15,859
is 2 square<font color="#E5E5E5"> meters essentially because</font>

273
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:25,399
you have to walk down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the aisle so</font>

274
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:27,259
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2kw so anyways so he's going</font>

275
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,110
forward with building that<font color="#E5E5E5"> day listen</font>

276
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:34,339
and going for we actually are starting

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:37,300
to separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-density users medium</font>

279
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,269
that's what we're going forward I and I

280
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:42,529
i think that's that's a wave of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,170
foot 2500 per square foot if we were

delivering the same cabinet space that

2,000 per cabinet 2,000 watts per

figure out a way to keep up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with us then</font>

341
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,069
I think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also keep the space</font>

00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,880
give ourselves another percentile to of

net gain a little business happening

345
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,080
here you know building from 100 and 100

346
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,570
watts square foot so what most everybody

347
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,800
built around 2000 2001 and yeah great

348
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,090
we're spreading down cannibalizing

349
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,339
getting to 200 watts of square foot or

350
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:09,020
more is great but when you when you

351
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,790
start saying i want to go to 200 watts<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

352
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,990
square foot baseline or 400 watts of

00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,120
square foot baseline it's not a linear

354

curve it doesn't just you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just oh</font>

355
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,040
we just tack on some<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> costs its</font>

356
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,360
exponential it's it's obscene I all

357
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,250
kinds of new technologies have to put in

358
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,320
place massive generators oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> and by the</font>

359
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,030
way it's a fun thing generator lead time

360
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,300
right now for a nice 2 megawatt diesel

361
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:31,490
engine it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a year up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a year</font>

362
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,140
for one generator so we can build all

00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,910
those raised floor or non raised floor

364
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,380
do all the overhead get all waiting and

365
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,819
we sit there and twiddle our thumbs for

366
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,100
six months waiting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully our</font>

367
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,360
generators to get delivered and and I

368
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,860
guarantee all of us have you know

369
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,900
combined probably have about 40

370
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,340
generators in order you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it</font>

00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,620
take on anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprise all the</font>

government everything else it's it's you

know it is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> exponential increase so</font>

374
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,950
you know where randy says great pass on

375
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,090
those costs and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want more you know</font>

376
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,460
more power and more cooling you just

377
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,290
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't wait to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see the</font>

generate some ingenuity I'm not

suggesting you have an answer right now

that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not deploying suggesting</font>

427
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,029
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two neat have to find out some kind</font>

428
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:41,399
of measure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we should be</font>

429
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:47,670
constructing towards so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I opened it up</font>

430
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:50,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">to you guys so from from from a</font>

431
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:53,069
technology point of view until we have

432
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:56,610
the next great quantum leap coming CMOS

433
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:57,930
I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> with less big help to us and we</font>

434
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know what that next great quantum</font>

435
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:02,729
leap is we're going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> struggling</font>

436
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,880
incrementally to keep the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power to</font>

437
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:08,400
control so I see it continue to grow and

438
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,900
and the linear the things that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

439
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,540
but so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can help</font>

440
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,429
mitigate that a little bit I think Randy

441
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,760
mentioned a few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we are</font>

442
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:19,500
fairly inefficient in terms of our

443
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,908
cooling architecture right the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

444
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,890
air that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through we're forced</font>

445
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:26,010
to make bends in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> air paths</font>

446
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:28,380
and for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sierras one we're</font>

447
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:31,140
about twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of our power goes</font>

448
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,320
to the fans right just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> power the damn</font>

449
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,590
fans so that that can be that can be a

450
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,049
mitigation the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that just</font>

451
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,059
spreading out spreading out the

452
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:44,070
equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know as gross as it might</font>

453
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:45,540
seem that that is a mitigation

454
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">gentleman said he's already facing his</font>

455
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,440
stuff out let's true in the router space

456
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:53,070
as well as well as the data center space

457
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,140
and so you know the advent some of the

458
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,030
vendors to do multi chassis systems for

459
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,850
the large large routers well<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the</font>

460
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:01,860
lead to lease do that and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> about sun</font>

461
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,899
and juniper do you guys see the power

462
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:11,490
consumption continuing to grow linearly

463
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:13,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">flatten out or so i believe is my</font>

464
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,720
colleague pointed out it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

465
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,580
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grow and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's exasperated by</font>

466
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,280
the addition of features<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

467
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,960
functionalities we continue to push wire

468
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,810
speed performance and increase the

469
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,940
connection density as we go up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 40 gig</font>

470
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:30,060
connections and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> begins to take on</font>

471
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:32,430
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> light in the market all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

472
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:35,550
going to contribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the addition of</font>

473
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:36,810
heat within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems we've got more</font>

474
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,030
gates providing that functionality

475
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,800
that's required pushing it at higher

476
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,629
speeds and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do think we are beginning</font>

477
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,550
to approach the physics limits of

478
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,900
current process technologies so i

479
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:50,790
basically concur with what you're saying

480
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:54,960
there cisco and juniper agreed please

481
00:18:50,790 --> 00:19:00,570
note the date and time well it is you

482
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:03,240
know it is 6606 anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean the other</font>

483
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,500
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would ask is if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you look</font>

484
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,480
since you're talking about a 20 year

485
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,910
sort of shelf life for your data center

486
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,280
if you were to go back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at what</font>

487
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:14,310
data centers were generating from a

488
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,530
power standpoint 20 years ago it was

489
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,230
actually about<font color="#CCCCCC"> five to 10 watts of</font>

490
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,450
square foot so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at going from</font>

491
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">five let's say you go in 10 watts a</font>

492
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:26,190
square foot even<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

493
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:29,400
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sing go 2,000 watts a square</font>

494
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:31,710
foot we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have greatly increased</font>

495
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the amount of work that can be done by</font>

496
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:35,670
well over a factor of a thousand since

497
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:37,350
then so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 year</font>

498
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">lifespan on your data center I guess the</font>

499
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,480
one question I would ask which is do you

500
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:44,669
expect over that 20 years from machines

501
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,010
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the same amount</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of work</font>

502
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,900
they were doing 20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago or a</font>

503
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,060
thousand times because one of the

504
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,770
problems we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is as you start to</font>

505
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,330
draw when you're drawing a wide and you

506
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,879
double that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> two wats it's not really</font>

507
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,990
a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal when you're drawing you know</font>

508
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,880
5,000 why

509
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,090
the next time you double that that's

510
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,130
10,000 watts 20,000 watts 40,000 watts

511
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,409
so there's an element of geometric

512
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:09,480
progression that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on in terms of</font>

513
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,950
the power usage so that's the other

514
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,559
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> too which is if you've got a data</font>

515
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,390
center you want for 20 years how much

516
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:18,660
more work do you want to be able to do

517
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,890
within that 20 year time frame just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

518
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">make a statement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that people can throw</font>

519
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,160
back in my face<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years from now I</font>

520
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,129
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that no one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will ever need</font>

521
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,650
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 20 kilowatts per rack let's</font>

522
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">write it through a 640k right um can I</font>

523
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:35,280
make a statement that he's wrong today

524
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:37,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">whoo-hoo so actually I'd like to say one</font>

525
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,360
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to address your question I'm</font>

526
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:41,429
not entirely sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

527
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know i mean history shows that yes</font>

528
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:47,070
the progression is up and to the right

529
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:48,360
as far as power is concerned but<font color="#CCCCCC"> as as</font>

530
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,520
some of the guys have indicated we're

531
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,800
running into<font color="#E5E5E5"> some roadblocks and one of</font>

532
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,410
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things is it when you get to these</font>

533
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,360
you know 100 million gate<font color="#E5E5E5"> a6 that you're</font>

534
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:59,190
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> packing so much density and so much</font>

535
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,689
power into<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones in one spot it actually</font>

536
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,460
becomes extremely difficult just to

537
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,490
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> sink that power out into the</font>

538
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,870
system and so with those limits you may

539
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,850
actually see some hiccups where it may

540
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,379
not be linear just because you reach a

541
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,719
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we'd like to add more</font>

542
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,520
density but we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually can't do</font>

543
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,740
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point source of heat is</font>

544
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,510
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much and as we've seen in like</font>

545
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,010
laptops on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pentium and stuff like</font>

546
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,390
that you run into these these tremendous

547
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:22,860
problems of actually getting that heat

548
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,700
from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point source out into the</font>

549
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:30,389
system Patrick all right Patrick for

550
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,280
mock my for the cola vendors anybody

551
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,590
putting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Colo in McMurdo base</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just</font>

552
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,820
wondering if that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a good place</font>

553
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:37,500
can you say that again this week oh it

554
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,360
was a bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> joke I asked if anybody was</font>

555
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:44,580
putting a Colo in the South Pole as a I

556
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:48,300
don't know as a brighter light is a spot

557
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,428
of hope as the hottest Colo in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terremark</font>

558
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,428
which i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> give kudos to is the</font>

559
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:55,350
densest best cold<font color="#E5E5E5"> cola we have on the</font>

560
00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:58,380
planet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's saying quite a bit</font>

561
00:21:55,350 --> 00:22:00,030
because we're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2,500 locations we are</font>

562
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,240
actually finding that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need more</font>

563
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:04,920

00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,960

565
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,090
the audience but are we are running into

566
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">a problem where we have trouble</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

567
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,010
enough spindles

568
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:14,990
and the processors are getting faster in

569
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:17,390
dual core and drawing less power at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

570
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:19,700
same time so in the last six months we

571
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:22,100
have actually found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can go from</font>

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,480
40 amp stay at 40 amps<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iraq which is</font>

573
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,070
very low for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we couldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

574
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,720
fill the rack but that's what most kolos

575
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,059
could provide and still not have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bay</font>

576
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,549
empty racks so that we could call them

577
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:33,830
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're now able to fill them at 40</font>

579
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:39,350
things like that it says this was not

580
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:41,210
true six months or before so I don't

581
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,918
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if everyone is seeing this but</font>

582
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:45,080
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually very happy that our power</font>

583
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:48,080
consumption is going down not up and

584
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,790
we're getting more bits more CPU more

585
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,720
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the same number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

586
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:56,149
amps volts watts so it's not all doom

587
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,710
and gloom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course you know a year from</font>

588
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,059
now we'll need<font color="#E5E5E5"> more power but in the</font>

589
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:06,679
meantime for the next 12 months you guys

590
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:08,660
are lucky briefly I mean the fact that

591
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:11,450
John is talking about CMT or you know

592
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:14,150
chip multi multiple cores on a chip<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

593
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:16,970
is really a pretty big sort of leap

594
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:19,190
right now that can save actually a fair

595
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,840
amount of power and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sun</font>

596
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,280
and if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and check out our Niagara</font>

597
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,928
systems you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will see that the workload</font>

598
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,899
that they do relative to the power they

599
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:29,090
draw is actually considerably larger

600
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,710
versus the amount of power so whether

601
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,720
it's us or anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else in soon chip</font>

602
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,580
multi-threading or multi-core chips that

603
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a way to look at to really be able to</font>

604
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,750
save some power because all of the other

605
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,400
ancillary pieces are there's actually a

606
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,780
fair amount of power there if you really

607
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,610
look at a machine about<font color="#E5E5E5"> only fifty</font>

608
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,250
percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the power is actually being</font>

fifty percent is being taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> up by all</font>

611
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:54,470
the other ancillary things you need it

answer that that's fine too look this is

can you talk about yeah we certainly

00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:08,990
have detectives it's kind of interesting

691
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:13,820
we had a bunch of service providers come

the response in general was pretty

exponential growth technology not only

705
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:46,820
is not keeping up with it but it's going

706
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:51,740
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sits plateauing so all these various</font>

707
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:54,800
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know multi-threaded ideas having</font>

708
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,390
turning off idle idle portions of the

00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,950
logic that<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't being used those are</font>

710
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">all great ideas and there are all great</font>

711
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,610
incremental improvements but they're

712
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,980
they're kind of like one time things

713
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:08,780
that we can we can try to do it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order</font>

714
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:11,330
to mitigate over the next few years but

715
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:13,370
the slope of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the curve is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> effective</font>

716
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:15,260
unless we do either do better technology

717
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:19,489
the other the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing to think about</font>

718
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:20,900
is maybe we need to just accept the fact

719
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,090
that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> more space there's a</font>

720
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:26,140
trade-off between space and power in

721
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:29,139
terms of the density right power density

722
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,140
so

723
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:35,769
so today will bleed crs-1 also has high

724
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:38,379
speed low speed fans so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

725
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:39,729
things like high speed low speed fans so

726
00:28:38,379 --> 00:28:41,259
that we can reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> the power required</font>

727
00:28:39,729 --> 00:28:43,539
under nominal conditions and only kick

728
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:46,989
up when there's thermal extremes in the

729
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:48,429
environment we're also looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

730
00:28:46,989 --> 00:28:49,809
have had similar conversations with

731
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:51,820
customers with regards to acceptability

732
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:55,599
of shutting down<font color="#E5E5E5"> subsystems within the</font>

733
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:57,580
system and it's typically been viewed

734
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,950
with a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a skeptical eye in</font>

735
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,599
terms of as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it comes on exactly</font>

736
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:03,460
when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to exactly when I need it</font>

to but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to have a protection</font>

738
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,909
circuit that's delayed and coming up

739
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:11,440
because you're in a suppressive state

740
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:12,940
things like that back to also your

741
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,519
comment with regards having hot spots in

742
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:18,220
the system I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's that's also</font>

743
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,440
very valid point in terms of the density

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the packages that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're putting into</font>

745
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,690
these systems today are pushing us in

746
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,639
terms of being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just design heat</font>

747
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,919
sinks that can that can sink that into

00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:32,879
the enclosure itself and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out of</font>

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,999
a geographic hot spot within the system

750
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:39,219
we do need we do need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at all of</font>

00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:40,840
the incremental changes and additions

752
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,899
that we can but we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be</font>

mindful as a vendor of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reliability</font>

756
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,809
also been some concern expressed in

757
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:52,090
terms of thermal cycling certain

00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,940
in terms of aging and long-term

those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the concerns that</font>

764

we've heard for doing mitigation steps

00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:12,039
like what didn't ask about yeah just

766
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,570
said what the one final thing on that to

767
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:16,419
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question is that we've also</font>

768
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:18,158
talked to customers about this and given

769
00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:20,109
suggestions as to what we could do and

770

one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the issues we run into is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

order to do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these features</font>

772
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">where you turn down or you turn off</font>

773
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:26,950
portions of the design and then turn it

774
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:29,109
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> on is it usually have some sort of</font>

775
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,340
latency involved with that where the

776
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:31,809
circuit has to wake up and you have to

777
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,820
essentially maybe buffer packet or

778
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:36,039
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> that may be and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

779
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,960
cases people are sensitive very

sensitive to latency as well as to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

781
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,659
know jitter and the latency where you

00:30:39,249 --> 00:30:41,620
may have low latency in one application

783
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:43,690
and then

784
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:46,090
suddenly the latency increases<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

request for that but the pushback has

788
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:58,510
been fairly fairly large from a lot of a

and delivering power and delivering

814
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,860
cooling and something people which<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

circuits so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our costs from</font>

822
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:33,219
utilities in general have gone up in

823
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,980
some states by thirty and forty percent

824
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:39,460
because of our wonderful Middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eastern</font>

00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,940
other things as well which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it</font>

827
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,010
more expensive not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only our ability to</font>

right so what we're I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean and the way</font>

842
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,649
we've kind of approach it as kind of a

syllabus is may seem silly but building

haven't had people inquire about power

interesting point might be a t6 40 if

870

next<font color="#E5E5E5"> generation of stuff that you build</font>

875
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:58,490
what I hear is people saying hey I can

00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:00,080
do for<font color="#CCCCCC"> X the density and speed and</font>

885

for increases in throughput and capacity

889
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:37,710
so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's practical for me</font>

holding holding power consumption flat

893
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:46,849
but we're definitely working towards

894
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,799
trying to reduce overall system capacity

895
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:52,049
through whatever mitigation steps we can

896
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:53,460
take in the course of the design so I

<font color="#E5E5E5">guess what I'm what I want to leave you</font>

being factored into requirements and

903
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:12,509
just just reiterate that we're at a

00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,890
point now going before in the future

905
00:36:12,509 --> 00:36:15,869
without we have to you know there's

906
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:18,269
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a set of tricks in our bags</font>

907
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:19,619
that we haven't used yet so we can

<font color="#E5E5E5">that I think we have to maybe think</font>

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,259
I have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the audience is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

00:36:48,259 --> 00:36:53,729
there is a space versus cooling

921
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,960
efficiency trade-off that we can make to

922
00:36:53,729 --> 00:37:00,538
you know to some degree so would<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you</font>

923
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:03,210
know why don't we build pops that are

00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:06,200
you know in<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheaper locations and</font>

925
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,200
backhaul more stuff

yeah that's why you back call it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:21,980
the challenge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now I'm seeing</font>

930
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:25,500
individual customer growth that is

931
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,580
rather huge you know the numbers as far

932
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,020
as customer growth that I've heard

933
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,390
earlier today<font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed about right for</font>

934
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:35,160
traffic and right now no vendors are

935
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:38,368
providing interfaces greater than 40 gig

936
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:41,460
right now and not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the foreseeable</font>

937
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:43,080

942
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:57,750
that you're aggregating more stuff in a

943
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:59,730
single location you need faster link

944

well I'm sorry wavelengths ah there's

949
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,980

00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:44,200
rackable systems was invited but I see a

990
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,970
lie to them a lot for people who are

991
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,799
looking for very dense disk solutions

992
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:50,620
and i also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a question for sun</font>

993
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,890
regarding the coming thumper product 48

994
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:55,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">discs for you you know sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of no matter</font>

995
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,460
how many processors you have in it looks

996
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:01,150
like it starts to generate a lot of heat

997
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:04,110
another so first question is what is the

998
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:07,240
heat profile of a rack full of those

999
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:08,710
second question is is there any work to

1000
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:11,560
do something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a for you hundred</font>

1001
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:13,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">ninety-six laptop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> disk box does heat</font>

1002
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,730
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> come into it for people who are</font>

1003
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:17,260
basically saying I need I ops or you

1004
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:27,700
know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just need so many terabytes of</font>

1005
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:30,430
storage per rack unit I can't give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1006
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:32,410
specific answer on that because those

1007
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,700
products well they showed up in

1008
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:38,020
Jonathan's blog they haven't actually

1009
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:41,710
shipped yet I can tell you that that

1010
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:43,120
area is being looked into I think the

1011
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:46,330
other thing that we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

1012
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:48,279
whether it's from you know a a blade box

1013
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:51,580
full of<font color="#E5E5E5"> disks or a blade box full of</font>

1014
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,230
processors there are going to be certain

1015
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:55,900
limitations that we're going to tell

1016
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:58,660
people and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pretty much be</font>

1017
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,040
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to put this in you've got to</font>

1018
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,020
sort of show us that you have the

1019
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,020
capacity in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> location you're going to</font>

1020
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:08,080
put it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cool it or thank you yawn</font>

1021
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,850
yawn good night that's one of the other

1022
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,980
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know taking there's a</font>

1023
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:13,990
responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have to make sure</font>

1024
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,870
that we can give you accurate power

1025
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:19,390
information on you know that type of

1026
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:21,730
work the other responsibilities is also

1027
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:23,049
to the people who are installing it to

1028
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,640
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that they're installing in a</font>

1029
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,800
location where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can meet the</font>

1030
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,029
requirements of the box that it has and

1031
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,370
I think that's one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas where</font>

1032
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:32,740
historically a lot of vendors including

1033
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:34,240
Sun have really sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dropped the ball</font>

1034
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,689
which is letting people go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> install</font>

1035
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,040
stuff

1036
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:38,829
in areas where they couldn't

1037
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,509
realistically support it particularly

1038
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:42,490
from a thermal standpoint and that does

1039
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:45,130
cause failures we know that if you're

1040
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:46,509
running stuff very very hot it will

1041
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:48,460
decrease the the mean time between

1042
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,750
failure so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one of the</font>

1043
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">other things that we're working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on now</font>

1044
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:57,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I know some of the other vendors are</font>

1045
00:41:51,790 --> 00:42:00,640
as well Randy nope<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay after the right</font>

1046
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:03,000
yeah I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just suggest that this</font>

1047
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,980
is phil for my as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prime Phil Rosenthal</font>

1048
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,900
the worst<font color="#CCCCCC"> offenders in terms of hardware</font>

1049
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:10,990
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not the people that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are on</font>

1050
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,849
the panel in fact they're pretty good

1051
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:17,680
all things considered that's why they

1052
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:19,180
showed up exactly and I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to point</font>

1053
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,890
out to the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they really</font>

1054
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:22,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be putting pressure on the</font>

1055
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:24,819
vendors that are producing these 1u

1056
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,339
servers that if you look at the profile

1057
00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:28,779
of where the power is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> greater than</font>

1058
00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:30,640
fifty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the power is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1059
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:33,970
towards the processors and I don't know

1060
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,680
about everyone else's but for us if you

1061
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:38,529
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a server say for example at Dell</font>

1062
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,169
1650 from five years ago versus Adele

1063
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:43,119
1850 today they're doing similar

1064
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:46,109
bandwidth because the customers have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1065
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:48,910
similar needs we have more of them and

1066
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:51,160
the processor time they're sitting at

1067
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:53,500
ninety percent idle on both of them so

1068
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,480
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we really need these bigger faster</font>

1069
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:58,150
more power hungry processors in greater

1070
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,450
density for our bottom of the lines

1071
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:02,890
servers that you can buy today I really

1072
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,828
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not the case and</font>

1073
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:07,660
vendors really need to start offering

1074
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:11,920
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> power-efficient you know losing</font>

1075
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">laptop processors instead of Zeon's and</font>

1076
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,700
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out what patrick</font>

1077
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:17,770
said that they're reaching a plateau in

1078
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,779
terms of disk density<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know for a fact</font>

1079
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:20,800
that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the vendors were buying</font>

1080
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:24,280
from are going to start distributing

1081
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,589
servers using smaller miniaturized I

1082
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,720
mean basically laptop drives but with

1083
00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:30,460
higher performance spindles so you're

1084
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:33,578
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see greater density for that</font>

1085
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:35,290
coming very soon that and there wasn't

1086
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:40,270
really a question just wanted to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1087
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:42,339
statement excellent come there is one

1088
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:43,690
area this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> true for you know basically</font>

1089
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:45,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the vendors that are working on it</font>

1090
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:48,190
which is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> area of virtualization and</font>

1091
00:43:45,579 --> 00:43:49,930
that you know it the biggest issue there

1092
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,940
from a particularly from power<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1093
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:53,230
cooling<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint which is the point</font>

1094
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the gentleman made which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is most</font>

1095
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,380
those machines are only doing about

1096
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,328
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not idle ninety percent of the</font>

1097
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,589
time so I guess one of the other

1098
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:02,410
questions is if you could actually get

1099
00:43:59,589 --> 00:44:03,910
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> machines to actually be in use</font>

1100
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:05,890
eighty percent of the time and that

1101
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:07,899
workload that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing would you</font>

1102
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:09,520
need nearly as many of them generating

1103
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:13,540
sucking nearly as much power in

1104
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:17,380
generating nearly as much heat show of

1105
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:18,700
hands anybody I think well one thing we

1106
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,200
see in the market now particularly the

1107
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,759
hosting market is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1108
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,649
widespread adoption of virtualization

1109
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,170
you know I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the dedicated</font>

1110
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:27,490
hosting market in particular is you know

1111
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:29,440
except for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the higher-end managed</font>

1112
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:31,569
hosting the the I'm gonna rent a dell

1113
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,849
box market is starting to rapidly go by

1114
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:35,470
the wayside in favor of virtualized

1115
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:37,119
private servers I mean so that's

1116
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:38,950
definitely being seen in the marketplace

1117
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:42,160
and I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on</font>

1118
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:43,868
that vendors what we have seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1119
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">think what I I kind of like what they</font>

1120
00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:49,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">did is that we have seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our Neutral</font>

1121
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:51,640
corners dropped quite a bit because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

1122
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:54,369
lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers now this stage they</font>

1123
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:57,129
require 208 volt instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 120 volt</font>

1124
00:44:54,369 --> 00:45:00,550
that eliminates the neutral phase that

1125
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:02,079
the generator less heat to the data

1126
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:07,869
centers were so there is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1127
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:10,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">you guys did really well who Randy on my</font>

1128
00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:16,720
left I've got a large crew singing I

1129
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:19,270
want my<font color="#E5E5E5"> p2p yeah I'll virtualize yeah</font>

1130
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:23,589
I'm squeezing it down but I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of</font>

1131
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:27,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">them so I'm still going to have max heat</font>

1132
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:28,750
in the rack I'm talking intimately with

1133
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,079
the router vendors and some of the

1134
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:37,470
server vendors they're working real hard

1135
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:43,089
to do what they can but when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I go to the</font>

1136
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:46,359
colo vendors in two thousand went to the

1137
00:45:43,089 --> 00:45:48,400
newest facility in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Redlands had to</font>

1138
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:50,230
with this is technology that's now six

1139
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,030
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> old we weren't even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using the</font>

1140
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:54,849
latest stuff we were trying to install

1141
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:56,589
then we had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave one third of the</font>

1142
00:45:54,849 --> 00:46:00,490
facility empty we were going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> open a</font>

1143
00:45:56,589 --> 00:46:01,660
bistro in it bill you tell me you're

1144
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:05,950
designing for 50

1145
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:09,038
years you're not designing for today I'm

1146
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:14,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to tell you I need three to 4k</font>

1147
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:16,960
per square meter today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and other people</font>

1148
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:22,329
who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick blade servers in</font>

1149
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:29,470
our twice that and that's not tomorrow

1150
00:46:22,329 --> 00:46:33,599
that's today<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one last comment or</font>

1151
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:35,919
question Tim alesio with the new mantra

1152
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,869
to what extent and I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear this</font>

1153
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,970
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> both</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sides opinions on both sides</font>

1154
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:44,500
so what extent you think standardization

1155
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:46,149
of things like let's say using larger

1156
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,619
more efficient power supplies or

1157
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,809
standardizing cabinets so you get a

1158
00:46:47,619 --> 00:46:52,089
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> airflow or you can reduce having</font>

1159
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:54,160
to have internal cooling fans which also

1160
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:55,599
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to suck power to what extent</font>

1161
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">do you think that can help mitigate this</font>

1162
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:01,510
problem and are there any efforts in in

1163
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:03,940
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> area going on right now start with</font>

1164
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:05,890
the hardware guys so I think that

1165
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:07,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be very helpful i know</font>

1166
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:10,089
that there are some efforts on the if

1167
00:47:07,779 --> 00:47:11,260
you go into like the I Triple E meetings

1168
00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:12,940
there's some efforts on the physical

1169
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,910
layer side to to look into power

1170
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:16,779
reduction but whenever you standardize

1171
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:18,038
something generally that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the</font>

1172
00:47:16,779 --> 00:47:20,230
economies of scale you get the more

1173
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:22,359
reach of research<font color="#E5E5E5"> and development</font>

1174
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:23,619
investment and we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if we</font>

1175
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:25,328
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> our products and i look at the</font>

1176
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:26,710
standardized products that go into our

1177
00:47:25,329 --> 00:47:30,069
design versus and non standardized

1178
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:31,210
products in general just the economies

1179
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:32,890
of scale and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount of investment</font>

1180
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:38,079
that goes into you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a much more</font>

1181
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:41,049
efficient product<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the one thing</font>

1182
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:43,809
that might help would be I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

1183
00:47:41,049 --> 00:47:45,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're we're working towards it's at</font>

1184
00:47:43,809 --> 00:47:47,020
least in the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the telecom router</font>

1185
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:49,930
area you're working too kind of old

1186
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:52,390
standards so I think in you and a new

1187
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:55,299
standard that that redefines what a rack

1188
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:58,660
really means maybe something that looks

1189
00:47:55,299 --> 00:48:01,059
at what<font color="#E5E5E5"> air flow architectures really</font>

1190
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:06,460
mean I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that would be a big</font>

1191
00:48:01,059 --> 00:48:08,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">help the the other stuff the other stuff</font>

1192
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:11,319
yeah we can get the more dollars we get

1193
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:12,839
into a particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> area we can we can do</font>

1194
00:48:11,319 --> 00:48:16,170
a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> job of optimizing but</font>

1195
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:18,210
I think you know we're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hamstrung</font>

1196
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:23,249
again by technology I keep harping on

1197
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:25,759
that subject so standardization along

1198
00:48:23,249 --> 00:48:28,019
the lines of things you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

1199
00:48:25,759 --> 00:48:29,369
mechanicals air flow systems things like

1200
00:48:28,019 --> 00:48:32,459
that would go a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great deal towards</font>

1201
00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:36,509
helping the situation within the context

1202
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:38,130
of a system in and of itself I think

1203
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:40,410
we're always going to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimized</font>

1204
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:42,390
designs for specific products internal

1205
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:45,799
to the system but the enclosures the

1206
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:47,999
physicals and the outside plant from the

1207
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:49,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">router's perspective</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it would help a</font>

1208
00:48:47,999 --> 00:48:51,479
good deal if there were if there was

1209
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:53,969
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> resembled design</font>

1210
00:48:51,479 --> 00:48:56,129
guidelines or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a target to shoot towards</font>

1211
00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:58,079
and there again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd be working on top</font>

1212
00:48:56,130 --> 00:49:05,609
of economies of scale that<font color="#E5E5E5"> colleagues</font>

1213
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:07,680
have spoke to there is a lot of

1214
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:09,140
standardization that's going on you know

1215
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,519
from nobody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use you know</font>

need them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like that the</font>

what's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Green Grid and so what</font>

1230
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:46,950
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start to see as these</font>

server vendors and storage vendors the

network vendors one of the things that

1236
00:49:55,529 --> 00:50:00,690
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to compete on</font>

1237
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:02,430
is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much work are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you doing given how</font>

1240
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:10,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually probably the single biggest</font>

1241
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:13,259

<font color="#CCCCCC">know by this in the industry can</font>

1244
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:21,719
actually do which is make us compete on

1245
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:24,660
how efficiently we use power and

1246
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:26,280
generate heat because then you're going

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide</font>

have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to vote with your dollars as it</font>

1263
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:06,750
were it's nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have metrics that you</font>

1264
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:08,960
can measure to help compete but I'm

1265
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:11,130
thinking specifically are the vendors

1266
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:14,220
talking to each other about ways that

1267
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:17,160
they can do things in common ways so

1268

1270
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,630
working together a data center if there

1271
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:24,150
are adjacent to each other data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center</font>

1272
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:26,910
let's say or they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interact with</font>

1273
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:32,610
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrier's I mean I'm sorry what</font>

1274
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:34,799
the facilities might have built the one

1275
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:36,330
thing that has happened which is ashray

1276
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,780
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> American Association of hitting</font>

1277
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:42,240
refrigeration engineering has come out

1278
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:43,860
with a spec that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of says okay you</font>

1279
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,049
know machines name be cold front to back

1280
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:48,210
and fans need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be variable speed and</font>

1281
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:49,980
stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so at least that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1282
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:51,120
one small area that you have a lot of

1283
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:53,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">enders now they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to build</font>

1284
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:56,370
machines that at least meet those specs

1285
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:58,740
I don't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think personally that's</font>

1286
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:00,270
just my own personal opinion you're

1287
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,069
going to actually see vendors wanting to

1288
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:04,770
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> together I mean I certainly don't</font>

1289
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:06,570
want to tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> HP how to build</font>

1290
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:07,860
cooler machines that draw less power

1291
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:10,710
because that's a competitive advantage

1292
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:12,810
for me there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be some</font>

1293
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:15,330
standards but in terms of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

1294
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:16,740
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think are a leap forward say some</font>

1295
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:18,600
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did with no chip</font>

1296
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">multithreading we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to make</font>

1297
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,830
that publicly available and give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1298
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:24,480
my competitor because that's way I can

1299
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:28,350
make money I can differentiate myself in

1300
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,730
the market very briefly<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to wind</font>

1301
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:31,799
things up this has been an excellent

1302
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:34,170
panel<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like each of the folks on the</font>

1303
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,790
panel on both sides in 30 seconds or

1304
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:38,920
less to give one thing that they would

1305
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:41,470
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the folks at the other table</font>

1306
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:44,349
to help the situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to sort of</font>

1307
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:49,118
wine things<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so let's start start at</font>

1308
00:52:44,349 --> 00:52:51,670
the end well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think basically from on</font>

1309
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:54,040
the data center side we are we request

1310
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:57,280
for vendors to as a say design more

1311
00:52:54,040 --> 00:53:00,040
efficient power supplies more efficient

1312
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,410
equipment because<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of the day</font>

1313
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:04,000
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of how to</font>

1314
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:08,040
dissipate that heat out of the data

1315
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,040
center<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's our biggest challenge</font>

1316
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:16,180
well we've been you know out with

1317
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:18,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">equinix we've been challenged by the</font>

1318
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:20,680
power<font color="#E5E5E5"> density and customers a lot of</font>

1319
00:53:18,309 --> 00:53:23,020
times they do not understand the

1320
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:25,859
statement of like spreading out the load

1321
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:29,859
they like to put everything in a

1322
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:32,859
condensed mode or compaq smallest cage

1323
00:53:29,859 --> 00:53:36,910
as possible we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to understand</font>

1324
00:53:32,859 --> 00:53:38,529
the heat load and able to dissipate that

1325
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:40,839
here you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand we need to</font>

1326
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:43,750
distribute this the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cabinets spread them</font>

1327
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:49,450
out so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can cool you guys say</font>

1328
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:51,579
properly you know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all building</font>

1329
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:53,200
really hot you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there are excuse me</font>

1330
00:53:51,579 --> 00:53:55,480
well powered big data centers now i

1331
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">think i'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see all the vendors</font>

1332
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,470
come into our<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDC's not enterprise data</font>

1333
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,150
centers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDC's which are combination</font>

1334
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:03,910
of enterprises nice peas and hosters and

1335
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:05,040
everything and and start testing their

1336
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:07,450
hardware in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> real world environment</font>

1337
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,040
let's work on thermodynamics and<font color="#CCCCCC"> flu</font>

1338
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:10,509
dynamic issues and bring it into our

1339
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:11,920
data centers we all have labs will put

1340
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:14,170
in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the floor and see if it</font>

1341
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,150
melts something or doesn't and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1342
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,559
we'll put some glycol taps and it will

1343
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:19,210
put some liquid stuff see what happens

1344
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:20,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we're happy to do it because it</font>

1345
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:23,230
benefits us and our customers later on

1346
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:25,750
building a data center is a slow-moving

1347
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:27,490
iceberg you know building<font color="#E5E5E5"> a server might</font>

1348
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:28,510
be a lot faster it takes a long time to

1349
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:33,879
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a data center so let's work</font>

1350
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:36,309
together on that when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are not</font>

1351
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:39,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">using the rag if you're not using a</font>

1352
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:42,160
certain the space use a blanket the

1353
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,920
blank so you can isolate the cold aisle

1354
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,990
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot aisle so it'll help the</font>

1355
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,520
airflow much much better that's

1356
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:50,770
interesting how much you think that in

1357
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,980
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> average facility we're putting a</font>

1358
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:54,680
blank up how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much do you think that</font>

1359
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:56,720
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll help a lot really it'll really</font>

1360
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,970
help a lot right now you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

1361
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,430
leakage going from cold aisle to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hot</font>

1362
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:03,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">oil so if you if you cover</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that up</font>

1363
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:06,440
you're gonna have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better it's</font>

1364
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:07,790
efficient very efficient system that

1365
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,720
that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fluid dynamic calm</font>

1366
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:10,609
and I was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about things what kind</font>

1367
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,220
of inspired that you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven-foot</font>

1368
00:55:10,609 --> 00:55:15,770
42u cabinet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're and you know the</font>

1369
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:17,060
middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is totally empty the air</font>

1370
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,470
you know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a raised floor</font>

1371
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,359
environment the air is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to flow up</font>

1372
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:22,160
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hole and shoot back and the</font>

1373
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:23,690
top servers are going to run dit in 99

1374
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,250
degrees the ones below they're gonna run

1375
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,180
to 72 degrees<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything's going</font>

1376
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,800
wrong and you're complaining to the

1377
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:29,569
vendor and it causes all kinds of

1378
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,220
operational and flow control issues for

1379
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:33,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">us you put blanks in holy cow it all</font>

1380
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:35,359
works and it's much more efficient and

1381
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:40,609
there's less you know cannibalization of

1382
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:41,900
space<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on okay hardware guys first</font>

1383
00:55:40,609 --> 00:55:43,609
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you on all of our</font>

1384
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:46,040
stuff we actually supply those now and

1385
00:55:43,609 --> 00:55:47,630
if you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to PG knees website</font>

1386
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,850
we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> did some work with them</font>

1387
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:51,980
recently to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually try to measure what</font>

1388
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:54,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">the increased efficiency is if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1389
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:57,890
those blanks and it was fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> sizable</font>

1390
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:59,869
the biggest thing I would ask is one is

1391
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:03,020
education not just amongst yourselves

1392
00:55:59,869 --> 00:56:05,150
but also to your customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to please</font>

1393
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:06,950
stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> using watts per square foot to</font>

00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:10,490
fundamentally flawed view of the world

1396
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:13,190
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's making the assumption that</font>

1397
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:16,069
the heat load is even and across a data

1398
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:17,660
center it never is um if you really

1399
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:21,020
start dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it in terms of a per</font>

1400

1401
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:25,160
understand and justify the requirements

<font color="#CCCCCC">that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have so that would be the one</font>

I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to actually see and this goes</font>

00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:35,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to one of the questions out there</font>

1406
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,950
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the IDC groups got</font>

1407
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:39,500
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there was some sort of</font>

1408
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:42,439
form or group that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could actually work</font>

1409
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:44,150
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us we'd be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very happy to do that</font>

1410
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,590
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we run into a lot</font>

1411
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:49,010
of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers everybody has different</font>

1412
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:50,510
requirements and we try to you know fit

1413
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:52,340
all these requirements into our design

1414
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:54,530
and it turns out that then we're sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1415
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:56,300
basically doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade offs for all these</font>

1416
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:58,520
requirements and we can't optimize for

1417
00:56:56,300 --> 00:57:00,050
any one application but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a set</font>

1418
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,130
of a general consensus across the board

1419
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:03,550
we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably do it much more</font>

1420
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:03,550
effectively

1421
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:12,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">I guess for me would be again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

1422
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:13,529
together I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last question had a</font>

1423
00:57:12,569 --> 00:57:16,410
good suggestion in terms of

1424
00:57:13,529 --> 00:57:18,390
standardization or get a group of the

1425
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:20,700
IDC people we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some service</font>

1426
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:24,598
providers that do their own facilities

1427
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:27,868
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> inventors such as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> force10 juniper</font>

1428
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:30,900
and cisco and try to strategize on

1429
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:33,210
what's the facility architecture should

1430
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,799
look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> generation I</font>

1431
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:39,270
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been dealing with with</font>

1432
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:42,450
legacy architectures for too long so I'd

1433
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:44,430
hope we'd come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a an architecture</font>

1434
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:48,118
that would make cooling easier make the

1435
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:50,250
air flow easier that would go a big ways

1436
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:53,190
to to helping us reduce the amount of

1437
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:59,069
power that we consume just in fans for

1438
00:57:53,190 --> 00:58:02,309
example today is the vendor when we are

1439
00:57:59,069 --> 00:58:04,288
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFPs from our customers they're all</font>

1440
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:06,329
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place with regards to what the</font>

1441
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:09,150
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the environmental look</font>

1442
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:10,770
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> there maybe that's a little it if I</font>

1443
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:12,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">purpling but they are they're quite</font>

1444
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:15,900
quite diverse in the needs that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

1445
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:17,849
so it helped a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot to have some common</font>

1446
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,470
common standards that standards that

1447
00:58:17,849 --> 00:58:23,069
people are shooting towards in terms of

1448
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:25,259
data center designs also to update some

1449
00:58:23,069 --> 00:58:27,210
of the nomenclature would help a great

1450
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:29,430
deal as you were describing with regards

1451
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:32,490
to taking a look at the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of power</font>

1452
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:33,930
for the amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work required from the</font>

1453
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:36,118
router perspective we look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in</font>

1454
00:58:33,930 --> 00:58:38,578
terms of gigabits per kilowatt consumed

1455
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:41,490
or the reciprocal of that kilowatts per

1456
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:42,839
gig it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessary so some common</font>

1457
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:46,020
language like that I believe would help

1458
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:47,910
us a lot as well thanks sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like</font>

00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:50,400
to thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> the panel for the great work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>
