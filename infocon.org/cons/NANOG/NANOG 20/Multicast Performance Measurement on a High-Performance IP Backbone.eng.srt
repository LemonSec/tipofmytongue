<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so hi my name is Robert Beverly I</font>

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:09,149
worked for for mci worldcom on the vb NS

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm here to just talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:16,379
quickly some work we're doing in the

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:18,980
multicast space so some history on on

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,140
the VBS really just a quick slide we've

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,090
were an NSF sponsored network that's

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">National Science Foundation and part of</font>

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,440

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,660
the performance it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,480
difficult in a multicast Network when

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,000
you have a some number of senders and of

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,290
course multiple receivers so developed a

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,320
protocol to actually control a number of

23
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:11,610
end hosts to synthesize traffic and

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:15,720
receive traffic so some details on the

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:18,780
VBS multicast Network and in each of our

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:22,380
pops we have about 13 pots we have a son

27
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,040
altar to with an OC 12 Nick and this

28
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:31,530
connects with a direct TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> c / 32 a local</font>

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:34,380
juniper m40 the<font color="#CCCCCC"> m40 s have posts and now</font>

30
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,610
they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the 48 links across the</font>

31
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,199
country and ATM<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup links the pasta</font>

32
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,939
links are always preferred and this is a

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,950
pin sparse mode domain so the the

34
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,658
protocol was designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow maximum</font>

35
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,299
flexibility so there's essentially a

36
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,860
demon that<font color="#E5E5E5"> runs on each of these son</font>

37
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">hosts and listens for control</font>

38
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,210
instructions whether to receive packets

39
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:00,060
send packets or so on so there's a

40
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,369
health check message there's a message

41
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that says</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay send some number of</font>

42
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:08,610
packets of some size on some particular

43
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,410
group at some particular rate and then

44
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,660
you would in conjunction with that have

45
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,970
to tell

46
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,799
all of the receivers to expect to

47
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:20,060
receive some number of packets on some

48
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:23,090
group so the way the test would work is

49
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,100
that a coordinator a central

50
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,720
coordinating post<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go ahead and</font>

51
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">check the health of all all of the</font>

52
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,150
demons on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the boxes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then it</font>

53
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,630
would select 11 sender and 10 receivers

54
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:38,000
across the country the<font color="#CCCCCC"> coordinator would</font>

55
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,490
then send control instructions to the

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,260
receivers telling them to go ahead and

57
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,570
expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive these packets on some</font>

58
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,549
group the receivers will then open the

59
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,700
socket and the igmp membership will be

60
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:51,860
sent the coordinator then we'll send the

61
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,399
transfer control instruction to a single

62
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,710
host who will then begin transmitting

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,920
the receivers during this time collect

64
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:03,140
lost information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miss ordering</font>

65
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,910
information so each packet actually has

66
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,989
a sequence number in it and it can

67
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:11,150
detect which packets were lost so the

68
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:13,970
receiver will wait for the the last

69
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,950
expected packet or will timeout waiting

70
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,290
on the last expected packet one way or

71
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,299
the other and the coordinator waits for

72
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,070
acknowledgments and all of the receivers

73
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:26,930
and then it gathers<font color="#CCCCCC"> lots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of information</font>

74
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:28,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and generates some nice graphs and HTML</font>

75
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,260
on our web page<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then select a</font>

76
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,930

77
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:38,209
this is done every every night on on the

78
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:40,070

and then the sender will start sending

97
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:36,090
and just really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly the way it works</font>

98
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:39,389
is that it will encapsulate this in an

102
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:52,169

also have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the path of ocx months</font>

119
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,450
this is what gives a summary of all all

120
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,849
the performance so the lost numbers are

121
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,740
very small this was run at as you can

122

130
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,190
the best MP code in to do that so you

131
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,849
can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the shape of the tree</font>

132
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,550
by by doing some

133
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:24,279
recursive SNMP pulling this is just a

134
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:27,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">Perl script that does this and you can</font>

135
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:29,709
see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of time that states been</font>

136
00:06:27,309 --> 00:06:34,599
installed and syn packet counts and it

137
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:36,369
should follow that the the sites<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

138
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:37,688
are farther down the tree obviously

139
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:41,949
should have more loss than the ones

140
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:43,809
closer to the source so here's some

141
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:46,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">examples of the the graphs that are</font>

142
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:49,779
generated so you can see in the upper

143
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:52,779
picture there's some bursty loss whereas

144
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:56,830
in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lower hand picture there</font>

145
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:59,439
is really only<font color="#E5E5E5"> two periodic losses there</font>

146
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,839
and I can't entirely explain this but

147
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:04,629
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the type of characteristics we</font>

161
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:40,479
of course so some causes<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the loss or</font>

for an anti audience things that might

that the attached customers are also

running multicast codes we don't have an

186
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,600
is we've now done this at fairly high

that just under 400 megabits per second

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,339
and this was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a proof of</font>

191
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,170

out recently with something called smart

type benchmarking documents for IP

217

218
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:32,729
some some higher rate testing crafts

00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:36,000
with the net comm systems boxes with

and be nicer to get above 490 bits but

224
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,860
this may be difficult going to try to do

225
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:50,790
some group capacity testing seeing the

226
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,949
number of groups but and latency

227
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:57,029
involved in various things like this for

228
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:58,560
the state and some of these terminology

229
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:01,290
some of this terminology comes directly

230
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,989
from the IETF RFC the mixed class

231
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:06,980
throughput so on and so forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's</font>

232
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,980
all I had three

233
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,550
sure

234
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,780
it's question time so I'm think of your

235
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,760
question you have you showed a page that

236
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">showed that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the test results</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of SNMP</font>

237
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,439
polling and you said you could see the

238
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:37,020
shape of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tree what what does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

239
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:40,240
mean so yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you back to that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

240
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:45,790
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shape of the tree is</font>

241
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:48,340
essentially the the root the root<font color="#CCCCCC"> note</font>

242
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:51,430
here it recur superlative that recursos

243
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:53,740
up so it knows every end end hosts and

244
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,750
it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so who is your upstream</font>

245
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,660
neighbor and then it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> go ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

246
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,670
pull smm people its upstream neighbor

247
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:04,750
and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth so you can see</font>

248
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:06,520
the root and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then below that is the next</font>

249
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,870
person in the tree in the next person

250
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tree this script really should be</font>

251
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,400
written<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know do something</font>

252
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:15,730
graphical or something much nicer<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

253
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,770
this this is just a rough type and

254
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,670
obviously could be presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a much</font>

255
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,670
nicer fashion
