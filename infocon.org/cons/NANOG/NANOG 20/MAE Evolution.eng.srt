00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,519
through this initiative<font color="#CCCCCC"> Feldman before</font>

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,539
but I'll take that as a as a good thing

8
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,800
but I've known Steve for 20 years so

9
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:38,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's at least I'm familiar with them</font>

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,718
ciety well talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the what's</font>

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,420
going on with the maze this is sort of

12
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,010
the maze status and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,050
cover it sort of three areas in this in

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,809
this talk we have the two platforms at

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,809
the may right now the city platform and

16
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,030
the ATM platform and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

17
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some work things we're</font>

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,850
looking at in terms of other

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,140
architectures and we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,879
cover one case that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to be</font>

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:05,670
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at so we'll start so it the</font>

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,939
change form a<font color="#CCCCCC"> East this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year it's been</font>

23
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,380
that we've for ATM we used to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in one</font>

24
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,529
location 80 when people in Boulevard

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,470
with a number of the b PX switches today

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,750
were spread across three locations and

27
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,240
so we have sort of a small metropolitan

28
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,549
area network to for the exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,960
and so they do three sites of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

30
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,840
original site at Boone<font color="#E5E5E5"> Boulevard and we</font>

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,169
have a site and resident in a site in

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,030
ashburn and we have an additional sites

33
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:39,270
land for probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> first quarter 2001</font>

34
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:40,799
again in the same general area the the

35
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,990
sites all have switches at the sites

36
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,369
they have obviously transported

37
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,710
colocation which was the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

38
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:52,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">Boone as we were running short on those</font>

39
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:54,990
commodities the benefits of distributed

40
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:58,740
may is from one perspective is increase

41
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:01,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">the capacity in terms of ports circuits</font>

42
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,780
colocation etc and then it gives us some

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">a benefit from a resilience perspective</font>

44
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,560
if due to some sort of catastrophe you

45
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,270
loftus thought you wouldn't necessarily

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,440
lose the whole may you would have have

47
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,990
the other two other two or<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

48
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,829
locations

49
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:20,140
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> available or viable and the again</font>

50
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,600
we haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with West yet</font>

51
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,299
it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 55 market but there's a</font>

52
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably by second quarter next year</font>

53
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:32,320
will be an additional site of West don't

54
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:34,840
know where yet so I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a</font>

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,239
little bit about the service type that

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,800
we have on the ATM today and we see it

57
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,230
sometimes people take a crack at

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,280
describing a ton analyst but so what it

59
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,929
is is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ABR service and really the</font>

60
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,500
metric that we use in provisioning the

61
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">PVC is PC R equals 2 times NCR so the</font>

62
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,220
customers via<font color="#CCCCCC"> pier maker or whatever</font>

63
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,230
method they use which is hopefully

64
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">career maker they decide they want to</font>

65
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,459
nmc are<font color="#CCCCCC"> of n cells and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Pierre maker go</font>

66
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,550
ahead and set pcr<font color="#CCCCCC"> two times themselves</font>

67
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:07,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other piece that happens today is</font>

68
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:09,910
that MCR when total<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not exceed the</font>

69
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">accessport</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speed to whether the ports</font>

70
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,910
are the same size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different IDs or</font>

71
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,290
different customers doesn't matter with

72
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:18,790
you can't over subscribe with this today

73
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,549
we're making one change we're going to

74
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,859
do a new release on the provisioning

75
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:27,810
code in<font color="#CCCCCC"> November and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

76
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:31,540
going to cap the size of the pvcs and

77
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,460
there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for the so this will</font>

78
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,290
dis on this particular service which we

79
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of called a guaranteed service we</font>

80
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,780
have MCR can't exceed fifty percent of

81
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:44,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the port speed down to an apprentice e12</font>

82
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,480
access you can't exceed 25 percent of

83
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:51,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being a PCR is twice that so you</font>

84
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,530
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get fairly reasonable MCR and TCR</font>

85
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,330
out of the system we did a review and

86
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,060
audit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current PVCs there's only I</font>

87
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:02,050
think to that exceed these criteria so

88
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:05,410
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a huge change the</font>

89
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,290
goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to protect the service</font>

90
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,670
its extent as possible so to give you

91
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,700
familiar with the BP<font color="#CCCCCC"> act at all at all</font>

92
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,929
you know that the trunks RLC 12 and we

93
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,429
have multiple trunks between the

94
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,079
switches but nonetheless if we rent if

95
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,389
you're in a full

96
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,620
it's mostly 12<font color="#CCCCCC"> PVC it makes it a little</font>

97
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:24,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit tricky at times we're going to have</font>

98
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,539
a new service type available in<font color="#E5E5E5"> November</font>

99
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,948
probably early November would make an

100
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:31,169
update<font color="#CCCCCC"> to peer maker just and this</font>

101
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:35,370
systems out of the lot of requests for

102
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:37,650
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> uvr type service that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> May we're</font>

104
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:43,250
we're going to basically have a UV are

105
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:47,549
like service so in this case we'll set

106
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:50,580
it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the pvcs will still be a br and</font>

107
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,159
so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that you know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vsv</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> d</font>

109
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:58,229
is working but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set MCR to</font>

110
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,419
a low value with 100 cells per second

115
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:14,279
get a choice for<font color="#E5E5E5"> saving so in this case</font>

116
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:17,069
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCR will be can be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> full will be set</font>

117
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:19,169
to full bandwidth for a ds3 up to fifty

118
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:21,150
percent for an OC 3 so that the cells

119
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:24,779
give mark feel T equals<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in that</font>

120
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:27,419
range anything above that is police

121
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:28,979
obviously and 100 cells go through but

122
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,628
that's not very much so that's that's

123
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:33,960
just sort of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> smallest number you can</font>

124
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:38,159
do on the switches comfortably and again

125
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,839
MCR can't exceed the access port<font color="#E5E5E5"> port</font>

126
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:41,339

127
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,949
an MCR perspective but you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

128
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:46,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">of hundreds of PVCs into into those so</font>

129
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:47,909
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ton of huge constraint service</font>

130
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,520

platform to support over the past

143
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,770
history and we spend sort of a

144
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,568
disservice to the customers to some

145
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,758
extent having the instability of the

platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> at times I think everyone's</font>

147
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:41,800
aware of this and then the facility at

148
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:44,650
1919 gallows is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a problematic</font>

149
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,030
facility for us and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so to reinstate we</font>

150
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,479
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to reinstate this platform</font>

151
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:52,000
with that facility at that point there

152
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:54,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">was no if the decision was made to just</font>

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,800
support the ATM and<font color="#E5E5E5"> east there's a faq</font>

154
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:59,080
on the main net web page<font color="#CCCCCC"> that talks</font>

155
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,610
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at the</font>

156
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:06,880
turning it down the end of februari

157
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,900
obviously there is opportunity to move

158
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,909
to ATM but that kind of gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a</font>

159
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,250
timeline but it's not too close in the

160
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:14,349
future at West we had the same problem

161
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,360
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Giga switches of not wanting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

163
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,699
space parameters so what we did is

164
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:23,289
replace that equipment at West so the

165
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:26,080
Mae West video<font color="#CCCCCC"> is running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

172
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:41,440
during the period and late-september

173
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:43,479
early<font color="#CCCCCC"> October and so the Giga switches</font>

174
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,860
were powered down about two weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago at</font>

175
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:49,419
West need to learn no more this is the

176
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,909
same platform effectively that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they run</font>

177
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:54,609
at the aim side of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> may and we have a</font>

179
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,830
and again that's all on on their side

180
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,370
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basic cable trend</font>

its there in the fashion it is but we

believe it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be for the people that are</font>

customers over and there wasn't a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

191
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:30,969
awareness necessarily I'm going to talk

192
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:33,399
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about a I mean a lot of</font>

00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:35,799
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at architectures for for</font>

195
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">at several right now and this is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

196
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:42,250
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about one of them a little bit I</font>

197
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,139
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of think of it of it is in two ways</font>

198
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,180
they're sort of aggregation platforms

199
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:47,589
which the ATM could be and then there is

200
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,489
there is a type of peering that's done

201
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:53,560
it some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other exchanges which which</font>

202
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,360
looks more like private appearing and

203
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,359
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about aggregation here</font>

204
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:07,180
the wrong way nearly so from a service

205
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:08,980
perspective the goals is to have equal

206
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,920
and neutral access to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> exchange and</font>

207
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,470
this is in respect to you know all

208
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,969
commerce you know and in whatever order

209
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,040
they queue up for the service we don't

210
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:22,540
give preferential treatment to any any

211
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,219
customers and again we try to goal is to

212
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:27,279
apply the same rules and st. policies to

213
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:30,490
all we want to provide a stable service

214
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,350
interface that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious going to</font>

215
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,790
protect shared resources so in the core

216
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,680
of core than may or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the court of</font>

217
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,930
exchange it needs to be reliable not

218
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,630
dropped cells etc to the core packets to

219
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">the extent possible and again this is a</font>

220
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:47,589
from our perspective we want to enable

221
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:49,779
to you that users to absolutely manage

222
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:52,750
their relationships and so that we have

223
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:55,600
the two cases or multiple cases where

224
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:58,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">you might have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a ISP or cover the wants</font>

225
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,089
appear with everyone and that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

226
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,319
an ISP or customer

227
00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:03,059
my spear with a few other entities

228
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:04,529
that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> too it's not really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

229
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:06,899
business we just provide the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange</font>

230
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:09,870
and enable the customers to make the

231
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:12,660
erase relationships themselves and we

232
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:14,459
want to you know everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> does leverage</font>

constrained by some are platforms today

235
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:21,120
for obvious reasons and we not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

other and it from a driver's internally

00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:27,779
we're looking at you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal</font>

things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know more bandwidth more port</font>

243
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,990
48 obviously the be Jackson's won't

244
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:43,370
scale forever in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of</font>

245
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:45,600
application it's what we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been testing</font>

246
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,850
for this particular type of application

247
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,430
is a in phila score<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a frame</font>

248
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:54,089
interface so this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be your could be</font>

249
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:57,779
your juniper box with POS ports and with

00:10:54,089 --> 00:11:00,749
frame encapsulation on them map the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DLC</font>

is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> LSPs at the core and run an</font>

252
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:04,350

253
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,259
would lend look a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> LA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or two if if</font>

254
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:09,870
you layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> two may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lakad like ATM but</font>

255
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:13,199
without some of the other baggage that

256
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:16,679
goes with it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that model we would</font>

257
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:20,849
offer lc3<font color="#CCCCCC"> tosi 48 from a customer base</font>

258
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:22,559
in perspective the good things about

259
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,199
this is the provisioning is pretty

260
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,699
straightforward from both sides with a

261
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:32,099
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of complicated interface between</font>

262
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:33,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">customer CP and made core we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

263
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,259
exchange any routing information in this

264
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:39,179
model again you can change the core

265
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,259
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> changing the server level</font>

266
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:42,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">service level interface and make sure</font>

267
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:45,139
you can move things underneath that

268
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:45,139
interface

269
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,170
and again you then you with the frame

270
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:54,120
you don't have the cell text you don't

271
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:55,680
you have cheaper cost of cpe less<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

272
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,769
real estate<font color="#E5E5E5"> on CP certain routers will</font>

273
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,750
give you one ATM slot report and<font color="#CCCCCC"> for POS</font>

274
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:03,000
quarts per slot I said that backwards

275
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:06,350
but you get the idea so it works out

276
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,660
better in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ways in ATM</font>

277
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:11,660
everything has problems this included

278
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,920
we've been doing testing with juniper

279
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,560
and there's really only like two like

280
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,949
over this ccc feature they have there's

281
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,260
no way of doing a frame to anything else

282
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,390
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> platform there's a minor you</font>

283
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">know problem with the LCI</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ranges that</font>

284
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:32,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can use in their implementation and</font>

285
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,209
then the real problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in to working</font>

is related to that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:22,680
cloud can then get a PVC or multiple

343
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:25,050
PVCs into the maze for the purposes of

344
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:30,060
hearing or how does that house that

345
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:32,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually really working I in this way</font>

346
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,770
way to exist is that if you're an ATM

347
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:39,200
customers you can be accessed appear

348
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:42,180
maker and you need to talk to other

349
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,920
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the may and agree to Pierre</font>

350
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,810
agree to that yes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they're</font>

351
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,569
basically won't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> entering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a trenta a</font>

352
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,880
request in to the pier maker in it then

353
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,140
sends an email off to the person that

354
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,180
you've already<font color="#E5E5E5"> made an agreement with</font>

355
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,650
and they come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and acknowledge you</font>

356
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">know they can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> either accept or decline</font>

357
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:01,290
it basically so as all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need is a pipe</font>

358
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:05,730
into your ATM clouds and a life is good

359
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:07,709
that's correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you um are you</font>

somewhat short notice here I understand

00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:30,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question I think that will have to</font>

392
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:31,770
be and looked at case by case and that's

<font color="#E5E5E5">really sort of more than marketing sales</font>

can't give them good answer them<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if</font>

marketing and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always believe me</font>

400

this has been proud of<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a whole lot</font>

401
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,260
of people at this point the issue is

402
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:50,580
simply that originally I realized to be

403
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,169
in the februari now for riginal you guys

404
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,610
are saying the end of the year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I got</font>

00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:55,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">about two months notice on this well</font>

406
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,418
we're still waiting for this to go in a

407
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,669
little concerned that everyone's I'm

408
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,960
pretty short notice for the net move and

409
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:02,730
will there be potentially any

410
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,140
consideration of postponement of the

411
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:09,030
turn down if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still customers</font>

412
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:10,320
with pending insults I can't Vance we

413
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,490
looked at case but you know wrap a look

414
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,559
at the situation at the time and if

415
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,840
they're certainly I don't think anyone's

416
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,250
gonna be unreasonable but I can't give

417
