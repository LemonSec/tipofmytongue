to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more a little broader</font>

than just carnivore talk to some of the

for us lately in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the area</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> electronic</font>

00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,910
to show you the screens a couple of

43
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:59,649
screens on carnivore like to talk to you

44
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:02,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">also about dragon where which has been</font>

45
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:04,090
in the press recently what that is talk

46
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:05,800
about when when and how carnivore is

47
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,869
used and dragon where for it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

48
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,919
matter and then a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on how does</font>

00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,720
whole presentation or at the end we can

52
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:19,240
do that first of all i'm sure those of

53
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,580
you who were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come over here on a</font>

54

Sunday evening and listen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> mark eckin</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">weiler you know a bit now and have a</font>

56
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,970
good grounding in some of the legal

57
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,480
aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> of carnivore so I wanted to very</font>

58
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,040
upfront say look carnivore is it was

59
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,750
developed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus on our legal</font>

60
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,760
requirements for conducting electronic

61
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,620
surveillance particularly some of those

62
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,899
are requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> together with</font>

63
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,250
particularity that is two together only

64
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,280
information which<font color="#CCCCCC"> the court order says</font>

65
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,959
we can get to be very precise in what we

66
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,760
do collect and it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very</font>

67
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,050
comprehensive as get everything we're

68
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,399
supposed to collect and nothing that

69
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:53,980
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flight so I want</font>

70
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those legal concepts out</font>

71
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,280
of the way very quickly at a very high

72
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:01,929
level apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark for that</font>

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:05,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">high level Connor Brewer is focused on</font>

74
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:07,510
evidence gathering it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is uh that's the</font>

75
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,830
distinction really between carnivore and

76
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,069
most of the commercial devices that

77
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,750
we've seen or tried so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very very</font>

78
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:16,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">unique requirement that law enforcement</font>

79
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,480
has and law enforcement working with a

80
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,619
carrier in this in this case very unique

81
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,750
requirement and we haven't seen

82
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,330
commercial devices quite capable of

83
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,680
doing what we needed in a way that met

84
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,760
the legal<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements I've talked about</font>

85
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,670
the particularity and comprehensiveness

86
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:37,109
when we use it and how we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it first</font>

87
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:40,780
of all law enforcement agency only uses

88
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:43,000
the carnivore device with lawful

89
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,940
authorization and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I say that I mean</font>

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost always with a court order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

91
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:52,660
is a some very now cases where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

92
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,260
use it if we have permission of a person

93
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,450
who's actually communicating a victim

94
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,640
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance but that's very very</font>

95
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:04,690
unusual it's almost without exception

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,548
with a court order we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it with</font>

97
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,470
the assistance of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put ISP here but</font>

98
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:11,519
it's really network or system

99
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:14,920
administrator we always always have

100
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,769
assistance from the technical people at

101
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,750
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network when we were implementing</font>

102
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:23,080
carnivore and we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it only when</font>

103
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,729
it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense to use it so I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

104
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,590
people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've tried the last few</font>

105
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">months to make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to people that</font>

106
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,869
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we're not pushing carnivore as</font>

107
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,850
a first choice to love electronic

108
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,370
surveillance on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet it's very</font>

109
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the opposite it is a tool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

110
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,080
tool bag which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty thin right now</font>

111
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,789
but it is a tool and we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it when it</font>

112
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,229
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense when it's the best tool it</font>

113
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:45,880
may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the screwdriver in the tool</font>

114
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:48,490
has a limited use but we go to it

115
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,760
occasionally because it's the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool</font>

116
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:54,580
for some processes a little bit about

117
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:58,240
how it works first of all carnival work

118
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,760
filters in stages it has a very low

119
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,590
level filtering capability to pretty

120
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,469
much I take the word filtered back it's

121
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,570
in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> more like I see if it it blocks</font>

122
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:08,940
data and allows only certain data to

123
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,639
pass through so there's a very low level

124
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,819
filtering

125
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,740
CF and then there's a next layer up

126
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:18,409
sieve and then the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer up so it's</font>

127
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,840
a kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stage thing so it's not the</font>

128
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:23,779
concept where we're sucking information

129
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:27,049
into a box and doing some sort of you

130
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:29,449
know massive analysis of it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out</font>

131
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:32,120
what's interesting what's not it filters

132
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:35,120
on addresses it looks for addresses not

133
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">context so very want to be very clear we</font>

134
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,129
we're not using this device to say sniff

135
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,960
out the word terrorist or bomb or

136
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:43,789
cocaine or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

137
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,340
gather that information wherever it

138
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:50,919
happens to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the court orders will</font>

139
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:54,020
state what the targeted information is

140
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:57,409
by either an account or a subjects name

141
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:59,000
a description and IP address a an

142
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:00,438
internet account name or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,719
that something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives us the</font>

144
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,870
particularity we need so we're not doing

145
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:07,969

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,919
holding information and on the disk and

149
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,688
we could go back and reconstruct it and

150
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,060
then there's two modes though there's a

a pen register and a trap-and-trace just

155
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,159
gathers addressing information it's the

156
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:33,830
equivalent of phone numbers who

157
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:37,819

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also an audit trail within</font>

165
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:58,188
carnivore system so that we know what it

166
00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:01,399
was used for how it was used when it was

167
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:04,569
changed those sorts of things quick

171
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:15,039
basically point out that that there is

00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,630
an isolation

173
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,690
function within carnivore and it's right

174
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,790
here there's a commercial device that we

175
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:26,900
use to isolate the network so carnivore

176
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:31,310
is not a live interactive server it's

177
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,690
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more like a sniffer and by the</font>

178
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,950
way I when I use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the word sniffer I</font>

179
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:36,469
think everybody's very comfortable what

180
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,390
that means but<font color="#E5E5E5"> last week when I gave a</font>

00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:41,060
presentation someone came up to me later

182
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:43,070
just very jokingly said you know when

183
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,740
you say karma was like a sniffer you

184
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:48,050
really ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say carnivores like</font>

187
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,770
analyzer if we're all right with that

188
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,930
and you'll know I mean sniffer when I

189
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,849
say protocol analyzer but the

190
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,260
distinction being<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the thing the</font>

191
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,900
point of this screen is that there is

192
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,760
isolation it's a passive device it's a

193
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,799
one-way tap so we're looking at

194
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,570
information that's flowing through the

195
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,740
network but we're not we're not putting

196
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,360
information on that where there's no

197

00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,480
also a carnival you'll note we don't

those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all segregated to a point that</font>

212

that we have some security control over

with this device under is on there is a

there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> highly-trained</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group of</font>

FBI has a suite of tools not just

carnivore<font color="#CCCCCC"> but its suite of tools so you</font>

know real quickly what dragon where is

00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,380
just a concept of carnivore the protocol

exactly what it sounds like it does it

00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,350
puts the raw<font color="#E5E5E5"> native data back into</font>

00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,690

post-processing process we don't we

don't monitor this in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time</font>

256
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,550
typically some of the issues that I

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,400
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit real</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quick before I go the</font>

258
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,520
demos obviously there's there's growth

259
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,020
in data transmissions data communication

260
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,699
so there's naturally going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be growth</font>

261
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,340
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of law enforcement</font>

262
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:56,530
interest in that but to give you some

263
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:59,970
rough numbers the FBI had I believe 335

264
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:02,560
orders last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year for title 3 it is</font>

265
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,540
communication intercepts on all

266
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,329
communication technologies wireless

267
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:09,640
wireline including data and computer

268
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,870
computer type information internet so

269
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,350
the numbers here are fairly small

270
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,520
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously growth in this kind of</font>

271
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,890
communication area so we expect this to

272
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,530
be some growth obviously the number of

273
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:22,030
ISPs is unbelievably large number of

274
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,699
private networks is growing it's

275
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,560
unbelievably large so the concepts of

276
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,420
strategic intercept capabilities don't

277
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,290
make sense and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why you see this</font>

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">very large i don't know how many i know</font>

that would have intercepted<font color="#CCCCCC"> thority but</font>

289
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:52,689
it's still significant and again you'll

they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got some contact numbers for me</font>

294
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:06,219
an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> address and that first game</font>

295
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:14,709
should be lower case I don't know that

296
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:18,670
matters and then my phone number<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

297
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:20,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">right I'm going to move now to to what's</font>

298
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:23,199
really more interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think and</font>

299
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:24,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> carnivore demonstration I have</font>

301
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:28,810
secret i was in the press I think

302
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:30,250
yesterday we we had two versions and I

303
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,660
think we've said from the start<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

304
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,490
two versions there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always two versions</font>

305
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,079
of everything is one you're using and

306
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,519
one you're developing at the very least

307
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:38,380
there's probably more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

308
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,870
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the trash can that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

309
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:44,199
already finished using but the diversion

310
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:46,839
of carnivore that we use now and we use

311
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:51,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">it sparingly I think we've counted less</font>

312
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:55,089
than 30 times is this version 1 dot 34

313
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:57,130
not too exciting this is really not when

314
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:58,990
you see this you'll you'll recognize it

315
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:04,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">for what it is it's not real exciting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

316
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:07,350
piece of software look at carnivore the

317
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:10,600
software application is this it runs on

318
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:14,350
normally NT workstation could be windows

319
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,180
2000 now the screen i showed earlier

320
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,350
with all the connection information is a

a

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,000
a bunch of libraries associated with it

332
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,569
and then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a driver sits on an</font>

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">aircard and that's that's the pieces it</font>

334
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,960
has a starting to stop a big red light

335
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,360
means it stopped and a big green light

336
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,360
means it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going so it's very simple at</font>

337
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,910
this level the<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced screen pops up</font>

338
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,750
what is in fact the way we would set up

339
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:03,160
carnivore to intercept and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font>

340
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,130
you the second version because it's very

341
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">important to see the distinction between</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the first version second version of the</font>

343
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,550
main features added by a second version

344
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,710
is to simplify this mess this is a

345
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,599
pretty complicated screen for someone

346
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,370
and now<font color="#CCCCCC"> people know how to use it can</font>

347
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,630
readily jump to it but I'll show you why

348
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:25,750
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly complicated everybody see</font>

349
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:27,070
that arrow pretty well if you can't read

350
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,130
the text it doesn't matter i'll tell you

351
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:33,390
what it does in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this block here is where</font>

352
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:37,030
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do fixed IP address intercepts</font>

353
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:39,730
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll just put a fixed IP address in</font>

354
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:42,010
there and basically in a network where

355
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,790
you could fix the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

356
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:48,400
particular target we would if you if you

357
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,520
can do it with in a secure manner fixed

358
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:55,090
IP address we fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if we can't fix it</font>

359
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:59,370
we don't use that but a real quick idea

360
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:59,370
of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works you can also add in a</font>

361
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:06,580
range such that if you could fix it to a

362
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:08,620
range and exclusively make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody</font>

363
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,970
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on that range our job</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

364
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,280
filtering and finding the bad guy is

365
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,720
done and they all we do is use this

366
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,939
device to actually collect it but it's

367
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,430
it's actually sorted by the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

368
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:23,830
so that's one method<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we might use</font>

369
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:26,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do that keeping in mind that there's</font>

370
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:28,590
logic to apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how this works so</font>

371
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,630
it's a complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> net you know</font>

372
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,100
combination of Ann's and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ors that aren't</font>

373
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,290
very evident from looking at this screen

374
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,870
and that's why the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> version makes it</font>

375
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:39,760
simpler what an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is down here in</font>

376
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,310
this blog we tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> it what we're trying</font>

377
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,960
to do the default<font color="#E5E5E5"> what might be to</font>

378
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:46,239
collect nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's remember it's like</font>

379
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">a see if it blocks everything out only</font>

380
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,900
certain things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are allowed through and</font>

381
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,230
we might default to actually collecting

382
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,480
nut

383
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,840
thing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular case though we</font>

384
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,590
can choose for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for this example tcp</font>

385
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:02,170
ports either in a pen register mode or

386
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:04,330
full content married let's let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

387
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,530
full content because it's very easier I

388
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,260
think for people to understand what

389
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:09,910
flexing all the content is I supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

390
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:14,500
arguing about what a pen register is or

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:17,079
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> it shouldn't be and now the</font>

392
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,870
concept in this is your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your now have a</font>

393
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,690
comp lit more complicated filter that

394
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:26,380
says collect information to and from

395
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:28,960
these fixed IP range is that our TCP

396
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:33,910
session so you start to fund or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dance</font>

397
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:38,770
to the theological question other

398
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:44,199
questions whoops by which that would

399
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:47,380
happen once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have you decided ready</font>

400
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,520
set it up to do that you will set up

401
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,050
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> ports you're interested in</font>

402
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,400
intercepting at this point way it's set

403
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,709
up it'll actually intercept nothing

404
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,949
because you haven't allowed to see if to

405
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:59,590
pass through certain ports an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

406
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:01,150
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might do is choose a port and</font>

407
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:04,780
and i'll choose email because it's

408
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:07,089
fairly understandable and everybody

409
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:10,300
knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ports aren't you know hard to</font>

410
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:12,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">find wired in what they do so i want to</font>

411
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,619
point out though that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an example</font>

412
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,180
very often our target we do know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

413
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:17,770
port is using we do know why he's using

414
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they'll use obscure ports for</font>

415
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,359
specific reasons so this allows us to

416
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:23,829
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at one port if we know and</font>

417
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:25,740
have information is that one port is

418
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:29,679
where the important communications are

419
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:33,430
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you might be able to to add</font>

420
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:37,120
ports like if you knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were</font>

421
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:38,950
for whatever reason using a range of

422
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,280
ports you could stick in a range here

423
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:47,440
also again acting like a CS nothing gets

424
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:50,149
through unless it's checked here so

425
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,710
so in this case let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of smtp</font>

426
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:53,149
because with this fixed IP address it

427
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:57,610
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really make sense we'll get rid</font>

428
00:17:53,149 --> 00:17:57,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one and go with this port range</font>

429
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,929
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you've added a little more</font>

430
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:08,419
complicated set of filters and in this

431
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:11,450
case let's do let's do also<font color="#E5E5E5"> add let's</font>

432
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:16,610
add like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> noir filter here so the idea</font>

433
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:24,859
in fact i'll add back 25 and if we do

434
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:27,229
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll put myself in here fbi.gov so</font>

435
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:29,330
in this case we added a coven or filter

436
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:32,600
so in this case or it collects<font color="#CCCCCC"> on this</font>

437
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:37,220
fixed IP this port range or on port 25

438
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:41,918
where the smtp address is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> thomas at</font>

439
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:44,509
FBI gov so give you an idea of kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

440
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:48,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">what had the ranges of what we might set</font>

441
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:51,440
it up to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright i mentioned limited</font>

442
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:54,918
tracking of dynamic you can use right

443
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:59,320
here we can track certain varieties of

444
00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:04,690
radius and ended in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dhcp type</font>

445
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,689
protocols to to track<font color="#E5E5E5"> for instance</font>

446
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:21,158
me logging in up and balance ring round

447
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:23,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">radius report sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

448
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:25,840
so I put in EM Thomas and now track

449
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,609
whenever I<font color="#CCCCCC"> login using that and get</font>

450
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,649
authentication to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network we would</font>

451
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:32,559
we would also not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this fixed</font>

452
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:37,748
range IP address but also watching for

453
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:39,249
logins and on the radius so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

454
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:40,720
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of gives you an idea of</font>

455
00:19:39,249 --> 00:19:45,580
some of the things it does there's other

456
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,259
things like the startup IPS here if the

457
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,119
targets online 24 hours a day and you

458
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:50,830
know he's online this moment we'll ask

459
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,209
the provider what IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address is you're</font>

460
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:57,908
currently using and they'll give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

461
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:59,830
us and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> put that in and then start</font>

462
00:19:57,909 --> 00:20:02,679
collecting instantly so that's what that

463
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:05,320
does there's a data text string here

464
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:12,460
sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> ominous basically that's to allow</font>

465
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:13,899
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to collect on port 80 but not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

466
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,909
webmail we're very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very rarely</font>

467
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:17,619
interested in I mean web traffic not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

468
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:19,690
which are very very uninterested

469
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:21,668
normally in people's web browsing what

470
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:23,919
we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested is their webmail so</font>

471
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:28,269
the data text string allows us to go in

472
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:31,720
put in a unique filter or unique string

473
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:35,139
user identification stirring that's used

474
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,779
in a couple of the significant varieties

475
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:40,418
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> web mail you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can imagine but I won't</font>

476
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:42,340
use me names<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can eliminate all</font>

477
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:45,580
web traffic all port 80 traffic except

478
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:50,289
that to and from your user with that

479
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:53,978
particular web mail in it so so you see

480
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:57,309
you have a very complicated set of ands

481
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:59,349
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ORS real quick i'll go to version 2</font>

482
00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:03,249
20 because everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinks it's much</font>

483
00:20:59,349 --> 00:21:07,450
more ominous and just show you that the

484
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:11,879
difference is you got a logical

485
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,879
structure so i can add<font color="#E5E5E5"> a filter</font>

486
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:24,020
that says fixed IP address again I can

487
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:28,370
set to i can say data from the IP

488
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:30,110
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address or both and I</font>

489
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,860
say okay and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I end up now with start to</font>

490
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:35,860
build a logical more of a logical

491
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,860
structure

492
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:50,590
so again does the same thing it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

493
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,389
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> logical the other</font>

494
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:58,750
thing this allows you to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is add not</font>

495
00:21:52,390 --> 00:22:01,030
so if you wanted to add in a certain IP

496
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:04,090
address that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you knew belong to</font>

497
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:07,300
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was totally uninteresting</font>

498
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,949
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone and you know ecommerce sites</font>

499
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,360
may be very common<font color="#CCCCCC"> with newspaper sites</font>

500
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:12,190
who wants to see a guy check its stock

501
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,559
updates 50 times a day if you're very

502
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,240
interested in only<font color="#CCCCCC"> the evidence of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

503
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,460
crime you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not interested in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

504
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,670
we can we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> add not filters</font>

505
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,110
in there so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can start to add</font>

506
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:26,170
filters and advil just so you're fairly

507
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:28,090
complicated string of what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

508
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,830
in fact you can call you know you can

509
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:33,580
pretty much narrow it down to a single a

510
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:35,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">single session going through that's the</font>

511
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea I think any question I'm glad to</font>

512
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,220
take questions here while this is up if

513
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:47,760
anybody wants to ask we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to way to</font>

514
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:47,760
lean good<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right had your chance</font>

515
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,470
next thing I want to do because it was

516
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,710
in the press we haven't talked a lot

517
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:59,050
about the the back end of this process

518
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,600
because no one asks any questions about

519
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,919
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we haven't made any effort not to</font>

520
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,379
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it something it's not</font>

521
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:09,670
classified not secret not particularly

522
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:11,470
spookier ominous but the back end of

523
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,970
this is what you do to process and look

524
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:15,010
at this date I mean when we collect<font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font>

525
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,560
as anybody knows here it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> native form</font>

526
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:19,420
it's just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP packets dumped on</font>

527
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,450
a date on a disk there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

528
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:24,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">overhead to tell us you know time stamps</font>

529
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:26,080
and name a file and things like that

530
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,230
just kind of set it up so we know what

531
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,210
it is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at it later but</font>

532
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:33,790
without some device in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use</font>

533
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,990
thing called packet ear you're not going

534
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,250
to be able to reconstruct it and I can

535
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,140
able to look at it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of</font>

536
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,820
jumbled information anybody's ever

537
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,980
looked at a hex dump obviously knows

538
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,710
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way you want untrained</font>

539
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,720
people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pore through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information it</font>

540
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,440
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for tech people maybe but</font>

541
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,690
they're looking for particular

542
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,490
information is it's terrible if your

543
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,230
obligation is to look at all the

544
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,930
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and understand it which is</font>

545
00:23:53,230 --> 00:24:01,630
what our obligation is so an idea here

546
00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:04,450
is a device that just simply takes in

547
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,190
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll put the whole folder in it</font>

548
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:09,010
takes in any data<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we might this is</font>

549
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,840
all test data that we've collected and

550
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:13,570
you hit the big run button again we try

551
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,159
to make it as simple as we can and it's

552
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:18,340
just reconstructing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets you know</font>

553
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:21,250
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks just like any application would</font>

554
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,120
do it tries to recognize which sessions

555
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,410
belong together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put them all back</font>

556
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,449
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it tries to write them</font>

557
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:28,270
as files and then it builds links that's

558
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:30,130
the one extra thing it does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> builds</font>

559
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:33,490
links to all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those and puts it in</font>

560
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:36,820
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I'm calling out 38 directory</font>

561
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:38,920
and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does that is so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

562
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,820
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can very easily with a browser</font>

563
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,820
essentially

564
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,870
point to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> link file and have all the</font>

565
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:49,820
information we need to to go back and

566
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at that now those of you that got a</font>

567
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:55,460
chance to listen to mark yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

568
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,260
and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't I'll tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you we're</font>

569
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,520
obligated when we do electronic

570
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,640
surveillance to look at what we

571
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,820
intercept and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason is even though</font>

572
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,980
we've intercepted it that doesn't mean

573
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,450
necessarily that there's any reason to

574
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,950
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's criminal there's</font>

575
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,690
certainly no reason for us to disclose

576
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,400
it to anyone so we're under this

577
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,890
information gets sealed one<font color="#CCCCCC"> obligation</font>

578
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,750
to protect it we can look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

579
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:20,450
a very first time we look at it we make

580
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:22,040
a cut a decision is it is it relevant to

581
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,500
the crime is it relevant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this or</font>

582
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:26,510
court order that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at and</font>

583
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:30,200
should be included in the order or is it

584
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:31,850
not if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we basically dispose of</font>

585
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,980
it now we throw nothing away as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

586
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,570
imagine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we seal it and give and</font>

587
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,150
present to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the court the court orders</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

588
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:40,669
sealed so we don't look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it again our</font>

589
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,740
investigators don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get access to it and</font>

590
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:45,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we keep which is a very small</font>

591
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,030
subset of what we may have to intercept

592
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,590
is what's relevant discussions of

593
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:50,800
criminal activity for instance or

594
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,760
discussions of who your criminal

595
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,190
conspirators are those sorts of things

596
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,860
we keep those are moved on to the

597
00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:00,200
investigator to use as they see fit to

598
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,760
conduct the investigation in doing that

599
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,270
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine if you're listening</font>

600
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,520
with earphones on a telephone<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it's</font>

601
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:10,370
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple guys talking about criminal</font>

602
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,100

603
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:15,739
turn it off that's the way we do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

604
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,570
much a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> process here because</font>

605
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,160
the internet really is a batch type

00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:22,189
communication particularly things like

607
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,590
email and because it takes processing to

608
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:26,990
understand what's going on with our got

609
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:28,790
a situation here where it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>

post process but they still follow that

611
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:32,930
rule we look at the data if it's

612
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:36,950
relevant we keep it if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we fill</font>

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the court and it goes away in</font>

00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,460
order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that you've got to have a</font>

615
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,870
way to actually look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all of the data</font>

616
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:45,830
you're obligated to look through all of

617
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:48,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and this is the tool which we use</font>

618
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:52,580
cool minor and just so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

619
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:53,810
defense is also able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get access to</font>

620
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,490
the same data

inkay an event<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring this to it</font>

622
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:00,380
to a trial and they would use a very

00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:04,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar device or this very device to</font>

624
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,960
look at the data themselves and the

625
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:10,420
first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do is tell it to process</font>

626
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,420
what we've what we've reconstructed

627
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:18,620
there's the pointer to the input<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

628
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:23,200
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll submit it and it's just going</font>

629
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:25,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the reconstruction programs a</font>

630
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,530
pointer file and rebuilding the pointers

631
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:30,020
and putting a summary building summary

632
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:32,330
screen and that's that's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

633
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">now this case I used a lot of intercept</font>

634
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:35,899
tests we normally<font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't see people</font>

635
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,540
using you know AOL Instant Messenger

telling you may or may not in one file

638
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,860
so I've used about 15 different files

639
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:48,320
here just to show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it would do</font>

640
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,550
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case it tells the monitor</font>

641
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,080
who's sitting you're looking at this the

642
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">first person the only person who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets</font>

644
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:59,570
and he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at it he says well you</font>

645
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:03,260
know there's eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> web pages here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> click</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">address is to and from the start times</font>

648
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:14,380
and stop times and in the file size poor

649
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,660
excuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> me could you go back us right</font>

650
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:20,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">where do we go back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to right here yeah I</font>

651
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:22,850
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that you had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> h323 protocols</font>

652
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,590
down there yeah so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to having</font>

653
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:27,199
access to a specific portion of the

654
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:29,629
network you also need access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the alg</font>

655
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:33,040
that cooperates with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT in order to</font>

00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:36,530
get the in downstream location for the

00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:38,090
h.323 keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind that made me out</font>

658
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,490
between the keep in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind what what this</font>

659
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:44,000
device does is it's ignorant of what was

660
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:45,410
collecting it so carnivore is one device

661
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,380
that could collect and feed information

662
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,610
into packaging to the cool minor but

663
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,200
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other ways of us getting data</font>

664
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:54,229
it could be handed to us by a service

665
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,380
provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could be collected off of a</font>

666
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,940
TCP dump type function it could be

667
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,820
collected off of a modem actually

668
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,770
demodulating a modem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's probably</font>

669
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:04,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">more common where we'd be demodulating</font>

670
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:07,269
modem where we would

671
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:09,220
we get the whole data stream because it

672
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:10,509
has to be on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> modem so there's a lot</font>

673
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where data might flow</font>

674
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:15,940
to carnivore that carnivore I mean the

675
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:18,879
two cool minor that carnival or may

676
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,649
actually not be capable<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing but</font>

677
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:22,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">they speak carnival all until me ask the</font>

678
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:23,979
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> directly then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is carnivore</font>

679
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:25,870
capable of working with an

683
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,820
cardboard can do now is passively sniff

684
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:38,580
what it knows and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell you</font>

685
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:44,259
right now it's very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> limited and</font>

686
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:48,129
what we what it knows example is if it

687
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:49,600
knows that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a user is using a specific as</font>

688
00:29:48,129 --> 00:29:51,610
you can sniff that and it'll get

689
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,709
everything on that link to<font color="#CCCCCC"> and from that</font>

690
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:55,689
address but it can't interact in any way

691
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:58,119
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network to get more information</font>

692
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:00,700
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now well that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not true you've</font>

693
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:03,820

the association between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> radius</font>

00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:11,679
servers information and what the the end

697
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,299
user gets you have to have some

698
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,769
interaction with the radius<font color="#E5E5E5"> server well</font>

699
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:17,320
I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> call an interaction there is</font>

700
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:19,960
a passive if that message<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

701
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,759
passively there it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can work can't did it</font>

702
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,519
now that's one of the issues that's a

703
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,440
good point if a lot of radio serves you

704
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:27,909
know aren't used obviously they're used

705
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,610
differently and that information<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's</font>

706
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:31,749
not there we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it and that's one</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons we work with service</font>

708
00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:36,759
providers to find out how how is your

709
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:38,259
network working what's there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,830
think one of the questions that's in the

00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,899
back of the minds of a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

717
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:55,480
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> M bone my name is Ted</font>

718
00:30:52,899 --> 00:30:58,119
party and I work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> equinix is what</font>

719
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,730
devices on the network of an Internet

720
00:30:58,119 --> 00:31:04,029
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider do you have any active</font>

721
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:06,429
interaction with and I'm hearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say</font>

722
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:08,830
there are no devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a network that</font>

723
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:10,090
you have active interaction with is that

724
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,809
a true statement or am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I miss hearing</font>

725
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:14,949
you are with carnivore<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is true</font>

726
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:15,740
obviously if we don't use carnivore<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

727
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:18,040
might be different

728
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:21,140
but with carnivore that's true now i

729
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:24,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">could let me pop back real quick to a to</font>

730
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:26,900
a screen here the reality of how we set

731
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:29,420
this up is it gets a little complicated

732
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:33,740
and because we rely on service providers

733
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:35,900
to show us where connect believe it or

734
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:37,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">not we don't go in like you see on</font>

735
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,200
television and say you know out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

736
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:40,399
way this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my operation we don't have</font>

737
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:50,660
the knowledge obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your</font>

738
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:54,800
networks to do that yeah hello yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

739
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:57,230
love computers really I'll give you a

740
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,120
quick quick idea I lived<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so any</font>

741
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:03,320
actually assert that your claim<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

742
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,870
never come in and say I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to insert</font>

743
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,428
this box in your network without

744
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:10,280
coordinating with the service provider

745
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:12,740
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> plain false because the service</font>

746
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:15,980
provider that I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work for had the</font>

747
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:19,600
phenomenon happen that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FBI without a</font>

748
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:22,750
court order forced a cable technician in

749
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:25,550
Comcast's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Maryland to insert a hub</font>

750
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:29,720
that was not in fact able able to do

751
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:31,790
full duplex into my network to connect

752
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,490
to the machine that only worked full

753
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:36,590
duplex and caused a major outage<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

754
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:39,320
company I used to work for so that claim

755
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:40,790
is just plain false actually we're in a

756
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,620
good situation here you happen to have

757
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:44,690
in front of you the one person in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

758
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,760
room<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knows what he's trying to talk</font>

759
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:51,010
about and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get to tell you that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

760
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,010
true it's not true come on back up

761
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:57,270
let me be clear that absolutely happens

762
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:59,190
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will sign an affidavit that had</font>

763
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:01,110
happened and there are other witnesses

764
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:04,410
that had happened and ultimately what

765
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:06,510
happened was our legal counsel called

766
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:09,000
the FBI<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was two and a half years</font>

767
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:12,600
old so a three-day carnivore but it

768
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,390
absolutely did occur I didn't got room

769
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,820
who know me personally to know that I'm

770
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:19,049
credible on this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> graduated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you who are</font>

771
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,330
in here and know where I used to work

772
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:23,429
you know which particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP this</font>

773
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:26,780
happened to and our security manager

774
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:29,580
went semi nonlinear when this happen

775
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:32,399
yeah but then in fact calm down enough

776
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:34,230
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> call people he knowed FBI and we also</font>

777
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,210
actually pointed out to the cable

778
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:38,640
operator that they were in violation of

779
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:40,799
statute because<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable operators have</font>

780
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,090
additional set of statutes prohibiting

781
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,720
them from collecting data about

782
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:47,970
subscriber traffic and so so don't go

783
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,159
making bold claims that are in fact not

784
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,659
factual<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay listen I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not the one</font>

785
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,190
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> bold claims he look I didn't come</font>

786
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:57,000
here to fight with you people I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

787
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:59,190
didn't I promise you I did not but sorry

788
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,630
a bold claim is we never interfere with

789
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:03,659
nike's network without their permission

790
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:08,879
that's a bold claim it's also false okay

791
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:10,740
stand by I didn't say an ISP notice and

792
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,418
network operator first of all now listen

793
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:15,899
let me let me again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did not come here</font>

794
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:19,408
to fight well not all not all operators

795
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:21,210
are ESPYs right I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're well they</font>

796
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:22,980
may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> but not everybody is an idea</font>

797
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,780
they're not to me so let me let me go

798
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,090
back that event did occur but not

799
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,399
exactly as you as you remember it or

800
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,889
what was relayed to you first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all</font>

801
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:33,690
I'll tell you there was a court order

802
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:35,639
there was a court order there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always a</font>

803
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:38,940
court order in a case where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do this</font>

804
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:40,169
the very rare exception would be like i

805
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,280
said if there were permission but we

806
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:42,899
would not go to a service provider

807
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,179
there's no way we would go to a service

808
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:47,190
provider expect them to respond to a

809
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:48,690
case where they were asking permission

810
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:50,790
for a victim unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean unless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

811
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:54,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">were bit so it just doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen that</font>

812
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:58,190
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a court order secondly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

813
00:34:54,590 --> 00:35:01,030
don't know how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that is still</font>

814
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:03,670
sealed or not but i can tell you this

815
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:05,500
I agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you there was a complex</font>

816
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,530
relationship in that case between the

817
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet service provider and the person</font>

818
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,680
who had physical control over the

819
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,180
equipment and ran the equipment own

820
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,549
equipment so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a little</font>

821
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated and that was something that</font>

822
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:22,090
this cable operator in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this particular</font>

823
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,160
case took a responsibility for so it's

824
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:25,360
complicated situation but the bottom

825
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,799
line is and I'll show you right here

826
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:35,620
what happened in that case we rely on

827
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:36,970
oops let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me get back we rely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on this</font>

828
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:39,880
part right here where I say segment from

829
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:42,189
isp we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't just go in and say here you</font>

830
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">know hook it up because you have to know</font>

831
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:47,350
where to hook it so we normally always

832
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:49,030
we're relying on the ISP You operator

833
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:50,259
Hoover you<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it the technical people</font>

834
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:55,360
who understand the architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

835
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:57,430
network to pinpoint<font color="#CCCCCC"> the connection where</font>

836
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,800
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be installed and in the</font>

837
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:01,720
particular case of that one and in

838
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,930
almost every case very<font color="#E5E5E5"> often the ice P</font>

839
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,890
will configure a connection now in this

840
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">case you're right there was a</font>

841
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:08,680
complication there where the ISP was

842
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:10,330
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things they weren't authorized to</font>

843
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,859
do under the<font color="#CCCCCC"> agreement with their</font>

844
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:14,730
company that's true we didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

845
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:20,860
bit was happening but they did configure

846
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:23,380
that link using a router that wasn't

847
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:25,750
full duplex on a full duplex lon and I

848
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,460
be honest with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you my technician told</font>

849
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,750
the guy it wouldn't work and he said no

850
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,400
it'll work don't worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and we</font>

851
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,900
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> them hook it up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we plugged into</font>

852
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,980
it's all we did is plug into the router

853
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,980
I mean the hub

854
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,770
well I'm gonna tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what I'm going</font>

855
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:00,569
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on because I'm not interested</font>

856
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,710
I'll be glad to say you want to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

857
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:03,690
I'll sit down<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you and we can talk</font>

858
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,849
about it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to sit here</font>

859
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,650
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you over it it's</font>

860
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,910
senseless to do that so let's don't

861
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,890
worry about that was other than to move

862
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:13,649
on to tell you people that what I had

863
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:16,529
intended to show and I apologize if if

864
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:18,599
you if you think that and I apologize if

865
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:20,549
in any way and I do know it did

866
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,440
interfere<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network I know it did and</font>

867
00:37:20,549 --> 00:37:24,990
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> apologized for that at the time we we</font>

868
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,460
removed that instantly when actually we

869
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,558
didn't we told him to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it not him but</font>

870
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,040
the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who calls to take it out</font>

871
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:33,390
immediately and we never reinstalled it

872
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,950
but it had nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with what we</font>

873
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,170
did it did have something to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with an</font>

874
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,669
attempt by the cable company to help us

875
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:41,369
implement a title three it certainly did

876
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:45,000
but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we did anything wrong</font>

877
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:47,609
in that case but the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> being that</font>

878
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,319
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> P has to usually work with us to</font>

879
00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:51,119
find the point to connect there's no

880
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:52,770
doubt about it and very often they do

881
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,710
things on the network to make that

882
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:59,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen most of them know exactly what</font>

883
00:37:55,710 --> 00:38:02,010
they're doing and they cause no harm and

884
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:07,470
I we appreciate that that kind of effort

885
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:09,410
together let's go back to cool minor

886
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:13,709
real quick just to show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it does</font>

887
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:16,529
an example is a web traffic and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

888
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:20,130
click on on a particular link there's my

889
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:23,690
my splash screen another one might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

890
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:26,250
and it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same one sign one down here</font>

891
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:28,109
so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Errol's apologize for using</font>

892
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,510
anybody's connect anybody's actual name

893
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:33,660
but I happen to have had that screen

894
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:35,010
inside our<font color="#E5E5E5"> chest network it's probably</font>

895
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:39,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">some good advertising I don't know maybe</font>

896
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:44,099
it's been good by the way FBI's not in

897
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:49,680
any way looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at arrows like other</font>

898
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:53,730
things again telnet yeah you can look at

899
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,549
telnet and you know step through the

900
00:38:53,730 --> 00:39:00,930
twos and the fronds on a telnet session

901
00:38:56,549 --> 00:39:03,839
just something basically so a user I say

902
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:06,210
user a monitor can look at this data

903
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,558
without a hex dump you know XO editor

904
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:10,410
can look at it and actually see what it

905
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:12,720
is and then they mark it for to keep or

906
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:16,680
don't keep that type of thing and that's

907
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:20,879
and that's what this this project does

908
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:22,230
or this product if if this was not full

909
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,970
content intercept if we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin</font>

910
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,680
register obviously when you click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

911
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:27,299
link you wouldn't get the content you

912
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,690
just simply get the to the from IP

913
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:32,759
address in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular case of a web</font>

914
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:34,619
of web traffic there was smtp you get

915
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,750
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the order said the two</font>

916
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:40,500
and the from address and the IP

917
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:41,849
addresses now<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I go I want to jump</font>

918
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,380
to mark a can wire real quick there was

919
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:48,270
a legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> question it came up in that last</font>

920
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:51,660
argument it internet a fight over this

921
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:53,400
but the gentleman in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back was very</font>

922
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:55,890
excited made reference to a statute that

923
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,380
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> claimed prohibited cable providers</font>

924
00:39:55,890 --> 00:40:00,660
from providing information without

925
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,369
notice their subscribers in fact I think

926
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,529
if you check the legislative history of

927
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:07,049
that that statute was amended in 1992 a

928
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:08,880
little involved but like Marcus I'm had

929
00:40:07,049 --> 00:40:10,530
to talk to you about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in fact makes</font>

930
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,069
clear that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to give notice</font>

931
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:15,960
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> object of a title three order if</font>

932
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:17,819
you're a cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> company Congress</font>

933
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,650
specifically for saw that problem so

934
00:40:17,819 --> 00:40:21,660
just narrow point you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a</font>

935
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,930
carnivore markets a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

936
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,940
here all right

937
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:27,578
yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit more</font>

938
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:30,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the technical side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I note that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

939
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:31,839
guys are using radius tracking to you

940
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:35,530
know follow specific target in the event

941
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:37,240
of basically a dynamic<font color="#CCCCCC"> environment given</font>

942
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:41,010
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of us are running large</font>

943
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:44,200
distributed authentication environment I

944
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:45,700
sort of wonder basically the practical

945
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,368
use of that is there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> there any plans</font>

946
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:50,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to expand carnivore to be a distributed</font>

947
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:52,390
system to allow you to track across

948
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,859
multiple sites because that's the only

949
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,779
way I can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> being effective in</font>

950
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:58,058
large portion of our networks right

951
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,280
that's a good question of the real

952
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:03,059
answer is simple no there's no plans and

953
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:07,390
it has a limited application carnivore

954
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:08,619
was designed and not by the way just

955
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,930
getting back to that other argument

956
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:12,670
before that actually happened there was

957
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:15,730
no carnivore when that happened so

958
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:17,619
carnivores is since that time looking at

959
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:19,839
18<font color="#E5E5E5"> months to two years really that's</font>

960
00:41:17,619 --> 00:41:21,430
been usable it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just a tool</font>

961
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,799
designed for what we were seeing at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

962
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:28,540
time and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most part that was it</font>

963
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:32,650
was and has been small ISPs running for

964
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:35,049
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> part you know in a in a single</font>

965
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,910
link type of environment now we're

966
00:41:35,049 --> 00:41:38,259
seeing changes obviously we're beginning

967
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,598
to rely more and more on the network

968
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,160
operators capabilities to do some of

969
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:45,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">that stuff but no the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

970
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:49,029
carnivore is kind of a limited unique

971
00:41:45,609 --> 00:41:51,160
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of application tool it will</font>

972
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:53,200
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> die a fairly quick death at</font>

973
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:56,589
some point as things continue technology

974
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,118
continues to to really outpace it you

975
00:41:56,589 --> 00:42:00,940
know we'll go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the tool bag for</font>

977
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:06,790
hope is that those tools are you know as

much part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the commercial environment</font>

or the non-government toolboxes as there

are<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours so long answer but no thank</font>

hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean down Equinix my question is</font>

983
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:30,430
probably more directed to mark but since

<font color="#CCCCCC">exchange points where the demarcation</font>

988
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,410
between providers is extremely fuzzy and

00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:47,020
the ownership of the experience point

990
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:50,980
network versus the provider network is

991
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:56,259
also frequently fuzzy how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide</font>

00:42:50,980 --> 00:43:00,070
upon whom to serve the order in an

coast is operated by NASA government

1006
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:35,020
agency are the world's different because

1007
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:38,250
it's a government agency operating the

1008
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:41,250
exchange point versus commercial carrier

1009
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,250
now

safe people seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gotten hung up</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in the idea of whether or not we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1013

trust the FBI<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to do anything</font>

1014
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:58,500
nefarious and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not saying that's not</font>

1015
00:43:54,270 --> 00:44:01,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">a issue to be concerned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about but what</font>

1016
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,520
I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to know is these carnival boxes</font>

1017

accessible remotely by any means they

just a dialing you know plain old

<font color="#E5E5E5">something different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like an ISDN or</font>

outside is one as an operational need

00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:47,820
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working a case and</font>

1035
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,220
you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for information it's</font>

1036
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:52,470
critical like when somebody's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

be killed or when some load of books a

<font color="#CCCCCC">want to regularly get access to data</font>

1041
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:02,129
where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FBI culture we used to</font>

1042
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:04,349
listening to people real time as they

1043
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:06,210
speak and we can't have that here so we

1044
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:08,880
have to have a method for being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

1045
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:11,040
very quickly see once an hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> once every</font>

1046
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,270
two hours check that pull it down look

1047
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,759
at it see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's anything going on</font>

1048
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:16,980
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> party yo you as a limited</font>

1049
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,619
amount of storage space on a removable

1050
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,940
drive so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it see if</font>

1051
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:24,480
it's time to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick the thing up</font>

1052
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:26,910
physically and then third sometimes the

1053
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,170
parameters of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> order change</font>

1054
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:33,930
you add targets once the orders sign and

1055
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:36,480
it's served all you have to do is access

1056
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:38,069
that and change the filter<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we don't</font>

1057
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,170
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our field agents going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out and</font>

1058
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:42,300
doing that so that would be done from a

1059
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:44,460
central location so it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be that</font>

1060
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:47,670
sure that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> very reasonable I just</font>

1061
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:50,550
my concern is you have you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

1062
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:52,770
putting capability to monitor a huge

1063
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:55,050
range of information whether or not you

1064
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:56,609
actually do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as of course case by</font>

1065
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:58,260
case and what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to do but</font>

1066
00:45:56,609 --> 00:45:59,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're putting that facility in there so</font>

1067
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,470
there's somebody were to gain

1068
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:03,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">unauthorized access to the carnival box</font>

1069
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:06,240
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to gain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access to a</font>

1070
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:08,310
lot of private<font color="#CCCCCC"> information that nobody</font>

1071
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,950
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at is there any way</font>

1072
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:13,770
that you somebody could compromise a

1073
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:16,140
carnival box uh well certainly I mean

1074
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:20,369
it's vulnerable physically where it sits

1075
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:22,109
we rely upon there's no there's no FBI

1076
00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:24,300
presence where it sits in the network so

1077
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:28,770
that we rely<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the ISP security now</font>

1078
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:30,510
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ISP has a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more capable</font>

1079
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:32,160
and dangerous tools sitting around in

1080
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:33,510
sales and generally they could do

1081
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,819
similar things so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not worried</font>

1082
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:37,730
about about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their security we pretty</font>

1083
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:40,980
much trust obviously trust them to

1084
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:43,290
secure our device<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like all the rest</font>

1085
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,270
of their devices so there's physical

1086
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:47,910
security there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> four dial-in it depends</font>

1087
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:51,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">on how secure you want to go but there</font>

1088
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:53,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">is there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a device a hardware firmware</font>

1089
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:56,820
you know device on the line that

1090
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:59,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">attempts to block unauthorized college</font>

1091
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:01,050
from coming in we've evaluated it but we

1092
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:03,599
haven't evaluated<font color="#E5E5E5"> exhaustively i hope</font>

1093
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:05,070
this carnival review will be in part an

1094
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,050
exhaustive review of the security

1095
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:08,880
question because we don't know well

1096
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:10,800
obviously we don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put this in</font>

1097
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,589
there and then have bad guys dialing

1098
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,510
into it how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> choti be ridiculous now</font>

1099
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:17,970
some carriers choose to disconnect it

1100
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:19,650
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine we would call them up</font>

1101
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:21,689
and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm about to dial in could you</font>

1102
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:23,940
connect it and they'll do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

1103
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:25,859
works it annoys obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> noise people</font>

1104
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:28,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes if they have we call them a</font>

1105
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:31,529
lot but that could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> one way of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

1106
00:47:28,589 --> 00:47:35,089
and we do that occasional thank you

1107
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:40,320
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elliot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lira cisco systems so</font>

1108
00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:42,180
several times you mentioned we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

1109
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:45,210
talking about the analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> package</font>

1110
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:48,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">here how you know it has the ability to</font>

1111
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:53,310
manage or to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1112
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:55,350
streams like Ted was talking about h.323

1113
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:56,700
and you mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that carnivore</font>

1114
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:59,310
doesn't have really the capability to

1115
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:02,240
put that stuff to get to do much with

1116
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:06,180
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> today so my only question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you is</font>

1117
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:09,089
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> using data sources other than</font>

1118
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:10,890
carnivore when you say data<font color="#E5E5E5"> source is</font>

1119
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:12,810
you talking about we do we take data

1120
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:15,120
into this process from things out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1121
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:18,870
sure the rumble warriors have their own

1122
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:22,470
systems some ISPs are their own systems

1123
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:24,000
some use for the particular application

1124
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:25,859
maybe some have already done some things

1125
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they're the victim you could you</font>

1126
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:29,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">could put TCB dumps an example you can</font>

1127
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:32,490
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that data in here there are devices</font>

1128
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:36,990
for doing intercepts on modems<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked</font>

1129
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:39,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">about we can we can take those in but 40</font>

1130
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:40,229
and also you know another protocol

1131
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,480
analyzer commercial off-the-shelf

1132
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:45,660
protocol analyzers could be used that

1133
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,270
their output could flow into that so but

1134
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:50,970
carnivores the only product we design

1135
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:56,790
and build to do internet type sniffing

1136
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:58,109
at an ISP network<font color="#E5E5E5"> right Brooklyn arson</font>

1137
00:48:56,790 --> 00:49:01,050
it's actually two questions the first

1138
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:02,040
question you say you have a phone line

1139
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:05,010
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can connect whose</font>

1140
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:09,120
responsibility is that to provide online

1141
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:10,920
mmm well<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's our responsibility we pay</font>

1142
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:12,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I could be a</font>

1143
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,680
facility<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy that usually</font>

1144
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,270
ends up having to put that stuff

1145
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,669
together the other question what

1146
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:19,590
assurances we do do we have from the FBI

1147
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:22,710
that when you dial in you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1148
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:25,110
change the monitoring parameters good

1149
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,310
good question and I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> point out</font>

1150
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:29,640
that's one of the distinctions between

1151
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:31,830
version 134 I showed in 201 what 134

1152
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,080
does is when you want to when a user

1153
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:35,730
dials in or initially set it up when

1154
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,600
they hit the Go button actually when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1155
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:41,040
hit the Save button it saves a log file

1156
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:43,170
and when you get to hit the Go button it

1157
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,570
starts collecting it<font color="#CCCCCC"> writes to the log</font>

1158
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:48,870
file so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a log file that shows</font>

1159
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:50,730
how the filter was set up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1160
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:54,330
that sort of thing who you can check to

1161
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:56,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">see who logged in to do that once we</font>

1162
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:59,400
leave and remotely dial back in make any

1163
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:02,010
changes all that stool on a log file so

1164
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,050
there's an auditing capability using the

1165
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:06,910
log file<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I hope that's all well and</font>

1166
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:10,480
good but do we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that well</font>

1167
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:12,399
question and the answer is yes you do in

1168
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain circumstances you as a member of</font>

1169
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">the public would not are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you as an ISP</font>

1170
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:19,410
may or may not but the information is

1171
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:21,700
stored with the actual intercepted data

1172
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:27,339
and becomes a part of the court<font color="#CCCCCC"> record</font>

1173
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:29,950
so it's available to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> a criminal</font>

1174
00:50:27,339 --> 00:50:32,170
subject who was indicted if this

1175
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:33,910
information is evidentiary he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1176
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:36,039
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> log information well</font>

1177
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:39,368
you'll pardon my paranoia when it comes

1178
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:40,960
to the FBI but as our steamed colleague

1179
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:42,760
down here pointed out you guys aren't

1180
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:48,579
exactly the most trustworthy individuals

1181
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:51,160
on the planet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I fail to see where I mean</font>

1182
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:52,839
I come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from an ISP it's very common to</font>

1183
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,520
write back doors into stuff so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1184
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:56,200
can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> modifications without anybody</font>

1185
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,759

1188
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:04,990
part i think the department justice took

1189
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:07,839
up the independent review to just take a

1190

know the machines sitting there

1194
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:17,259
connected the network what's to stop me

1195
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:18,910
from having another device loaded on

1196
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:21,670
another piece of software absolutely

1197
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:24,279
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the answer I think is about</font>

1198
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:25,960
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated but it gets down</font>

1199
00:51:24,279 --> 00:51:27,430
to why you know that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not out</font>

1200
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,049
listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your phone calls at the</font>

1203
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:37,589
I can tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I imagine after</font>

1204
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:37,589
this conversation you might be

00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:46,449
what is the name again so everyone stand

healthy skepticism of the government

1208
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:53,169
activity is absolutely essential and we

1209
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:54,819
we appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and understand it but</font>

1210
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:55,900
there are laws in place to prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

from doing and I'll to tell you I'm a

absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> could but they could also</font>

plant evidence at a crime scene and they

1218
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:15,819
can intercept phone call them that are

up there's a legal I'm sorry I didn't do

1221

 being there's all's in place to

1222

prevent<font color="#E5E5E5"> us from doing it also it's not</font>

00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:28,299
simple to carry one of these out<font color="#CCCCCC"> is as</font>

00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:30,339
we talked and argued and fought even

here it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

clerk it's not not normally done it we

1229
00:52:37,089 --> 00:52:41,349
can't be done that way obviously the

1230
00:52:39,069 --> 00:52:42,549
department justice knows about it if

1231
00:52:41,349 --> 00:52:44,890
there's a if we're trying to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

knows about the two agencies are

1236
00:52:49,569 --> 00:52:53,589
involved our legal people know about it

1237
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:55,779
our investigators know about it and our

1238
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:57,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">technical people know about it and the</font>

1239
00:52:55,779 --> 00:53:00,729

levels the legal<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the technical and</font>

1243
00:53:04,959 --> 00:53:09,189
yeah you're right it sounds like

1244
00:53:07,299 --> 00:53:11,559
something that would be very easy and it

1245
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:15,549
could happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reality is to pull</font>

with the extraordinarily complex to a

lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know about it mark to that</font>

1249
00:53:21,759 --> 00:53:27,150
as well Marcus I don't know how much you

is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the way not to have</font>

an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP we provide much more information</font>

1285
00:55:04,249 --> 00:55:07,098
about what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and I'm able to</font>

1286
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:10,730
provide here or that we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:13,549
provide it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> response to ethics for</font>

1288
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:16,130
your request working with a particular

1289
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:18,799
isp we don't hold back anything we tell

1290
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:20,509
exactly what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> but again the</font>

1291
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:22,279
order requires that they not talk about

1292
00:55:20,509 --> 00:55:24,140
that now I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start that fight all</font>

1293
00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:25,430
over again<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was three years ago and</font>

1294
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:30,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm here now and I'm telling you we do</font>

1295
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:33,288
that now but the reason we don't provide

1296
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:35,239
the source code for example or more

1297
00:55:33,289 --> 00:55:38,089
information is that it's our opinion

1298
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:41,450
that that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an improvement thing</font>

1299
00:55:38,089 --> 00:55:43,519
to FBI do given that is our job among

1300
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:47,839
other things to enforce electronic

1301
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:52,640
surveillance violations but also to turn

1302
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:55,220
over a tool to anybody that could be

1303
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:57,049
used to violate the law would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font>

1304
00:55:55,220 --> 00:56:01,700
prudent we don't sell guns for instance

1305
00:55:57,049 --> 00:56:03,079
as the FBI we could we don't so I think

1306
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:06,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think there's even a federal law</font>

1307
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:07,849
against that right now so we don't we

1308
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,200
don't do that so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean basically that</font>

1309
00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:13,720
deal we don't need to be prudent for us

1310
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:16,308
to to make that capability available

1311
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,410
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of call on clearly</font>

1312
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:22,940
two last questions or that issue in the

1313
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:24,410
last question you stated this several

1314
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:27,230
times right basically that you don't

1315
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:30,330
want to go to jail for doing illegal

1316
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:31,920
wiretap yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know right</font>

1317
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:34,170
when he wouldn't you feel a lot more

1318
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,180
comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the determination of</font>

1319
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:38,100
whether you were doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that or not was</font>

1320
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:41,279
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands of experts in the courts</font>

1321
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:43,740
rather than any hacker who really feels

1322
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:46,980
like decompiling the source and trying

1323
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:50,310
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out from a decompile I mean</font>

1324
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:52,260
decompiling that the object sure I yeah

1325
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:53,970
you know it is a good argument there's

1326
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:56,700
good arguments about that bottom line is

1327
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:59,790
is the process will have to stand the

1328
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:01,200
test ultimately in court I mean it's

1329
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:03,540
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> being looked at by this</font>

1330
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,899
independent review that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing but</font>

1331
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:08,400
in and ultimately it will have to stand

1332
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:10,740
the test in court at some point the

1333
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,150
judge a judge is going to say how<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

1334
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">you collect this information you got to</font>

1335
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:18,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer for that and it's up to him as to</font>

1336
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:20,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">what detail he allows to be discussed</font>

1337
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,430
and I tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1338
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:26,690
excruciating<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee low-level details so we</font>

1339
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:30,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no doubt that this will be</font>

1340
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:32,160
evaluated in very detailed great detail

1341
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:33,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">ultimately because to do it in a public</font>

1342
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,029
forum we consider to be more dangerous

1343
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:39,270
than productive that's a call that we've

1344
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:41,430
made I think our judges agreed with us

1345
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:42,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">on it so I it's you know we had to</font>

1346
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:45,960
decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that that</font>

1347
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:48,509
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more dangerous than beneficial</font>

1348
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,610
I think I FPS might be just as concerned

1349
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:52,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the expertise of the court as the</font>

1350
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:56,520
veracity of law enforcement in escape

1351
00:57:52,880 --> 00:58:00,390
well I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even comment on</font>

1352
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:01,740
that one last question unfortunately but

1353
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:05,129
you can all email me feel free to email

1354
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:07,470
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call me I usually return phone</font>

1355
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,820
calls but I'm usually there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you not</font>

1356
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:11,669
get me God feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> free to call and talk</font>

1357
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:14,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it what are you doing cases where</font>

1358
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:17,100
the subject is using encryption non

1359
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:19,260
public key encryption well that's a good

1360
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:22,080
question before I say that let me get

1361
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:26,310
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> real quick to the to this point I</font>

1362
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:27,690
hit and hit it very hard what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 80%</font>

1363
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:29,220
of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've done with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> carnival has</font>

1364
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:30,930
been national security cases in not

1365
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:33,779
criminal cases just give you an idea of

1366
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:36,390
why we're a little sensitive about what

1367
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:38,490
we say and do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1368
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:41,000
particularly regard to carnivore nothing

1369
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:43,080
because it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't deal with that</font>

1370
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,140
encryption is a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem we</font>

1371
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:47,460
definitely recognize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> missile not</font>

1372
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:51,779
maybe not a problem for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all but it's</font>

1373
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:54,110
a partner so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is though this</font>

1374
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:56,190
device itself and its suite of devices

1375
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:58,440
really can't deal with it if you had

1376
00:58:56,190 --> 00:59:00,560
encrypted an attachment for instance you

1377
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:02,760
would see it literally as a jumbled mess

1378
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:04,440
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font>

1379
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,330
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now what percentage of your cases</font>

1380
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,820
would you say are thwarted by encryption

1381
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:10,680
I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that exact numbers right</font>

1382
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:12,360
now I can say that it's growing I can

1383
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:15,509
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's more common to find</font>

1384
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:18,270
encryption in cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we see static</font>

1385
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:19,890
data where someone's stored data on a

1386
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:21,990
hard drive for example we see that

1387
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,370
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something else is again not an</font>

1388
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:27,270
issue for carnivore but that's another

1389
00:59:23,370 --> 00:59:29,670
way we may get data much more common

1390
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:32,370
still probably in the low team that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1391
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:36,030
most percentages on the electronic

1392
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:38,790
surveillance side it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> rare for us</font>

1393
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:40,050
so but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know it's growing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

1394
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:42,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">starting to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the trend move up with</font>

1395
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:45,770
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much I</font>

1396
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,770
appreciate it
