00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:05,130
my pleasure<font color="#E5E5E5"> to introduce two of my</font>

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:08,459
colleagues<font color="#E5E5E5"> Craig</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lebovits</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and Navajo Joe</font>

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:16,440
and their slides as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be live</font>

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:17,460
momentarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> You Susan to</font>

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,060
begin<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have any food</font>

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,590
recommendations for you nor in this talk

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,150
are we going to talk about sniffing

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,849
anyone's network nothing that

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,848
controversial instead we'll talk about

10
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:33,570
injecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> faults into people's networks</font>

11
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:36,480
so a lot less controversial so wait just

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,430
a second is people come in but we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,559
talking this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a follow-on talk to our</font>

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,350
last nanog talk where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we said really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,230
things about PGP today we'll just say

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">really bad things about policy not so</font>

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,730
much about PGP this work is in

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,739
collaboration with abba as well as some

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:58,319

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,840

at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a theoretical point of</font>

38
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,320
view the answer is pretty bad it's n

39
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,990
factorial where n is the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

40

41
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,729
far worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> than rape or other protocols</font>

42
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:50,039
and we also presented quite a bit of

43
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,579
measured data looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> faults we had</font>

44
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,110
injected over the course of two years

45
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:57,929
where we looked at numbers ranging from

46
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,390
10 to 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes at the upper bound for</font>

48
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,439
throughout the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet so really big</font>

49
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,068
numbers from a theoretical point of view

50
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:11,549
n factorial states and from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> measured</font>

51
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:13,410
times up to half an hour but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it turns</font>

52
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,690
out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> practice the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

53
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,640
isn't a complete graph that providers

54
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,950
have the nasty habit of actually having

55
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,890
policies and filtering and filtering

56
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,540
customers so in practice we really don't

57
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,429
see the millions of updates we would

58
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,380
have predict predicted and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

59
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,390
because the internet isn't a nice

60
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,760
complete graph and there's policies and

61
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,279
other things in there so the question

62
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,070
we're looking at in this talk is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,290
what are really given the given given a

it about Internet policy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

68
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,750

69
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,820
convergence times after failure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

70
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,860
the time it takes for bgp messages to

different our state<font color="#E5E5E5"> to polity is</font>

76
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,860
different and is there anything we can

77
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,290
do to improve BGP convergence so rather

78
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">than hold everyone in suspense I'll give</font>

80
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:23,940
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe so we repeated some of the</font>

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,130
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar experiments we talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">of just looking at how a single fault</font>

84
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,480
propagated we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to simultaneously</font>

85
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,590
take different prefixes and failover and

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,170

different prefixes from the different

90
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,820
providers filtered through the network

91
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,430
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did this with some 30 different</font>

92
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,070
providers and we also had a number of

93
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,510
surveys were<font color="#E5E5E5"> khabar did to try to</font>

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,109
understand you know where does this path

something of someone else trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

99
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,870
understand what led to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the paths</font>

100
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,120
we observed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next couple of slides</font>

101
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,950
will focus on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> great mass of data we</font>

102
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,070
collected instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> focus on</font>

103
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,589
just a sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a case study of three</font>

104
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,940
providers we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick really to</font>

105
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,980
illustrate some of the intuition behind

106
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,890
this will talk about three providers all

107
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,919
that Mae West these three<font color="#E5E5E5"> providers are</font>

108
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:25,010
all direct peers of another provider who

109
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,710
is mainly located in Japan

110
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,659
so in steady state all direct peers all

111
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,630
the route always had to let a path of

112
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:34,670
length<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 all very similar when we did</font>

113
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,820
pings or trace routes also the results

114
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:41,120
were all very similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

115
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:43,550
again a graphical view of what I said we

116
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,040
had three providers all at Mae West took

117
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,780
three different prefixes we sent bgp

118
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,370
announcements and withdrawals for these

119
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,320
three different prefixes into the three

120
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,060
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> providers essentially watch</font>

121
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,700
what happened from the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> japanese</font>

122
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,190
provider in steady state again they're

123
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,099
all directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected so steady state</font>

124
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,170
looked exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> alike but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when we</font>

125
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually looked at the data measuring</font>

126
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,100
the convergence Layton sees that is from

127
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">the time it took when we injected a</font>

128
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,500
fault into is p 1 2<font color="#CCCCCC"> and 3 how long did</font>

129
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,780
it take<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the Japanese ISP to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reach</font>

130
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,180
convergence was all very different data

131
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,950
in fact it's much more pronounced when

132
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,560
you look at slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> newer graphs we</font>

133
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,360
have over longer data frames but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

134
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,660
turns out is<font color="#CCCCCC"> p1 in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isp two were close</font>

135
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,320
but I sp3 had much took much longer to

136
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:32,810
converge so initially is p1 and ice

137
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,810
before had direct peers when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually</font>

138
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,630
injected the faults about ninety six

139
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:41,720
percent of the time we see the backup

140
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:45,409
path and I'll have a little pointer here

141
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:48,110
we'd see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> s5s for backup path</font>

142
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:51,110
followed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> a withdraw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at an average</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

including the thing in green when we did

the study we notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a huge number</font>

of paths that made no sense we had you

know dear ones being customers of small

content providers who are then customers

00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:03,739
of other threats<font color="#CCCCCC"> picking very strange</font>

195
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:05,779
courses on one example we had two

routers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mae West who had a direct</font>

route between them when we failed that

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,360
path the route actually end up going

199
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:12,649
through several small Mediterranean

200
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,559
countries before it finally was

201
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:17,149
withdrawing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all these just really</font>

202
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:20,509
points the difficulty in getting these

203
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:22,099
filters right just in a huge number of

204
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,349
cases where just the filters were wrong

205
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:26,719
and when we finally asked the different

206
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:29,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISPs involved you know what why are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

207
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:33,019
transiting you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Italy the answer is</font>

208
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:34,308
of course always we aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when we</font>

209
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:36,639
showed them the data they said oh we

00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:36,639
shouldn't be

211
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:43,479
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> final example that I'm</font>

212
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,890
sorry no I don't I don't I don't work

question maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll yeah okay so this</font>

216
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,940
is the last example one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

217
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,890
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> you notice as I go through</font>

218
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,560
this example is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we move from a</font>

219
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:06,850
tier 1 to the tier 3 the topologies are

220
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,680
getting more complex not the

221
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,290
steady-state topology in steady state

222
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,300
they're all direct peers but what's

223
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:16,120
changing is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup topology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh the</font>

224
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,199
alternative paths we see as we change go

225
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,260
through the three different<font color="#E5E5E5"> providers</font>

226
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:25,240
and this one gets quite a bit more

227
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:27,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">complex we actually saw close to some 70</font>

228
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,610
or 80 different paths which fell into

229
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,949
the twenty-seven percent other quite a

230
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,440
bit of variety as the failover happens

231
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,810
and again this is just recording that

232
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,880
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty-six percent of the time we</font>

233
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,979
just see a primary backup path announced

234
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,990
and again by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way when we when we</font>

235
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,640
inject these withdraws its our prefix

236
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:48,670
there really is no other route<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

237
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,860
either these are the routes we're seeing

238
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:54,880
with a single home prefix being

239
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:56,260
withdrawn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> isp three so in the</font>

240
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,330
course of withdrawing their prefix

241
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">thirty-six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of the time we'd see</font>

242
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,500
the right back up path followed by the

243
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:06,730
withdrawal thirty-five percent we'd see

244
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:09,280
this rather than blue and so on so

245
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:11,380
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to talk over to ABBA and</font>

these three<font color="#CCCCCC"> different providers and all</font>

you

250
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:25,630
this is a laser pointer what did it

251
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:27,370
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,700
these different levels of complexity and

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three different examples that Craig</font>

266
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,460
this is basically your custard from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

or just send default to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer and</font>

287
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,000
relationship based on failure so

288
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,920
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> two peers have an agreement</font>

289
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,290
with each other that when one of their

290
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,170
up streams fails that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they will actually</font>

291
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:50,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn to the pier for default free route</font>

292
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,050
information so basically these

293
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,120
relationships constraint apology based

294
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,530
on the relationships between providers

295
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,900
whether or not their customer provider

296
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,490
or peer relationships<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

297
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,100
determine<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of possible backup</font>

298
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:05,100
paths so when we talk to the last nanog

299
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,150
and we said that there's n factorial

300
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,770
amount of states that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

301
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,900
explore in order for your system to

302
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:13,300
converge the constraint is actually

303
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,340
based on policy so depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how your</font>

304
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,020
policies are set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're either you're</font>

305
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:20,170
going to see some subset<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that n</font>

306
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:22,210
factorial so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show an</font>

307
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,670
example from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world basically so</font>

308
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,530
these are this<font color="#E5E5E5"> diagram shows a</font>

309
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,959
relationship between<font color="#E5E5E5"> five a esas that</font>

310
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,579
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in our data and so here you</font>

311
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,310
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that</font>

312
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:37,970
customer to is access you is actually a

313
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:40,910
customer of a s4 and s5 but has

314
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:43,660
appearing relationship with as3 so from

315
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:47,480
here you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the possible paths that</font>

316
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:50,689
node 3 is going to actually see so note

317
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:54,320
3 can possibly get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X with</font>

318
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:56,930
the path of 21 X with the path of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 42</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 X</font>

319
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,950
and in the case that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for actually fails</font>

320
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:03,530
over to its alternate path you might see

321
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:08,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">4521</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> x it's very interesting to note</font>

322
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:11,870
here that customer to is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ras to is</font>

323
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,420
actually a customer of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s4 and s5 but a</font>

324
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:21,010
s5 is actually a customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a s for</font>

325
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:24,650
itself in this diagram you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

326
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:28,069
s 2 is a customer of a s4 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

327
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:31,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">customer of a s5 but it's also buying a</font>

328
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:38,030
s5 is also a customer force you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

329
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:40,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this path is s2 is buying a service</font>

330
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,920
from a s5 na s4 even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

331
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:46,670
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer base for that</font>

332
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:49,069
clear one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you notice</font>

333
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,660
is that if you actually stick to a

334
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,700
hierarchical relationship between

335
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,839
providers you can eliminate some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

336
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,120
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths that you're going to</font>

337
00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:00,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">explore so from here I took out the</font>

338
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,820
relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> between as2 and as3 longer</font>

339
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:04,310
customers and kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to be a</font>

340
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,640
hierarchy so a s2 is buying service from

341
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,170
a s5 who then by service from a s4 so

342
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,750
you can pretend that s for might be a

343
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,670
tier<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 or something and so you note that</font>

344
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,200
the possible pads now are reduced we've

345
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,699
eliminate one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the possible states</font>

346
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> each one of these AS IS is going to</font>

347
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,800
explore and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so therefore you would think</font>

348
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,329
that based on the fact that you're

349
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,250
eliminating a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> states to</font>

350
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:28,070
explore that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your convergence time is</font>

351
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually going to be much faster so</font>

352
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,550
strictly hierarchical relationships

353
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,920
eliminate exploring some extra states

354
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:37,339
because policy controls the number of

355
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,660
possible paths you can explore but it

356
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,520
turns out that the number of paths

357
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,870
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't matter</font>

358
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,210
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a function</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the longest</font>

359
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:48,510
AAS pass in the system so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you notice</font>

360
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:50,940
from my past diagrams that the longest

361
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:52,620
path in this system which is following

362
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:55,980
hierarchical relationships it's actually

363
00:14:52,620 --> 00:15:04,140
three four or five to one which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

364
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:06,660
same in this so this diagram actually

365
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,580
shows that convergence is related to the

366
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,400
length of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lost longest possible back</font>

367
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,530
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> SAS path between two nodes so here</font>

368
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've plotted the longer the longest</font>

369
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:18,990
observed as path between an AS<font color="#CCCCCC"> pair and</font>

370
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:21,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the average Convergence time so you can</font>

371
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:24,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">see as the longest observed as path</font>

372
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:29,250
increases in length but the convergence

373
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:30,569
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually increases as well so what</font>

374
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,670
does all of this mean for convergence

375
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,110
time convergence timers are related to

376
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:36,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">the length of the longest a spaz it</font>

377
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:39,330
needs to be explored so before failover

378
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,939
occurs you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually need to withdraw all</font>

379
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,260
the alternative paths that you have this

380
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,570
means that the final would draw a

381
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:48,030
message for a given withdraw must

382
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,440
propagate across all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the AF is in the</font>

383
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,329
longest<font color="#E5E5E5"> phase path and that's where all</font>

384
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,640
of the delay comes from and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:55,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">see this applied to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Craig slides which</font>

386
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,270

387
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,460
backup has the longer it was going to

388
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,380
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> for converts and this longest path</font>

389
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:03,000
is released related to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy</font>

390
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,400
relationships that you have between

391
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,560
providers so providers with shorter<font color="#E5E5E5"> AAS</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">pass typically exert exhibit faster</font>

393
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,550
convergence so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we do about this</font>

394
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,380
well there's a couple of different

395
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:18,420
possible solutions to bgp this bgp

396
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,980
convergence problem one is an entirely

397
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,290
new protocol which is throw it all the

398

with everyone and have a full mesh but

406
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,970
we can all see the obvious problems with

<font color="#E5E5E5">that one another possibility that we've</font>

409
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:48,390
tagging vtp updates so you can provide a

410

00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:38,880
have an effect<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so when you say</font>

430
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,100
appearing with everyone is one way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

431
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,450
fixing it probably everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one off</font>

432
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:47,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">half</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> o block</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I thank you sorry um when</font>

433
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,470
if appearing with everyone having a one

434
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,020
hopper full mesh for everything solves

435
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:56,160
the problem question is is there a

436
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,900
threshold below which more peering is

437
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:03,360
making the problem worse that you're

438
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:04,890
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to observe versus any direct</font>

439
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,370
horizontal connections within the

440
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:09,390
hierarchy making things better well it's

441
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,979
the thing is is that it's actually

442
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,510
related to the longest possible paths

443
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,210
when you appear with everyone that path

444
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:17,700
is small but at the same time when you

445
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">also have when you're appearing with</font>

446
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,750
everyone you're going to you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,690
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly explore those dates will be</font>

448
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:27,510
insane<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me refine the question</font>

449
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:30,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is it related to the longest</font>

450
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:33,600
selected path out there or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> related</font>

451
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:36,240
to the longest possible path the longest

452
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,980
possible paths based on your policy so

453
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,370
if there is such a path like if your

454
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:44,340
normal path is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 a-s hops but you</font>

455
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,439
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> back-up path that 7a s hops</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">seven that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually constrains it even</font>

457
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,000
though you've currently selected the one

458
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:53,010
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> to before euro fell over to that</font>

459
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,650
the floor your mesh the longer the

460
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:59,030
potential backup paths are right but the

461
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:02,190
shorter the actual selected paths

462
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:04,139
yeah let me step back<font color="#CCCCCC"> again bo is it's</font>

463
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,620
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the longest path you have in</font>

465
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,500
it's also highly depend on other

466
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,320
people's policies it's really the

467
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,960
longest possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> a/s path possible for</font>

468
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,939
the system I didn't quite and I don't

469
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,310
think I could you understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> now yes we</font>

470
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:25,500
agree we didn't send your other question

471
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:28,230
but no you can you can ask it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

472
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:31,260
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're peering mesh right the</font>

473
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:34,470
more possible ways there are to get

474
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,660
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> two points right there are they</font>

475
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:38,970
are possible but they won't be selected

476
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,060
because you'll also have more shorter

477
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,620
paths all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that what we're</font>

478
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,580
saying I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that one of the</font>

479
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that were saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when we're</font>

480
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,720
suggesting you know hypothetically that

481
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,580
you could appear with everyone and that

482
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,990
would reduce the number that would

483
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,360
reduce the length of the longest AAS

484
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,040
pass we're actually meaning appear with

485
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,100
everyone so everything becomes one hop

486
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,139
away which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually different than</font>

487
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,850
you know to some levels related to

488
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,800
increasing your<font color="#CCCCCC"> pairing mesh but you're</font>

489
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,929
right if you do peer with a subset of

490
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,230
folks you actually increase that that

491
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:14,790
possibility or that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense I need</font>

492
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:18,000
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it you talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Alex by</font>

00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:21,389
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> EXO you talk to you talk about the</font>

495

factor and in the diagram you have that

496
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:29,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing you call the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vagabond path which</font>

497

we presume was unintentional I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

498
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:36,120
question is what percentage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the what</font>

499
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:38,070
percentage would one tend to reduce

conversions times by if these

501
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,360
unintentional parts which either appear

502
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,100
because of Miss implemented policy or

503
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:49,530
I've seen ones appear because the router

504
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:51,540
bugs what there were removed and you

505
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:53,610
only ended up with long past due to

506
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,350
people are you saying what percentage of

507
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:57,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">virgins improvement would you see if you</font>

508
00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:01,620
eliminated all the misconfigurations

509
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:03,570
yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah when we looked at the</font>

510
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,969
vagabond pass those were really

511
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,470
pathological outliers and we ended up

512
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,020
filtering those from a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other</font>

513
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,840
analysis

514
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,629
when a bag of my path occurs in general

515
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,949
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be bad in fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad</font>

516
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:18,790
translating<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be up to 30 different a</font>

517
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:20,380
esas before you come back but we managed

518
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,909
to filter those out by looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at past</font>

519
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,070
we saw at the beginning of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the study end</font>

520
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:26,590
of the study as well as normally many of

521
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:28,929
these paths<font color="#CCCCCC"> originate due to one or two</font>

522
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:31,419
isps filters being bad and which

523
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,700
suddenly allow a large number of these

524
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:36,400
paths to occur but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could</font>

525
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:40,960
contribute to some poorly configured

526
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:43,000
third parties router could contribute to

527
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,860
two other people suffering some form of

528
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,690
convergence delays perhaps several

529
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,639
minutes is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're saying yeah yes</font>

530
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,170
that when these pathological outliers

531
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,060
occur that can be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad and they</font>

532
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:54,220
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only affect the person who broke the</font>

533
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,990
filters they affect large sections of

534
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,870
the rest of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet good filters</font>

535
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:01,240
are important and be off to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

536
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:05,020
discussion and it leads right into the

537
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:08,650
next discussion yeah Randy reverse very

538
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:16,800
elemental want to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> him to pathology</font>

539
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:22,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">on very statement that the convergence</font>

540
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:27,340
problems are proportional to the longest

541
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:29,500
configured pads seems to conflict with

542
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:33,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">your statement that the solution for me</font>

543
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:36,040
is to peel with everybody because that

544
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:39,820
does not say that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not complex</font>

545
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:41,230
relationships behind everybody right the

546
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:47,919
theory is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means everyone is a</font>

547
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:49,900
customer I think we propose it in jest

548
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,420
because we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically implying that</font>

549
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,530
you would peer with everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

550
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,390
you would account for all those

551
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,879
comparisons every hospital<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

552
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,610

556
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,750
read your other paper will also be

557
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:13,250
helped if everybody were completely

558
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:15,300
global and meted all the same points

559
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:17,910
which i think is an interesting

560
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:24,300
challenge yeah we never said it was a

561
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:27,390
good solution third Ralph wait you're

562
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,040
saying the longest available<font color="#CCCCCC"> pass it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

563
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,500
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> effect on your convergence time when</font>

564
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,620
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a bad thing</font>

565
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:36,360
I can certainly see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how if you're single</font>

566
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,159
homes when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> withdraw your</font>

00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">advertisement that affects how long it</font>

568
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,210
takes for your withdrawal to get out

back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world if you're single</font>

00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,470
advertisement you don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> how long it</font>

572
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,250
takes because you're not getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

573
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:53,790
traffic anyway in a real case where you

574
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:55,770
have multiple paths if one of them goes

575
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,810
down and you withdraw that the actual

576
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:00,780
convergence time would depend on the

577
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:03,030
longest path<font color="#E5E5E5"> being withdrawn that was</font>

578
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:05,790
shorter than the next available<font color="#E5E5E5"> path</font>

579
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:08,639
what is it yes in fact we spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

580
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:10,889
time at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nog talk showing</font>

581
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,140
that when we did do experiments failing

582
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:16,140
over between two paths and it was a

583
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:19,410
sufficiently long prepended back up<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s</font>

584
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:22,020
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was exactly equivalent to withdrawing</font>

585
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:23,220
a single homepath but you are right

586
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">there you start to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into a middle</font>

587
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,030
ground you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to actually get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

588
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:29,880
length when you're doing failover to

589
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:32,430
getting past the threshold of longer

590
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,140
than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't say this anymore longer</font>

591
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:36,420
is it longer than the bat longer than

592
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:42,710
shortest yeah if you longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shortest</font>

593
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:42,710
primary path yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with you yeah</font>
