00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,910
good afternoon thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming out</font>

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:08,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a fine sunday afternoon to hear my</font>

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,950
presentation on<font color="#E5E5E5"> protection mechanisms</font>

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,809
and how you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply them to IP</font>

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,770
networks and how you can fly them to IP

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:19,410
technology but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get into that</font>

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:23,100
presentation I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make mention</font>

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:27,720
if you have not seen this posted around

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,909
discussion of protection mechanisms how

25
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,760
they apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some of technologies that</font>

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">you experience today when building</font>

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,110
networks as well as how they can apply

28
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">to IP technologies in the near future</font>

29
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:26,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">and therefore</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> allow for increased IP</font>

30
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:30,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">network survivability motivation behind</font>

31
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,400
this discussion comes primarily from the

32
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,100
new applications which are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> across</font>

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,900
the internet and those applications are

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:42,030
requiring that the requiring a very

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,409
stable network infrastructure the

36
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,040
mission-critical traffic they cannot

37
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,259
take time hits a good example is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,770
friend of mine works for a company<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

39
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,259
does derivatives trading and in their

40
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:58,199
environment a half second hit loses them

41
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:02,219
billions of dollars because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font>

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,110
they're playing the stock prices across

43
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:09,199
the different markets across the world

44
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:12,560
and so they have resisted moving to

45
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,839
things like ATM networks and even

46
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,379
public IP networks because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the fact</font>

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,730
that their business is so dependent on

48
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,760
the reliability<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the network</font>

49
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:27,230
infrastructure that's underlying their

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,470
their their communication systems

51
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:33,450
anytime you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> high priority and</font>

52
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,849
critical traffic you need to have a

53
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:41,159
network which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> capable of responding</font>

54
00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:43,980
very fast to these faults and protection

55
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:47,399
is one of the ways that exists today to

56
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,849
do that now protection schemes<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist at</font>

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,000
multiple layers in the communication

58
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:55,888
stack they aren't something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> apply</font>

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,209
specifically to sonnet which is the

60
00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:01,349
place that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably heard about them</font>

61
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:04,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">before protection is an automatic</font>

62
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,790
mechanism for recovering a traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> path</font>

63
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:08,340
key word there is traffic it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

64
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:13,409
transport that's being recovered but

65
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:16,979
traffic that's being recovered it's in

66
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:19,668
both we're working past sales the key

67
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:22,530
requirements are fast restoration time

68
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:25,470
protection mechanisms are typically

69
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,409
designed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal with 50 milliseconds or</font>

70
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,239
less hits on the actual traffic that's

71
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:33,239
being carried they need to be

72
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,340
predictable can't have issues due to

73
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,299
scaling that suddenly<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause these</font>

74
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,010
numbers to increase typically in order

75
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:43,139
to meet these requirements protection

76
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,739
paths of predetermined they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

77
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,510
something that are dynamically

78
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:51,209
determined on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly as network changes</font>

79
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,668
occur but rather at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that a</font>

80
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:56,159
service is set up the protection path is

81
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:57,889
established and then when there's a

82
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,439
failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the network it is utilized</font>

83
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:04,290
these protection paths can be dedicated

84
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,290
you can have a protection path allocated

85
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,659
at service<font color="#CCCCCC"> set-up time specifically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

86
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,489
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> service or can be used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a group</font>

87
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,798
of services that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may be protecting</font>

88
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,889
for example let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> say I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three cable</font>

89
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,659
routes across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. does it make</font>

90
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,478
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for me to have a service that's</font>

91
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:22,889
going across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> North route and a</font>

92
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,680
service that's going across the middle

93
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:28,789
route both individually protected at the

94
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,620
south route the answer is probably no

95
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:33,360
instead you probably can have just one

96
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,090
protection path<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on the south</font>

97
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,979
route which you can share by your<font color="#E5E5E5"> north</font>

98
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:44,700
and mid services but this does lead to

99
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:48,180
an issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how do you deal with double</font>

100
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:51,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">faults and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have to have some sort</font>

101
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">of preemption mechanism in place so that</font>

102
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,919
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> determine whether or not what's</font>

103

currently on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protection past should</font>

104
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:04,200
stay there or she'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be removed so</font>

105
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:05,940
protection can also be<font color="#CCCCCC"> pre-emptive now</font>

106
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,210
why would people want to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> protection</font>

107
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,760
as opposed to dynamic rerouting well

108
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:14,219
dynamic rerouting develops a<font color="#CCCCCC"> new path</font>

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,560
based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on current</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network state</font>

111
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,169
the network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the need for the</font>

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,029
failure information to be propagated for

113
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:27,029
all of the devices in the network to

114
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:29,550
then process that appropriately and then

115
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:32,039
services can be restored the delays

00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,270
associated with identifying a failure

[Music]

119
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,860
causes dynamically routing to take more

120

time than protection<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I know there is</font>

effect that comes from all of the state

information that's flooding through the

132
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,349
network let's say I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

133
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,900
has a number of nodes which are involved

00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:20,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a service path and then one of the</font>

136
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:28,229
fails well all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nodes within that</font>

137
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,820
area or within that larger<font color="#CCCCCC"> network will</font>

138
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:31,800
find out about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that link failure and</font>

139
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,149
will then go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> process for it</font>

140
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,230
and it could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they have no</font>

141
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:37,900
services that were really impacted by

I the link failure so the result is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some systems in your network</font>

piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of equipment is suffering from</font>

584
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:00,970
then you could actually end up with

585
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:02,500
failures again on that path so you don't

586
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:06,340
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have automatic</font>

reversion without a whole time another

588
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,970
good reason why you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have a whole</font>

589
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:12,149
time is let's say was brought back into

590
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:14,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">play because one of your technicians</font>

happens to move a fiber around<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

596
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,720
technicians thinking I'm trying to

597
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what the root cause of this</font>

598
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,200
issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know why the service is</font>

599
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:31,570
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and down or the transports</font>

600
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,400
going up and down but in reality you're

601
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,960
taking multiple hits on your services

602
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,110
that are being routed across that

603
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,880
particular piece of transport so having

604
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:42,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">a whole timer even if you are using</font>

605
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:46,390
active the verge or mag reversion is

606
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:49,418
definitely a good idea manual reversion

607
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:51,789
can be good to deal with some of these

608
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:54,490
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't have a whole timer</font>

609
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:56,890
capability within your equipment however

610
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:58,750
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> also end up with people saying</font>

611
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:02,289
well I'll take care of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Monday when</font>

612
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:04,059
I come into work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and guess what someone</font>

613
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,770
may have updated a database saying oh

614
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:07,780
yeah it got moved back onto the working

615
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:09,789
path but in reality it's still on the

616
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,020
protect path and all of a sudden during

617
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:12,250
the weekend there's another failure

618
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,960
which occurs somewhere else in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

619
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:17,860
network and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> protects app is</font>

620
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,630
available right<font color="#E5E5E5"> no and so you end up</font>

621
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:22,149
taking both services down the one that

622
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,770
you had reverted on restored on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday</font>

623
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:26,710
and the one which failed during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

624
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:28,450
weekend so manual reversion can be good

625
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:31,690
if you have a good lock step between

626
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:34,960
your inventory systems and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> equipment</font>

627
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,370
but if there's any possibility for those

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">two getting out of sync with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> each other</font>

629
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:43,139
you probably want to have some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

automatic withhold old timer you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing a service</font>

to move services over to those new

639
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,270

service that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll and then</font>

647
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,460
fail the service you want to roll in

648
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,469
wham-o it's now on the protect facility

649
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,690
and you've achieved that in very very

650
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:37,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">little time faster than any human can</font>

651
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:39,610
provision a piece of equipment so the

652
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:43,179
result<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you get a good service</font>

655
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:50,740
I just saw carrier come back up on this

other facility and we brought<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to it</font>

657
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,520
because most likely you've changed the

00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,290
configuration of it and the service

659
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,400
would end up you know that that had been

00:29:03,129 --> 00:29:10,789
now when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have multiple domains going</font>

on across your network it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is possible</font>

active at all the layers at the same

00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:51,589
time well there's one camp that says<font color="#CCCCCC"> gee</font>

protection is good because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it allows us</font>

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,559
furthermore you can end up with some

714
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,110
flashing issues let's say you have

00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:48,010
that's not hit list so<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATM will react</font>

727
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:50,030
that's not hit list so I p we will react

728
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:52,730
typically you do not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

729
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:55,879
multiple protection layers active at the

730
00:31:52,730 --> 00:32:01,010
same time however<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a good reason</font>

731
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:02,830
to do two layers most providers are

732
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:05,929
adopting a two-layer recovery model

733
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:09,199
where they use optical or sonnet

734
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:11,419
restoration basically as close to the

735
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,340
dirties you can get because it gives

736
00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:16,340
them the biggest bang for the buck in

737
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:18,290
terms of restoration let's imagine that

738
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a particular fiber that has on</font>

739
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:23,780
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty thousand services now those</font>

740
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:27,530
could be individual routes those could

741
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:30,168
be individual t1 do you want to have

742
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:32,690
your upper layer mechanisms trying to

743
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:34,820
reestablish each service individually we

<font color="#CCCCCC">do you want to have some underlying</font>

749
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:51,730
to you to do your first level of

750
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:53,720
restoration is typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good idea an</font>

751
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:57,440
optical is definitely the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

752
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:59,600
network's going but you do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

753
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,210
some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of service level restoration</font>

754
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,070
to to put it all at the optical layer

755
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:06,230
means that you expect the optical

756
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:09,049
devices to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine bit</font>

things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could signify a particular</font>

760
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:20,780
optical layer is only capable of saying

761
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:23,059
light on our level<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks good so you</font>

762
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,399
can't rely solely on the optical layers

763
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:26,960
to do your protection switching you have

764
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,620
to have something which is intelligent

765
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,350
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sir</font>

00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,960
run into here is what happens if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

both divide both players to do the

777
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,110
protection switch and you'll possibly

778
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:08,840
end up with the same thrashing scenario

779
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:10,730
that i mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier typically what</font>

780
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,889
will happen what a service provider will

781
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:15,409
do is they'll set their upper layer

782
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:18,350

[Music]

794
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:48,300
gee I think I've gone through all these

795
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:53,580
board points basically is talking about

796
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:56,310
why you want two layers any other issues

797
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,220
I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about here so</font>

798
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:00,759
[Music]

799
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:02,259
okay now we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about protection</font>

800
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,300
and sonnet now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the environment</font>

801
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">you probably are most familiar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with when</font>

802
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:11,170
it comes to protection services being

803
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:15,910
available to you sonnet offers linear

which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> two fiber and the other which</font>

two have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with we're going to</font>

810
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,310
first attempt to do restoration around

811
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,869
your ring and for fiber you're capable

812
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:37,869
of doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's called a spam switch</font>

813
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:40,630
think of it just like linear<font color="#CCCCCC"> ApS between</font>

814
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:43,690
two neighboring nodes so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

815
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:46,330
ring and this note in this node suffer a

816
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:48,940
fiber cut which only affects two of the

817
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:50,980
four fibers going between them I can

818
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:53,710
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> move the transmit receive paths</font>

819
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,330
to those other two fibers restore the

00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:58,570

821
00:35:55,330 --> 00:36:00,369
bandwidth around the ring however how

822
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:03,190
often<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you end up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a fiber bundle</font>

823
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:05,230
only getting partially cut what happens

00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:07,210
with for fiber be less are the different

than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 25 herbalists are is when the</font>

overhead in the k0 and k1 bites now as I

856
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:43,450
mentioned sonnet has a number of service

857
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:45,970
level items which can actually cause a

866
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:06,730
could be a threshold crossing trash

00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:14,160
instance more than 100 video events

1176

no amplification of the signal so you

difference in a DWDM environment all

1241

you're doing is taking multiple services

DWDM system where you actually get into

1245
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:40,740
switching would be an optical switch

1246

we're in a sonnet switch which you put

1247
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:45,509
at the end of your DWDM system so DWDM

doesn't have any switching capability

with Cisco's aps and the answer is nope

1301
00:58:21,819 --> 00:58:30,420
sorry haven't haven't actually implement

1302
00:58:25,299 --> 00:58:35,530
i worked with there's other questions

1303
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:38,140
yes come early in your presentation

1304
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:40,930
about the need for coordination between

1305
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:45,759
protection of the ring yeah could you

1306
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:48,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell us it will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rock yes I do have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1307
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,500
flip chart to have any markers yes I do

1308
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:53,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay excuse me I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk away from</font>

1309
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:56,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mic for this one or maybe I might be</font>

1310
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:56,279
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> move it over here for you</font>

1311
00:58:56,650 --> 00:59:08,900
[Music]

1312
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:10,250
can you all see the flip chart I'm sorry

1313
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:14,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">for those of you that can see can you</font>

1314
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:17,060
see the flip chart the question is

1315
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:18,169
really are in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation they made</font>

1316
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:20,240
a comment about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> need for</font>

1317
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:24,350
coordination between protection domains

1318
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:25,609
and could<font color="#E5E5E5"> I elaborate on that and I'm</font>

1319
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:27,200
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to draw some things on the board</font>

1320
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:29,869
here I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and stay close to the mic</font>

1321
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:31,790
as I'm commenting you could have a

1322
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:34,920
network with multiple protection domains

1323
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:47,609
existing between source and destination

1324
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:50,079
[Music]

1325
00:59:47,609 --> 00:59:51,308
so I've drawn a simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> network up here</font>

1326
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:53,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to divide it into</font>

1327
00:59:51,309 --> 01:00:01,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">three protection domains</font>

1328
00:59:53,140 --> 01:00:04,049
[Music]

1329
01:00:01,339 --> 01:00:05,969
what you see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two ring networks</font>

1330
01:00:04,049 --> 01:00:07,380
on either side and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then in the middle</font>

1331
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:09,420
you see what I'll call<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mesh network</font>

1332
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:11,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's a very simple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mesh network with</font>

1333
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:12,779
only two nodes in it but it's a mesh

1334
01:00:11,369 --> 01:00:14,400
network because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fact that it's</font>

1335
01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:15,900
got other protection domains to the

1336
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,289
sides of it as opposed to direct user

1337
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:21,089
interfaces the issue you run into have

1338
01:00:19,289 --> 01:00:23,999
to deal with how does a service map on

1339
01:00:21,089 --> 01:00:26,578
to these protection domains you could

1340
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:29,640
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example if you're using global</font>

1341
01:00:26,579 --> 01:00:31,109
repair a mecca path that goes from

1342
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,019
source to destination which traverses

1343
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:35,430
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> north or northern elements at</font>

1344
01:00:34,019 --> 01:00:39,988
another path which traverses the

1345
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:40,500

[Music]

1348
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:54,700
sorry there was a backhoe in that last

1349
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:58,600
link so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see here now the two paths</font>

1350
01:00:54,700 --> 01:01:00,700
between the left and right side now the

1351
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:02,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem that you run into is neither</font>

1352
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,910
none<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these protection domains are</font>

1353
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,129
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the end-to-end</font>

1354
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:08,410
protection or for protection within

1355
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:09,640
their domain they have to harmonize with

1356
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:11,160
each other on how the end-to-end

1357
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:16,330
protection is going to be done

1358
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:18,310
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look here I got to</font>

1359
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:20,529
egress is to this protection domain for

1360
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:23,440
one service entrance so for one service

1361
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:26,920
that's being carried likewise over here

1362
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:31,390
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have two services coming in for one</font>

1363
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:49,030
service going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how do I let the</font>

1364
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:53,500
traffic go become the question had to

1365
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:58,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal with the coordination that may be</font>

1366
01:01:53,500 --> 01:02:00,640
necessary between the IP layer engineers

1367
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:04,050
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the comments</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were optical layer</font>

1368
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:06,609
engineers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that requirements</font>

1369
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:08,350
should be provided by the IP engineers

1370
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:10,870
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> optical or sonnet layer engineers</font>

1371
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:12,730
in order to have them configure there

1372
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:15,819
are protection mechanisms appropriately

1373
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:17,680
so that then IP can properly react and

1374
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:19,420
this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to do more with</font>

1375
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,710
organizational structure the fact that

1376
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:22,150
you have two different<font color="#CCCCCC"> groups dealing</font>

1377
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:23,980
with the two different technologies and

1378
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:26,020
then you have an interface point between

1379
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:27,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the groups yeah you certainly can end up</font>

1380
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:29,320
with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue where one group thinks</font>

1381
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:31,030
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know sonnet is the be-all and</font>

1382
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,740
end-all of where you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

1383
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:34,300
protection and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do 50</font>

1384
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:36,879
millisecond protection regardless of

1385
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:38,710
whatever you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the upper layer you</font>

1386
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,210
know plus they may also do optical

1387
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:42,010
protection you know they see sonnet as

1388
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:44,530
their service layer they see optical as

1389
01:02:42,010 --> 01:02:46,390
their dirt layer and now you start

1390
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:48,550
getting into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the multiple stacks of</font>

1391
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:51,220
where the stacking of multiple

1392
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:52,750
protection layers you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it</font>

1393
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:54,220
from a more holistic perspective you

1394
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:57,490
need to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the service is actually</font>

1395
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:59,859
being sold with customers IP and then

1396
01:02:57,490 --> 01:03:01,779
your underlying service providers react

1397
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:03,369
appropriately now how do you deal with

1398
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:04,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an environment where you may</font>

1399
01:03:03,369 --> 01:03:06,420
have one service provided buying

1400
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:08,140
services from another service provider

1401
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:11,020
unfortunately you do end up with

1402
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:12,790
inefficiencies there unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

1403
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:16,570
very good partnership relationship with

1404
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:18,310
your underlying carrier you could be

1405
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:20,020
relegated to what they have is public

1406

1407
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:24,160
protection mechanisms and use your

1408
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:27,819
asking usually for an individual case

1409
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:32,470
base price product yes you've touched on

1410
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:35,619
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue just then the that I think</font>

01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:37,140
several several colleagues 900 for

1412

having a problem and that is

1413
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:46,660
understanding when one buys obstacle

1414
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:49,390

with trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find that out has been</font>

01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:18,759
alone<font color="#CCCCCC"> contemp in that particular mystery</font>

1424
01:04:15,609 --> 01:04:20,529
yes yeah look the comment had to deal

1425
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:22,270
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that in an environment</font>

1426
01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:23,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">where you have service providers buying</font>

1427
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:26,980
services from other service providers

1428
01:04:23,859 --> 01:04:29,109
that sometimes there's this cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1429
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:31,410
secrecy around how the underlying

1430
01:04:29,109 --> 01:04:33,790
carrier has built their network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

1431
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:35,618
you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with two issues one is what</font>

1432
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:37,450
exactly are they implementing with and

1433
01:04:35,619 --> 01:04:39,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other is how do you tell them that</font>

1434
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:41,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want something different and it</font>

1435
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:43,869
really comes down to what is the

1436
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:45,960
business relationship unfortunately the

1437
01:04:43,869 --> 01:04:50,350
business relationship seems to be

1438
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:51,550
independent of of the labia more tender

1439
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:52,500
than I thought but it seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1440
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:53,250
independent

our of our company behind us and

1464

that you specified in your contract that

like what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual fiber routes</font>

1499
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:14,950
look like so forth you're not going to

they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually changed carriers because</font>

1504
01:07:24,350 --> 01:07:29,960
of the fact that one of the weather or

1505
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:32,750
older carrier had said yes everything in

1506
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:35,450
the network is diverse well since they

1507
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:38,840
do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of international work they have</font>

01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:41,060
connections going from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. to the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to get to the Far East they could go</font>

01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:49,190
through Europe for the diverse path from

1514

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary path it turned out that the</font>

first pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> was going through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact</font>

1516
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:58,070
same international pop in California so

1517
01:07:54,680 --> 01:08:00,620
they had no diversity 11 miss anchored

1518
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:05,570
tanker took their service outer part of

1519
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:07,759
the Far East so yeah it's the way that

1520
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:09,500
you can do know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can start to</font>

1521
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,330
validate whether or not the services

that you purchased our divorce is

1523
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:17,210
through basically a session where you

1524
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:19,880
sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down with your carrier and say</font>

1525
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:21,270
produce all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the design layout records</font>

1526
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,750
or dlrs for

01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:26,450
were the services that i purchased and

1528
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:28,470
show me that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really are diverse</font>

typically someone who just approaches

1532

you know an IHC and says<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to buy</font>

01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:44,279
visibility that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you</font>

1535
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:45,930
typically have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> negotiate to get but</font>

1536
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:49,170
once you have the dlr information you

1537
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:53,310
can do an audit but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is that</font>

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current way that that I exceeds</font>

diversity routing typically what they

1541
01:09:05,189 --> 01:09:08,219
have is basically just a Bink database

1542
01:09:06,689 --> 01:09:09,689
which shows all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the circuits all the</font>

01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:11,250
design layout records and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

1544
01:09:09,689 --> 01:09:14,068
requires a human being to determine

whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not some activity they're</font>

1546
01:09:14,069 --> 01:09:17,430
doing in the network is going to cause

diversity that's been ordered to be

1548
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:24,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">removed so the result anytime they do</font>

1549
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:26,220
some sort of a regrouping exercise or

1550
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:30,720
rolling exercise you can easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up</font>

1551
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:32,630
with with diversity lost I know we're

looking forward to being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide</font>

1553
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:39,560
automated schemes to do not diverse

every layer of network that exists

01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:56,660
between the service that's being sold

and dirt now<font color="#E5E5E5"> even duct becomes important</font>

1598
01:11:56,660 --> 01:12:03,620
I know somebody i worked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

1599
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:06,110
sidewalk that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a major</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> customer that</font>

1600
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:08,780
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i want to make certain that</font>

1601
01:12:06,110 --> 01:12:12,259
the services you've sold us our diverse

1602
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:15,559
and so what they did is they hopped in a

1603
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:20,690
truck and they drove the routes well

1604
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:22,370
this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular customer along the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">route said wait a second we've been</font>

1606
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:27,410
through this intersection before so they

1607
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:29,270
had diversity<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the fiber perspective</font>

1608
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:31,550
but in reality you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there was a</font>

1609
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:35,150
point that existed with both routes

1610
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:36,470
crossed each other okay so that's where

1611
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:39,670
you start getting into<font color="#E5E5E5"> duck diversity</font>

1612
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:42,410
issues you have to do it a deputy layer

1613
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:44,970
and unfortunately idealize don't really

1614
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:46,440
show duck layer diversity issues

01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:52,860
no I don't know dlr is typically written

1617
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:56,130
based on inventory tags that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist them</font>

1618
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:58,320
in a database and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual physical</font>

1619
01:12:56,130 --> 01:13:01,860
route isn't something that's really you

01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:03,449
know talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> its you know you got</font>

this particular span of fiber going

1626
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:23,989

[Music]

1628
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:36,530
right right the comment was that not

1629
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:38,330
everything is tracked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inventory</font>

1631
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:46,400
what's in inventory you you cannot rely

1632
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:50,150
solely on<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealer audit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to you</font>

particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> network which we were</font>

1635
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:56,840
building out we had a place like that

1636
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:59,720
and fortunately we never had fiber cuts

1637
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:01,430
in that place but we knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font>

1638
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:04,960
an exposure that existed because of our

1639
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:04,960
underlying carrier's network was built

1640

[Music]

1641
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:09,080
that's an important thing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

1642
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,210
when you're actually building out your

1643
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:14,990
own fiber networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> now where's a good</font>

1644
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:18,350
place to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put a pop or a place where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1645
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:20,300
do traffic exchange it probably would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1646
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:22,390
good for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have those demarcations</font>

1647
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:24,650
occur where you're doing fiber crossings

1648
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:27,900
because of the fact that you can usually

1649
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:31,509
switch around then

1650

anybody used up all my time yet how much

1653

time do I have left 15 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay 15</font>

01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:54,880

implement mpls there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a lot</font>

of companies working on them I I would

submit we're not talking you know five
