1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,279
five more<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes and and what we want</font>

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is we want to extend this approach</font>

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:13,950
of actively testing protocols in the

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,839
internet from time not only actively

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,849
testing what TC fees are out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,640
how what kind of congestion control web

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,430
servers are using for their TTP's but

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,470
also things like what kind of queue

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,930
management is running in the congested

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,488
length of a path in a router and it's a

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,739
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> harder to come from the outside</font>

12
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,980
determine who's what router is using

13
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,089
what kind of activity management but we

14
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:43,140
one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,300
and and as a first step I thought I

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,860
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people what</font>

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,949
and so I'm interested one of the things

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,739
I'm interested in is what what routers

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,300
out there run active to management such

20
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:58,129
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> red and I'm will explain what that is</font>

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,510
and what routers out there don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

22
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:01,919
then I'll say a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about how</font>

23
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,570
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> test that we're planning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,369
check for things like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm Sally</font>

25
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">Floyd and I'm also at a theory which is</font>

26
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:16,020
rigid to experiment Verna's from so

27

sorry red which is random early

28

29
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,889

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,449

bursts of packets when only one packet

<font color="#E5E5E5">notes the other reason that why we're</font>

64
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,750
interested in in active queue management

65
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,000
is it it's a precondition for using

66
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,920
explicit congestion notification<font color="#E5E5E5"> ecn</font>

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,610
which is something that's now an

68
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,859
experimental part of the IP architecture

69
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,600
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ecn is when the router instead of</font>

70
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,700
dropping a packet to tell the end notes

71
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,010
to slow down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just set the ecn bit in</font>

72
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,170
the packet header if the packet says

73
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:01,320
it's capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of understanding ecn and</font>

74
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,518
you can't run ecn unless you already are

75
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,350
doing some kind of active queue

76
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,940
management unless you're detecting

77
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,480
congestion before the buffer actually

78
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,480
overflows

79
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,370
so so a lot of routers out there have

80
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">act a few management I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean there's</font>

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">weighted red and all of the cisco</font>

82
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,439
routers a different other routers have

83
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,299
different forms of active to management

84
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:28,049
my understanding is that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> mostly not</font>

85
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:29,340
turned on in ISPs and my<font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding</font>

86
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:33,420
is it's mostly not turned on because

87
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,859
most ISPs say they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have congestion</font>

88
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,589
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> core of their networks a and</font>

89
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:38,609
therefore they don't need it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

kind of collecting feedback from people

not here in real time but afterwards of

96
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:53,370
people send<font color="#CCCCCC"> me email about what is PS</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> test that we're thinking of doing to</font>

124
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:04,400
check whether the congested router along

00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:08,210
your path is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> using active to</font>

126
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,188
management would be tests of seeing if

127
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,568
there's persistent queuing delay so if

128
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:13,639
there's persistent queuing delay it's

129
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:15,650
not from a routing change that's an

130
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,539
indication<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the congested router</font>

along your path isn't using active to

00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:23,270
management another indication would be

133
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:25,189
that there's for a flow that's sending a

congestion control and sending a

going to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot harder than the test</font>

147
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:03,229
for how TCP and web servers is

148
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:06,349
functioning and that's my email address

149
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:08,419
for you to see reorg there's a mailing

150
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:12,349
list about we had implementation issues

151
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:15,490
there's a red web page and there's some

152
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:18,610
references for some things in the top

153
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,610
thank you

154
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:35,480
I I have a question you may have said

tests did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font>

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:49,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">that okay you want to talk a little more</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">be like the tests that we're running on</font>

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,260
web<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers and that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tests we're</font>

165

running to see what kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tcp or you</font>

166
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,570
have at your have a TCP is functioning

167
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:13,320
at a web server is to ask to ask for

168
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:17,010
some data from that web server to at the

169
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,480
receiver drop a few packets report that

170
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,940
those packets were dropped and see how

171
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,100
the web server responds so it's just

172
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,080
it's indistinguishable from how

173
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,210
legitimate traffic would behave if it

174
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,849
had these exact packets<font color="#CCCCCC"> dropped it we</font>

175
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:33,479
want to drop its no greater load on the

176
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:35,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">web server than that and that and it</font>

177
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:37,140
shows how the web server would respond

178
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,820
in a real in the real case that would

179
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,430
really happen if those exact packets

180
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,719
were dropped it just would be tedious<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

181
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,280
passively monitor and find a trace in

182
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,570
which those exact packets were dropped

183
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,159
it's easier just to drop those<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

184
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,880
packets and see what the web server does

185
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:53,220
so the so that so so so tests of active

186
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,560
queue management would be exactly the

187
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,540
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be running a TCP</font>
