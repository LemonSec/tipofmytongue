the draft in a in a nutshell basically

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:21,900
consists of really three<font color="#CCCCCC"> things one is a</font>

51
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:26,030
new capability<font color="#E5E5E5"> that allows a router to</font>

say hi I support Chris will restart and

it's got some flags one<font color="#E5E5E5"> says whether i'm</font>

restart right now and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other whether</font>

56
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:38,670
I've preserved my fit or not because

57
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,120
there's certainly the potential for a

58
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:44,819
router that has not preserved its<font color="#E5E5E5"> bid or</font>

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,560
cannot preserve its fit for example if

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire chassis restarted you</font>

couldn't preserve your your<font color="#E5E5E5"> bid and the</font>

62
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,510
the other major thing that's carried by

63
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,040
the capability is a timer and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

64
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,670
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the timer in a second but the idea</font>

65
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:03,269
is for the timer to say wait wait this

66
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:06,629
long before<font color="#E5E5E5"> tearing me down if you if</font>

00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:08,819
you see me restart and the other new

68
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:11,220
messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduced is actually kind of</font>

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,440
a.m. you could say a perversion or a

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,599
clever use of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> existing message and</font>

71
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,919
it's a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say this is the end of end</font>

when a BGP session is established so

75
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,349
it's a way for my peers to tell me I've

76
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,180
sent you all my initial routes and it's

77

a way for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell my peers okay I've</font>

like I said BGP stops the neighbors

81
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,739
don't have to tear down the TCP session

82

right away they wait for the timer that

I introduced<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the previous slide to</font>

timer appears instead of flushing the

they'll keep them in their in their<font color="#E5E5E5"> rib</font>

they'll keep using them they'll keep

00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,170
Confederations are actually the same

315
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,290
of shooting yourself in the foot by

316
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,270
building routing loops in neither case

317
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,030
has there been any fundamental change to

00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:03,699
the protocol one further point about

319
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:07,810
Confederations is that there was there

320
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:11,680
were a couple of just simple mistakes in

321

the in the RFC one was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the code</font>

324
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,220

325
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:25,810
reverse them in the RFC to make them

326
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:27,340
reflect reality also the RFC said

327
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,589
something about building nested

the deployment sections are really

332
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,740
fairly similar and I'm going to talk

about them as one thing I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

all this equipment guidelines basically

00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">our are driving at one simple problem</font>

337
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:54,090
which is that both route reflectors and

clusters or<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Confederations</font>

339

over<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

you try hard enough but the the

guidelines that are introduced in both

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,910

we'll have a celebration of that also so

okay I avoid overlapping clusters not

360
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,459
going to spend long in this because I

the colors on the fly anyway the in the

having you know they have for whatever

the prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it learned from outside</font>

prefixes to their clients just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

381
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,040
they're supposed to you and you end up

382
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:02,069
with the forwarding topology shown in

383
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:06,510

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> build your clusters or sub a SS so</font>

386
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:17,990
that so they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> overlap the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

shown here this will never happen

388
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:25,079
okay so second point why do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

389
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:28,530
set a GP metrics to prefer intra cluster

example where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't done that you</font>

392
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:38,310
can see that route reflector tues<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths</font>

to reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> both a and B on the the numbers</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">they're on the edges represent metrics</font>

395
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:46,650
right reflector tues path is going to be

396
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:50,850
six<font color="#E5E5E5"> or five to reach a or b whereas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

can to reach see<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what's the</font>

398
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:59,429
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay suppose a advertises some</font>

399
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,920
prefix router<font color="#CCCCCC"> collector one now has in</font>

400
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,900
its routing table this prefix and it's

got an igp distance of five to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there</font>

and that's all that's in there so far in

403
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:13,950
the example so it's selected<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now be</font>

00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:16,080
also advert has the same prefix the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

405
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:18,150
metric is a little bit better there's an

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,520

because the ASR different<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so route</font>

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,510
reflector one changes to select that

411
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:35,610
route because it's common it's got a

412
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:37,320
better idea metric<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now router see</font>

413
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,770
also announces the same prefix to its

414
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,450
route reflector it's got an igp of 10

415
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,420
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> so far that's the only thing in</font>

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,740
route reflector to use table it selected

417

all right now we're at<font color="#E5E5E5"> reflector</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 and</font>

418

<font color="#CCCCCC">exchange their routes in some order no</font>

420
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,800
its timing dependent but this example

421
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,909
works no matter what the timing is

422
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,270
supposed route reflector to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> sends</font>

00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:30,240
comparing a and C and you pick a because

435
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:32,520
it's got a better I GP metric<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

436
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,740
so now we send an update to route

437
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,340
reflector to you that says oh here's my

438
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,840
my selected route it's a and from

439
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:44,580
reflector to use perspective it's got an

440
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:46,080
igp metric<font color="#E5E5E5"> of six well on route</font>

443
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:57,240
so the selected route changes next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step</font>

444
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:01,710
it with Rossi because it's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer the</font>

447
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,800
