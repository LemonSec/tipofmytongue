<font color="#CCCCCC">Steve Smith from the FBI who is the lead</font>

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,730
engineer and again a group of<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineers</font>

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,290
there I believe anyway he<font color="#CCCCCC"> is here to</font>

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:18,480
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about distributed denial of service</font>

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:20,369
and thanks for<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming Steve thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,869
I'm actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue to wear</font>

7
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,310
my coat today but<font color="#CCCCCC"> just because it</font>

8
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,900
presents the proper image but more

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,019
realistically because it's freezing up

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,490
here I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about both</font>

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,619
distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> denial-of-service attacks</font>

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,410
and also just generic denial of service

13
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,360
attacks sit a couple parameters around

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,129
what I'm going to say today this is not

15
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,890
a technical discussion this is more of a

16
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,968
policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and procedural discussion one</font>

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,770
where I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for input</font>

18
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:46,260
from you so the most important thing

19
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,520
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my point of view is that if you</font>

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:53,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">have something to say about this topic</font>

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:55,050
please do what have<font color="#E5E5E5"> we seen recently we</font>

22
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,670
being the federal government not

23
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,050
necessarily we being everybody in this

24
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,210
room this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something I'd like</font>

25
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,120
corrections on changes to additions etc

26
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,589
if you have something to<font color="#CCCCCC"> add a whole lot</font>

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,960
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff whoops we need to get on the</font>

28

screen here which one is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font>

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay there we go a lot of increases in</font>

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,290
activity recently recently being the

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,360
last 60 to 90 days it was the previous

32
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,759
occurrence that we've seen maybe one or

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:29,460
two multi-hundred node network of<font color="#E5E5E5"> do us</font>

35
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,559
given time now we're seeing many more

36
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,990
than one why is this happening well

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,420
increases in ease of use is my guess of

38
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,530
a lot of the the tools so we can enable

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,340
a lot more script kiddies to get

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:07,679
that this time actually we're seeing

50
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:10,020
networks where we've got everything from

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">Windows machines through</font>

52

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,370
bothers me<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit because it means</font>

people are reaching<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit further</font>

57
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,310
this is the interactive part of the

58
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,890
conversation and I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> help from you</font>

59
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,910
guys here is what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this we</font>

60
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,500
being a federal government<font color="#E5E5E5"> the United</font>

61
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,120
was set up by the President to

62
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,100
coordinate the federal government's

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,700
response to certain types of activities

64
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:41,549
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we do is respond</font>

65
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,500
to certain types of attacks on computer

66
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,360
networks now what does respond meaning

67
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,950
the federal government parlance it means

68
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we collect information we</font>

69
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,070
distribute information yes I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

70
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,790

71
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:56,040
part but we also try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get stuff out</font>

72
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,920
to people who are the victims of these

73
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,840
attacks one note on the bottom yes I

74
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we need to release source on the</font>

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:09,600
fine DDoS tool that is a favourite topic

76
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:12,810
in the government at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment this is</font>

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,930
we're facing right now open amplifier

79
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,790
sites by what what I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the open</font>

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">amplifier site issue is those who</font>

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that go out and look for directive</font>

83
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,920
broadcast amplifiers whether they be

84
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,690
technically correct or not is that

85
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that's worth approaching I've</font>

86
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,520
talked to a few of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you in an email about</font>

87
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,450
what's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best way to deal with that</font>

88
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,709
type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> activity is it worth people</font>

89
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,310
approaching it trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get these</font>

90
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,770
amplifiers shut down typically you know

91
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,070
folks will send email to the the owner

92
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:52,050
the registrant of particular either

93
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,640
logical domains or IP space etc saying

94
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,140
hey you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an open amplifier site</font>

95
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,049
shut it down we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all know how effective</font>

96
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,640
that is in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of situations there is</font>

97
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,770
the possibility if people think it's

98
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,739
worthwhile that I could end up having an

99
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,000
FBI agent go knock on doors of

100
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,230
registered owners a particular IP space

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,310
now whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to be the</font>

102
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,829
actual user is a different story

103
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,120
entirely but at least it would start<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

104
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,370
process of bringing to people's

105

attention the fact that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are</font>

106
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,899
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem if you folks believe that they</font>

107
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem to warrant</font>

108
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,448
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of activity or if</font>

109
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:25,909
fool would be received so negatively

110
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:27,830
that it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually hurt the efforts</font>

111
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,760
to shut these down I need to hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

112
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:32,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of feedback amplifiers that are</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">already used in crime this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

114
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,979
situation where for instance if we have

00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:39,470
an attack that's happened on name your

116

large site or individual users at

117
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:45,169
universities etc we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already know where</font>

118
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:47,449
the network is of affected machines

00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:51,020
through investigative opportunities

red we approach them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in person will go</font>

122
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,330
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the registered owners and try and</font>

123
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,760
trace back from there saying hey who's

124
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,219
actually got these IPS and here's what

125
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,590
we've seen this is what has happened you

126
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,930
may want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take corrective action</font>

127
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,210
should we notify<font color="#CCCCCC"> VN upstream provider</font>

128
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,560
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> that be a more timely notification</font>

129
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,799
it takes me several days in a lot of

<font color="#E5E5E5">situations to get somebody out the door</font>

that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of notification is that</font>

00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,650
something that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a service to</font>

your customers would<font color="#CCCCCC"> it be a service to</font>

occasionally find out about these things

before they're used typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll find</font>

out about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them when they're in stage of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it grow as we watch it grow we then have</font>

that I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get information out is to a</font>

affects the way the net functions but

202
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,670
this is the liability for you personally

number one because<font color="#E5E5E5"> your information may</font>

206
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,330
is there's always the potential that

207
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,430
someone will launch into civil liability

208

as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result of the use of that network</font>

209
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,940
that's a messy messy issue I only want

210
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,930
to get really mirror if I can avoid it

211
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:16,760
but us notifying people usually us being

you know the nasty guys in the dark

213
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:22,730
suits usually has a positive effect on

00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,170
management personnel and it doesn't

<font color="#CCCCCC">always but it usually has a positive</font>

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,190
there's a bad thing going on same way we

00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:36,079
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if there was a you know a bad guy</font>

00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:46,100
that kind of activity because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

225
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:53,000
else has comments I do oh good I think

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">you I'm not sure where the last</font>

227
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,560
questioner just went but I think you

228
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">might have misunderstood the question I</font>

229
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:03,050
think he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a public</font>

230
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,790
place like<font color="#CCCCCC"> math where the to list these</font>

231
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,979
sites perhaps make it impossible for

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:09,050
people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use them is that what you're</font>

233
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,790
thinking Paul yeah I understand the

234
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,400
background of maps in an ordinate cetera

235
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:16,310
and wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> step away from that</font>

236
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I can't for various policy</font>

237
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,869
reasons get near embarrassing people in

238
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:24,410
public<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I was also saying well if I</font>

239
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,810
was sitting out there I would definitely

240
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,949
be embarrassed if my name popped up but

241
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,650
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately</font>

242
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,720
who aren't and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get to them</font>

243
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,860
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that interested me</font>

244
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,230
because how do we get to the people who

245
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't care or you don't notice that</font>

246
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,440
they're up on those kinds of sites I

247
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,260
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the federal government can't</font>

248
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,880
do that I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put up a mirror of of</font>

249
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,680
maps and say hey look at all these

250
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,660
goofballs we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't run their networks</font>

251
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,140
well so I have to take a different

252
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:56,689
approach hi I'm fall<font color="#CCCCCC"> vixy and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I started</font>

253
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:59,150
maps and we looked into doing a smurf

254
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,940
amplifier list some years ago the

255
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:04,280
problem being that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology we use</font>

256
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:08,000
right now Saul destination address based

257
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:12,650
and some buddies over at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco of and</font>

258
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,650
talking to me about a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to to apply</font>

259
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:17,120
bgp filters to source address which

260
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,770
would be very useful for this kind of

261
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,170
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can bet that as soon as</font>

262
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:23,300
that happens maps will sort of step

263
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,699
outside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mail abuse field and make a</font>

264
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,560
an active list of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Smurf amplifiers for</font>

265
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:33,140
exactly this kind of purpose but to

266
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,760
answer a question you asked earlier in

267
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,930
your presentation as far as knocking on

268
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:40,910
the doors I've heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your</font>

269
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,229
jackbooted thugs and I would love it if

270
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,760
instead of knocking on the door you

271
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,920
would kick the door in and tell people

272
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font>

273
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">use close</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there they're smart amplifiers</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I forgot my boots I'm sorry well</font>

275
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:05,079
wingtips do for now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay depends that</font>

276
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:09,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're steel toed I'm bill</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Manning and</font>

277
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:12,010
I had the dubious distinction of having

278
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:15,040
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my machines actually land in rbl</font>

279
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,689
for the first time and I was incensed

280
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,949
for about 30 seconds when I thought this

281
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:23,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really cool because I now blocked</font>

282
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:25,029
whatever the number is forty to sixty to

283
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:27,010
ninety eight percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet</font>

284
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:29,860
from getting to my machine for further

285
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:31,870

286
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,089
industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the community is willing</font>

287
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:37,120
to shun me for a while so i can go play

288
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:41,740
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my sandbox</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so if I leave that</font>

289
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:44,709
relay open then I effectively air-gap

290
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,420
myself so in some sense you could sort

291
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:49,229
of turn this around and say this is a

292
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:53,589
good way to get some well-deserved

293
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:58,110

implementation become part of our BL

295
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,079
okay we've got one on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the go</font>

296
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,000
visit them side there's got to be

297
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:08,829
somewhere somebody in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this audience who</font>

298
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,529
believes that anything that we do is is

299
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:13,120
not a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and I respect that</font>

300
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:15,699
believe it or not because we need that

301
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of balance in society and I'd like</font>

302
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:19,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hear from the other side please if</font>

303
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,350
people don't believe that's a good idea

304
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:21,910
and I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other reasons why</font>

305
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:26,769
because then we can tell management too

306
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:30,310
bad choice speaking not formal anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

307
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:33,490
think well what what we often hear think

308
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:38,099
and say is that the FBI response is so

309
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:40,990
slow is to be not helpful I don't know

310
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,449
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that well if</font>

311
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,490
you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the letters that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make up our</font>

312
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:47,229
name unfortunately the look in the

313
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,410
middle one is bureau and

314
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,240
that is bureaucracy but believe it or

315
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:56,020
not we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do some things rapidly when</font>

316
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,250
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose to it's a matter of bringing</font>

317
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,890
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a high enough priority level</font>

318
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">honestly is that's one of the most</font>

319
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,180
wonderful things about the organization

320
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">is if necessary we can have 10,000</font>

321
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,280

322
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,630
is is it necessary and is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful so</font>

323
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,569
that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things I hope to get</font>

324
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:16,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of today was is this something where</font>

325
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,310
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could make it a quick enough</font>

326
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,010

continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be there and as we get that</font>

333
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:33,400
reduced somewhat I think we'll have a

334

smaller target set to look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

335
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,449
larger question is and one of the

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:41,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasons I'm here actually is if I</font>

receive a list of new amplifier sites

there a way i<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that is there a</font>

way to do that for instance some of the

list that collected knock contacts how

many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would be interested in</font>

357
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:31,300

358
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability of the FBI to keep</font>

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,729
that people who interact on the internet

360
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,670
and with with managers well trained and

361
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,960
in wealth staff if there's turnover you

362
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,339
know one of the problems that we've I've

363
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,580
had dealing with it was just that you

364
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get people who who really are</font>

365
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,270
spending their first hours in this field

366
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,700
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

367
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:53,380
cases you know just trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the</font>

368
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,720
best they can but they're not well<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

369
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:57,100
trained for the job absolutely we have a

370
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,260
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with training and retention just</font>

371
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,210
like everybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> does and if cisco</font>

372
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:08,860
would stop poaching our<font color="#CCCCCC"> san francisco</font>

373
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:10,540
squad we'd be even better off but in all

374
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">seriousness we do have a training and</font>

375
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,680
retention problem just like everybody

376
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:17,079
else who's got anybody who's worth their

377
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,300
salt we have some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font>

378
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,840
fantastically talented and actually

379
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,099
believe it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not for some unknown</font>

380
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:29,040
psychological reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> wha stay in the FBI</font>

381
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,040
as opposed to going<font color="#CCCCCC"> and making money but</font>

382
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,610
the way we approach that is try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get</font>

383
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,780
in the training<font color="#E5E5E5"> its best our aim in that</font>

384
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,370
area and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is diverging from my</font>

385
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,569
intent of topic is that they spend

386
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,880
twenty percent of their time in training

387
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:42,280
and what that training should consist of

388
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,500
is actually going where there is a good

389
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:46,510
relationship between a company and an

390
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:50,320
FBI field office and sitting with those

391
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:52,510
people and doing the job I don't hold a

392
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,790
degree in anything remotely related to

393
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,290
what i do now i have an economics degree

394
00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:00,339
which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> i came in count money</font>

395
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:01,689
properly but by sitting down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and doing</font>

396
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,970
the job for several years it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

397
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,110
best possible training<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could get and I</font>

398
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,400
think that's the kind of thing that we

399
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to get our agents involved in is</font>

400
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,520
get them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there and say hey this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

401
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">what my network looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this is the</font>

402
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">way it works this is the way these</font>

403
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:15,340
pieces fit together because then when

404
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:20,950
you talk about it later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this oh okay</font>

405
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:22,900
that makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense ma'am let's see if no</font>

406
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,630
one's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get up and make the</font>

407
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,060
slippery slope<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument I will about FBI</font>

408
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,880
involvement and technical issues of the

409
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:33,369
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was possible to</font>

410
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,920
separate technical from policy political

411
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:40,660
etc then I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself working for I</font>

412
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:42,160
can i no want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that as soon as</font>

413
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,439
there are mechanisms for dealing with

414
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:49,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things there's a problem defining</font>

415
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:53,470
the scope and it may look easy from here

416
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,330
to define operational technical it gets

417
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,930
much more complicated very quickly as

418
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,990
soon as you guys are involved

419
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:01,699
so let's be really careful about that

420
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's the kind of comment that I</font>

421
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:07,280
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear is how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can we draw the line</font>

422
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:08,870
is the line so blurry that we can't that

423
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,379
it would be inappropriate for us to do

424
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:15,649
so my object in this is to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

425
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,600

around the air which doesn't do any good

428

with this type of activity so that's the

00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,960
agents in general are generalists so it

471

may be difficult to to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the</font>

474
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,900
relatively well when we know who to talk

475
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:28,350
to me that's the key we have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

476
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:31,380
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way if if a knock of a company</font>

477
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:33,389
that's operated overseas is interested

478
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,429
in talking to us directly and talking to

479
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:39,210
them directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will tell you we will</font>

480
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:40,409
notify the legal access Jays office will

481
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,789
notify the host country's government

482
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:43,230
because we don't want to have a

483
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,970
government to private entity in another

484
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,029
country contact without the host country

485
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:51,779
knowing about it that's bad for

486
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:54,090
political reasons hi avi friedman from

487
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:57,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">Akamai which is my day job and net</font>

489
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:01,020
run a network and so I have some

490
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">network-based comments first a little</font>

491
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,799
point of nanog etiquette<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font>

492
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:08,279
you're just say major router vendor and

493
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:11,429
not Cisco what actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes again</font>

494
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:13,289
personal day my good people<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay no no</font>

495
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:18,960
major router vendors the only approved

496
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:20,580
way to refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the other so I have</font>

497
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,250
a quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> question which is that one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

498
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:25,289
we commonly do when one of our customers

499
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,730
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> smurfed is line up all the smurfs</font>

500
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:28,020
amplifiers in a row<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get them to</font>

501
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,880
Smurf each other because we've plenty

502
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,049
about them<font color="#E5E5E5"> been what to do that with so</font>

503
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was wondering whether you think that's</font>

504
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:33,720
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's legal or</font>

505
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:38,490
whether the FBI would get involved in

506
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:40,950
and then the real main point that I have

507
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:43,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did our position it is of course</font>

508
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:45,779
self-defense so but the bigger question

509
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:48,480
is it seems to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the big problem</font>

510
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:50,159
is not actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> Smurfs now I can filter</font>

511
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">Smurfs yeah people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

512
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,210
pings on my customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll make my tray</font>

513
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,360
swaps better d UDP trace route but

514
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:59,730
that's not as big a deal is actually you

515
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,178
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> non</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ford source you know or in some</font>

516
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:04,799
cases or the most cases forged source

517
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:07,620
directed attacks directed you know IP

518
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,960
attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP you know sins acts things</font>

519
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,320
like that and you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very</font>

520
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,370
controversial for<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanog topic about</font>

521
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,020
actually having the government<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

522
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,299
someone get upset about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to</font>

523
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,950
send forged source

524
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:20,658
and actually getting some shaming and

525
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:23,450
other things going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there I was</font>

526
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:25,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering don't do you see directed you</font>

527
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:27,259

528
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,570
for its source attacks is a bigger

529
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:31,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem and if so isn't that something</font>

530
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:33,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even better to try to</font>

531
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,149
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow although that is more of</font>

532
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,610
a technical issue and political issue of

533
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:39,139
it absolutely the answer is yes the vast

534
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:41,600
majority the attacks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see now are</font>

535
00:21:39,139 --> 00:21:43,129
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traditional Smurf style Smurf is</font>

536
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,080
just an easy one to point out and make

537
00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:48,350
an example of when we say okay should we

538
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,820
do something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a particular thing my</font>

539
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,408
first opinion is long as there's a

540
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,759
sequence of TTP flags that hasn't been

541
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:54,609
exercised to find out what it's going to

542
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:58,249
do nasty someone people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep doing it</font>

543
00:21:54,609 --> 00:22:00,619
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll eventually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocols</font>

544
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:01,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">evolved to prevent some of that yet but</font>

545
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:04,389
then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have new vulnerabilities pop</font>

546
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:08,029
up because if the way the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world works</font>

547
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:11,719
can we take steps to do ingress

548
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:14,389
filtering it's physically possible yes

549
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,570
in most instances people don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

550
00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:20,299
for one reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> or another I'm not going</font>

551
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:23,059
to get into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular religious</font>

552
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:25,070
argument because it is to some people

553
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:28,269
and major router vendors have a hard

554
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,269
time with it but

555
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:34,870
then doors vendors in seriousness yes

556
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,669
see the bigger problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> now is not</font>

557
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,439
traditional<font color="#CCCCCC"> Smurf it is other types of</font>

558
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,730
attacks and any situations where we get

559
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,900
notification of that and that's what I'm

560
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,190
talking about with networks of

561
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,950
amplifiers as opposed to the traditional

562
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:47,230
Smurf amplifier networks of zombies

563
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:49,360
drones whatever your particular word of

564
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,530
choice for that day is those are the

565
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones where I think we can affect the</font>

566
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,470
most change when we find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> about them</font>

567
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,600

00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,220
what I'm actually trying to talk about

627
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,200
is what is the best way to get that

information to them to get them to

629

change their behavior and if us doing it

sister services and overseas places go

641
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:47,189
and visit the people and see how they

642
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,500
react and then come back and say well

be the line drawn in the sand it says

00:27:32,029 --> 00:27:34,940
don't cross this please or else we're

but that kind of approach is probably

00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:44,059
the best possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> outcome I can see is</font>

691
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:46,490
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> people get together and say hey</font>

692
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:47,658
this kind of activities got to stop here

693
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:49,039
that or we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to appear with</font>

you or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that effect whether</font>

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,600
it will come to that is a business

<font color="#CCCCCC">decision frankly it does this do enough</font>

damage to my network that I can say not

698
00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:02,210
peering with that network is worth the

00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:40,580
to beat<font color="#E5E5E5"> those unnamed backbone vendors</font>

713
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:45,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">are they if you want to comment on what</font>

714
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:47,119
that phrase should be we have to figure

715
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:49,100
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of convincing them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

716
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,980
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clean up their networks and they</font>

717
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,418
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> educate their customers to get</font>

718
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,659
those things cleaned up and they need to

719
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:58,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">take it in a proactive otherwise I think</font>

720
00:28:56,659 --> 00:29:00,769
we will find<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there will be a dot</font>

721
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:02,749
gov involvement to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a greater extent than</font>

722
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:05,210
what we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see I think we</font>

723
00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:07,490
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an ability to to police that we</font>

724
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:10,759
have the technology we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the cpu</font>

725
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:12,649
horsepower etc etc to do that what it

726
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:15,799
takes is us making a conscious effort to

727
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:18,229
go forth and to do that um but

728
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:20,200
publishing the list is wonderful as mr.

729
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:22,460
Bell oven says it helps the smokers arm

730
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,009
it helps some of us that look at those

731
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:28,519
lists but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have people that</font>

732
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:31,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't take any action on those lists so</font>

733
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:32,659
what absolutely I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> strongly</font>

734
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,490
encourage and I'm speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> more to the</font>

audience than I am to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gentleman on</font>

00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:39,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">the podium that if you run in that make</font>

737
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:42,289
sure your network doesn't allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

738
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:45,949
things to happen fix it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to say</font>

739
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:50,119
otherwise is almost criminal in a sense

740
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:54,980
of association in a sense thank you

741
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:56,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you you know we've spent a whole</font>

742
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,330
lot of time talking about closing

743
00:29:56,869 --> 00:30:00,830
amplifiers and doing all the all the

744
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:03,439
stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing in order</font>

745
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:06,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">to stop these attacks from being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

746
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen and I'm all for that but the one</font>

747
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,660
thing we haven't really talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is</font>

748
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:13,280
what happens when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FBI in cooperation</font>

749
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:15,590
the service provider actually catches

750
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,440
one of these people doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these</font>

751
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:19,939
attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and hopefully other people's</font>

752
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,950
experience has been different<font color="#E5E5E5"> than mine</font>

753
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,990
but about now three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago actually</font>

754
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,090
caught one and there was undeniable

755
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:28,430
proof that this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> person was</font>

756
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:30,949
doing this particular attack and that

757
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:33,620
was three years ago and as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

758
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:36,200
an FBI<font color="#CCCCCC"> agent hasn't even been by to</font>

759
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:38,030
visit the person let alone any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

760
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,100
prosecution or anything else happening

761
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:42,530
so we're really sending a message out to

762
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,790
this to the script kiddies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll go</font>

763
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,290
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do what you want because even</font>

764
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:47,050
if we know who you are we catch<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

765
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:51,470
nothing can ever happen to you and

766
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:52,610
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a definite problem one of the</font>

767
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point out about</font>

768
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:58,459
that is changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in legislation since</font>

769
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:00,530
then a lot of what we previously did as

770
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,480
enforcement action was predicated on

771
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:04,760
laws that made it very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to</font>

772
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">number one convince an assistant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font>

774
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,900
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> indictment or prosecution that there</font>

is a viable<font color="#E5E5E5"> case the second is that</font>

776
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:18,950
horrific issue of damages most of the

777
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,570
governmental<font color="#CCCCCC"> prosecutor process hinges</font>

778
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,190
on the idea that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a monetary</font>

779
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,020
damage you can assign to anything and

780
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,940
that's very very tough in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

781
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,850
situations what I would invite<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to do</font>

782
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,880
is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> email me anonymously if you wish</font>

00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:33,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">but otherwise if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can with</font>

information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about where the contact was</font>

785
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:37,400
and that kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I would</font>

786
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,780
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to follow up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on them secondarily a</font>

787
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,700
point goes back to an original comment

788
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,800
that somebody made about training a lot

789
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problems we've had that are very</font>

790
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,940
real that you've experienced have been

791
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:48,950
directly result of sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cross I</font>

792
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">effect you try and explain something to</font>

793
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,000
it somebody in an enforcement position

794
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,230
in their eyes girl hey because they're

795
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really sure about what you're</font>

796
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:59,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been significantly</font>

797
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:02,930
changing the the technical outlook on

798
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:05,350
life on a lot of FBI agents a lot means

799
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:08,570
a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred in an agency it's got</font>

800
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:11,030
30,000 people in it that's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font>

801
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:12,770
to get across the entire population<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

802
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,850
would posit that if you're in certain

803
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:15,530
areas right now if you're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

804
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,750
Washington DC area if you're in the San

805
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:21,080
Francisco area until some large router

806
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:22,590
vendor went on a party you would have

807
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">very good response</font>

808
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:27,000
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the last couple of years</font>

809
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,139
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been problems absolutely</font>

810
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,820
there have been problems absolutely

811
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,590
there has been coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the other</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">endeavouring to change that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

815
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:41,100
thing it's important is if a field

816
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:43,379
office does not give you the response

817
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:46,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need you should always call FBI</font>

818
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,700
headquarters in this case the national

819
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,860
infrastructure protection Center is the

820
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,870
party responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> running field</font>

821
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:56,070
office investigated programs i will say

822
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:57,870
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a whole the field agents are</font>

823
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,789
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> wonderful they have good</font>

824
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:02,370
people skills they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough about</font>

825
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:05,580
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they will at least not</font>

826
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:06,989
go catatonic on you are they the the

827
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,120
geniuses who can run their own networks

828
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:11,159
some of them are some of them definitely

829
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,299
are not in which case we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the</font>

830
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:14,309
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who do have the technical skills</font>

831
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:16,470
to sit with them when they're talking to

832
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:19,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">you and also you can do a lot to help</font>

833
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:22,590
yourself by toning the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information that</font>

834
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:24,419
you provide into such a manner that is

835
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,549
comprehensible it's a lot easier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

836
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,169
to talk about things with certain types

of people than<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is for other agents on</font>

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:57,360
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get anywhere because he</font>

851
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,439
couldn't justify the amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> damages</font>

852
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,199
like you were saying it was like a

853
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,970
five-thousand-dollar number and while we

854
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,250
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> easily say well you know we may</font>

855
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,720
have lost a million customers because of

856
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,799
this attack and all costs way more than

857
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,780
five thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars that kind of</font>

858
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:12,179
reasoning doesn't count the the amount

859
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,379
of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> it took and broken things is all</font>

860
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,700
that they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> count towards at five</font>

861
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:17,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">thousand we can only come up with like</font>

862
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:20,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">thirty five hundred dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

863
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,730
stretching hard fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can prove this</font>

864
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:25,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of monetary damage kind of issues</font>

865
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:28,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that and that's that was the problem</font>

866
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:32,199
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mark on this</font>

867
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:34,748
we get my case yeah just to speak to

868
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:36,819
that the administration introduced

869
00:34:34,748 --> 00:34:38,529
legislation earlier this year which

870
00:34:36,819 --> 00:34:40,748
among other things would have amended

871
00:34:38,529 --> 00:34:44,440
precisely that part of the statute to

872
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:46,480
provide jurisdiction<font color="#E5E5E5"> is 1030 a fight a</font>

873
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,190
is the particular sub sub sub section of

874
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,319
the statute I would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> created at</font>

875
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,579
least a misdemeanor offense for less

876
00:34:50,319 --> 00:34:55,538
than five thousand dollars would have

877
00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:57,400
been graduated levels of punishment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

878
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:58,989
bill I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fair to say has really</font>

879
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,589
not gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> anywhere it was introduced by</font>

880
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:04,359
Senator Leahy by request but it is not

881
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:06,640
going to be passed this session it's a

882
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:09,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem we're aware of and we do feel</font>

883
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,440
strongly there are a lot of offenses

884
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:13,059
where even though the the monetary

885
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,309
amount may not hit that threshold that

886
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:17,259
there is a substantial prosecute of

887
00:35:15,309 --> 00:35:18,910
interest and sometimes we just have me

888
00:35:17,259 --> 00:35:21,339
wait we have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> way under current law to</font>

889
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:23,259
pursue that I mean remember in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case</font>

890
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:25,450
it wasn't just that data that it wasn't

891
00:35:23,259 --> 00:35:27,009
that there's a monetary amount that we

892
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,899
couldn't need to measure that regulation

893
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:30,789
it wasn't a hard monetary amount it

894
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,499
wasn't a provable monetary amount right

895
00:35:30,789 --> 00:35:35,739
because you go and attack my network and

896
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:37,359
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep take it down for 12 hours you</font>

897
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:38,680
know there's lost revenue there but the

898
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,910
lost revenue doesn't count because I

899
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,950
can't prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have otherwise</font>

900
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:44,049
made that revenue yeah I would just say

901
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:46,239
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> words beyond reasonable doubt</font>

902
00:35:44,049 --> 00:35:48,190
that's the hurdle we have to get over

903
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:49,599
for every element of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an offense so we</font>

904
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,789
would have to prove<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in a court of</font>

905
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,859
law or at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least persuade somebody's</font>

906
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:56,170
defense counsel that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could in order</font>

907
00:35:53,859 --> 00:36:00,359
to make them fold and plead guilty so it

908
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:00,359
is in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it gets converted for us</font>

909
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:09,840
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay concrete question time up</font>

910
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:12,300
here if I were to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> information that</font>

911
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:15,720
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be pushed out to customers of ISPs</font>

00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">something someone would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font>

with our<font color="#CCCCCC"> infragard program and that's</font>

930
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,510
we looked at 16 hours later<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 20 hours</font>

931
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:08,670

have those so if you are interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

933
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:13,080
doing that providing that information to

935
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,880
in a timely fashion that would be

936
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,880
wonderful

937
00:37:20,109 --> 00:37:28,490
um there is as far as i can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> susan</font>

938
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:32,150
is holding up a piece of cheese as you

939
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:36,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">can see oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've exceeded my time limit</font>

940
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:38,869
on the microphone there is no it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

941
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:42,589
with a long time ago there is no

942
00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:46,599
requirement there is no expectation in

943
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:49,369
any of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet documentation to</font>

944
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:55,190
stand up information<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a who is or who</font>

945
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:56,930
is type service and so if this community

946
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:59,119
thought that an operational

947
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:01,940
recommendation would be that there was

948
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:06,020
an opt-in service where they agreed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

949
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:07,790
run either their own data I'm a firm

950
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,980
believer if people own their own data

951
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:12,440
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to keep it up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> date as</font>

952
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:14,000
opposed to pushing it to some central

953
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,650
repository someplace where they will

954
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,609
forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and or somebody will</font>

955
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:21,230
start charging them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the current</font>

956
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:22,910
that if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an opt-in service that</font>

957
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,800
that might get you where you want to go

958
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:28,640
if people thought that that was

959
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,470
important otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I'm going to have</font>

960
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,400
to pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody to keep the data current</font>

961
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:35,810
in whois database somewhere else the

962
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,420
likelihood of<font color="#E5E5E5"> me doing that's going to</font>

963
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:43,640
be diminishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee smaller so I agree</font>

964
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,140
anything he gets pushed<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a database</font>

965
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,640
is usually out of data as soon as the

966
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,900
push is complete I mean all you have to

967
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:52,910
do is look at some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine Nick handles</font>

968
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:54,680
and a little stale I think I've hit the

969
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:57,140
end of the time I'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to talk to</font>

970
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:00,290
anybody who'd like to outside or in the

971
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:04,368
back and I do encourage people to email

972
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:09,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">me estimated FBI gov is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the email</font>

973
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:13,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">address and for those who who feel it's</font>

974
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:16,879
so necessary I do have PGP keys up on

975
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:19,970
MIT ski server and we can exchange

976
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,319
fingerprints if you're interested that's

977
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:23,828
it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much for your time</font>

978
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:23,829
I appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

979
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:30,809
one last statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I at least get</font>

980
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:30,809
some smiles
