1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is a panel discussion which</font>

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,010
actually kind of next week published in

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,540
that last question which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of nice</font>

4
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:14,399
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get to that a</font>

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,540
minute this idea for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this panel came</font>

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,980
about because there was just a

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,680
discussion and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd list right after</font>

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the relative</font>

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">merits of ATM versus ethernet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vs all</font>

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,509
sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other stuff for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> building</font>

11
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,130
exchange points somebody suggested the

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,990
art of Iannetta talk about it so I

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,369
naturally volunteered to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the least work</font>

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,449
possible which was to moderate a panel

15
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:38,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that other people do the talking so</font>

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,820
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some questions that we could</font>

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,559
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here what should the exchange</font>

18
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,399
plan providers be building here ethernet

19
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:50,879
ATM something else we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some talents</font>

20
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,010
of study is on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what is possible</font>

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,660
with some of the new stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's coming</font>

22
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,269
down the road the optical domain

23
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,160
especially and then this course there's

24
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,899
the question of what dude appearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> isp</font>

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,898
is really neat out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> at exchange point</font>

26
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,560
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do here by the</font>

27
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,960
way is talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the political aspects</font>

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">appearing like we should pier with who</font>

29
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,619
and why and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort of thing that's</font>

30
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,820
really beyond the scope of this so don't

31
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:20,700
ask those questions we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought of me</font>

32
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,979
some architectural questions this is the

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,560
internet versus ATM one but Len can be

34
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,439
fiddy or can be 10 gig Ethernet or

35
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,820
whatever virtual circuits could be a

36
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">team from Ely and pls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> safe you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

37
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,309
more wheel circuits like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sonic</font>

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,079
cross-connect like<font color="#CCCCCC"> an Randy's proposal</font>

39
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,820
so what's better there do we want a

40
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,229
model where everything is co-located and

41
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,500
you talk across the building<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the UN</font>

42
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">to model where you're appearing with</font>

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,170
people who are not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

44
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,110
same building as you across the metro

45
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,850
region for example and kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

46
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,679
extension<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is do you want the</font>

47
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,820
exchange fabric to be centralized to one

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,920
place or distributed among multiple

49
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,919
locations if you distribute it how do

50
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,979
you do that effectively so I bottlenecks

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,380
for instance I'm all sorts of cool new

52
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:12,690
stuff this cheap dark fiber we can buy

53
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:16,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">now there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Metro DWDM is reasonable and</font>

54
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,750
getting cheaper there's mpls everybody's

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,030
favorite buzzword 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gigabit Ethernet is</font>

56
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,980
almost real OC 192 is almost real

57
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,770
depending who you buy it from and then

58
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,149
there's this thing called IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> over glass</font>

59
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:35,340
or fiber or whatever how could that be

60
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:38,370
is if it means anything at all some of

61
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,900
the questions can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually buy the</font>

62
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,380
equipment you need to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exchange</font>

63
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,940
out of do you care<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's you buy</font>

64
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,120
something that's coming off the shelf or

65
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,530
are you willing to invest in or try<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

66
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,590
something from an emerging provider and

67
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,810
see how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes in terms of</font>

68
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,480
reliability do does the industry need

69
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:00,060
five nines this is not an<font color="#CCCCCC"> air of</font>

70
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion few weeks ago we really need</font>

71
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:07,890
the five nines of reliability or is the

72
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:11,160
appearing architecture overall good

73
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:15,450
enough to survive a reasonable length

74
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,739
outage of saying an hour and scalability

75
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,899
is an issue of course how do you grow

76
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:23,310
these things when the biggest which gets

77
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,110
full what do you do next so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

78
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">start off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> families giving</font>

79
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,000
fairly short talks on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the order of 10</font>

80
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,920
minutes each about what's it interested

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,390
them in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> area and then we'll have an</font>

82
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,649
open discussion question answer period

83
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:40,649
after that the panelists are Paul Dixie

84
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,780
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> mfn they'll send our know from</font>

85
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,070
canary Lane Patterson from<font color="#CCCCCC"> equinix and</font>

86
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,900
mike hughes from links and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

87
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:49,430
invited Tom to<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and help field</font>

88
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,320
the questions later try to get some

89
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,910
representation from both<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP world and</font>

90
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,190
the exchange point provider world in the

91
00:03:53,910 --> 00:04:01,109
research part of the world so hopefully

92
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:03,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'll be interesting broadview here so</font>

93
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,190
let's see who's decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go with the</font>

94
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,680
order<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the printed agenda here so let</font>

95
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:10,670
me look that up and according to this

96
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,670
all they see is first

97
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:40,380
hello and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start by saying that</font>

98
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,060
I'm very<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad to be here and not talking</font>

99
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">about spam its first time in a while</font>

100
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:55,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so moving right along the couple of</font>

101
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,410
things were either<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing or thinking</font>

102
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,080
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it packs to take advantage</font>

103
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:09,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the cool stuff that Steve</font>

104
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:17,060
said on his slide the excuse me virus

105
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:17,060
protection yeah we can have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

106
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:23,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I guess you're all going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it</font>

107
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:27,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">now so the the big data mover inside of</font>

108
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:30,180
any packs is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PN I and what that is</font>

109
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,070
is a piece of dark fiber or copper that

110
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,230
goes through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wiring plant but</font>

111
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,870
basically caged cage it has no active

112
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:40,550
tax equipment or any telco equipment

113
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:43,410
it's just two people one appear and you

114
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we provide the media to do that and</font>

115
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hell out of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way and</font>

116
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:51,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know we charge a nominal monthly fee</font>

117
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,130
for this the fee doesn't really mean

118
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,770
obviously we're not rebinding the media

119
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:57,510
every month but we are walking the cable

120
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,580
plant making sure that the database is

121
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,280
up to date at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the labels are haven't</font>

122
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,680
fallen off and so forth so it's it's a

123
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,619
they managed service at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that level but</font>

124
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,720
it's too low<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a fee that we hardly</font>

125
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:14,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever hear complaints about people having</font>

126
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:17,180
to pay for monthly fees on<font color="#CCCCCC"> PN</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is so one</font>

127
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,500
of the things we're thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

128
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,710
actually this came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the discussion</font>

129
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,500
with Vince fuller some years ago where

130
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,989
he didn't necessarily want to have to do

131
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,510
full mesh pni in order to do full mesh

132
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:32,910
private peering but he really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to</font>

133
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:35,780
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> either interface or sub interface /</font>

134
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:38,790
Pierre for various things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like quote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISM</font>

135
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,460
and tracking and whatnot he just it

136
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:44,310
seemed to Vince at that time that we

137
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,370
were a little bit to open with you know

138
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:51,780
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole</font>

139
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:54,580
a subnet topology so after<font color="#E5E5E5"> some years of</font>

140
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,469
changing switch vendors and learning how

141
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">to operate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs and without we're</font>

142
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:02,110
finally going to offer<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> private VLAN</font>

143
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,860
service may or may not be called the

144
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,210
virtual network interconnect because

145
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,419
make certain people want to cough up a

146
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:12,460
lung when they see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but what what</font>

147
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:14,889
that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be is a VLAN with exactly two</font>

148
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,109
ports as members so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

149
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,940
replacement<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the pni so that you</font>

150
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,250
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dedicate a port in order</font>

151
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:25,419
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dedicated connection tues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

152
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,800
some other peer and once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in</font>

153
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:29,770
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to turn on</font>

154
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,970
tagging on your port and as soon as that

155
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,639
happens you'll find that there are

156
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:38,280
already two vlans out there because we

157
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,280
separated multicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> into its own VLAN</font>

158
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:45,840
what could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font>

159
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,370
what does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all mean I'm sorry that's</font>

160
00:07:49,430 --> 00:08:00,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end of my presentation it looks like</font>

161
00:07:51,370 --> 00:08:04,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well i suppose i could just reboot</font>

162
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:08,479
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> nevermind ok so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't</font>

163
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:10,789
show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you is called metro packs and that</font>

164
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:16,068
again takes advantage of some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the new</font>

165
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:19,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool stuff that was on Steve slide as</font>

166
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:21,380
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know mfn is digging up the</font>

167
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:26,120
street in<font color="#CCCCCC"> front of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your building for</font>

168
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:28,669
large values of you and building so we

169
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,520
have about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 cities operational now and</font>

170
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:36,458
we're digging up about 67 more worldwide

171
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:44,899
and putting in pretty dense<font color="#CCCCCC"> Metro fiber</font>

172
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:46,699
so they us have as the the big selling

173
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:50,240
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that fiber that you can get</font>

174
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,550
point-to-point<font color="#E5E5E5"> Metro dark fiber for</font>

175
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,010
either for your own use or for peering

176
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,260
user anything you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

177
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,319
can buy it from us on a 17 year contract

178
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:02,149
sometimes less sometimes more and once

179
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,110
you have it boy it's dark fiber you can

180
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:09,520
either run raw Giggy over it or you can

181
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:14,390
do w DM you can do anything you want

182
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:16,399
however this vni concept extends pretty

183
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:19,970
nicely there sometimes people want to

184
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,560
peer with other folks in the metro but

185
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,779
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to buy a dedicated</font>

186
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,790
strand to each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> either because they</font>

187
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,200
don't have enough bandwidth or they

188
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,930
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough ports or whatever</font>

189
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,130
their reason so there's a fairly good

190
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:37,790
chance that packs will stick a switch

191
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,620
into each<font color="#E5E5E5"> mfn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> City just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the purpose</font>

192
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,270
of selling something very similar to

193
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's on this slide but in the metro</font>

194
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:47,000
area so that you can either<font color="#CCCCCC"> appear with</font>

195
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,469
people without dragging your network

196
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,079
down to the packs more unless you can

197
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:55,490
drag the tax network to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> over MF ends</font>

198
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:56,739
dark fiber or you can set up a private

199
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:01,540
VLAN between you and

200
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:03,940
them now I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this real short</font>

201
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:07,390
have a lot more talks to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

202
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:09,010
say one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our switch vendors is in the</font>

203
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:12,520
audience today and he's already heard me

204
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:17,560
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> this the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> switch ever made was</font>

205
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:19,480
the dell me and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could get a switch</font>

206
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:23,640
vendor to give me a special<font color="#E5E5E5"> download</font>

207
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:27,190
that had no routing no qos no quotas no

208
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,600
nothing just<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me a switch with a lot</font>

209
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,190
of gigabit ethernet ports and a

210
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,860
backplane fast enough to handle it

211
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,959
that's that's the 1i by i would i would

212
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,940
preferentially choose a switch vendor

213
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,920
based on that feature alone however

214
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is no switch vendor who's willing</font>

215
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,839
to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me because apparently I'd</font>

216
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,700
be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only customer but what it will</font>

217
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,279
say is that switches did switch and

218
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,580
router should route and having either

219
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:50,580
one

220
00:10:53,430 --> 00:11:01,770
try to do the other has been an endless

221
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:05,339
endless pain in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> heinie so another</font>

222
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:08,250
feature we have asked for is just to

223
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:11,520
please not learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> MAC addresses or to</font>

224
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:15,000
learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one a lot of our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> customers</font>

225
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:19,020
use a complex layer to layer with layer

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">3 topology to attach to us and to each</font>

227
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,520
other and if enough of them all do this

228
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:26,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's pretty easy for a bridge loop to</font>

229
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,439
come around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back side or for us to</font>

230
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,180
see spanning tree from a customer or see

231
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,029
our own spanning tree back from another

232
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,829
customer so turning off all that

233
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:38,010
spanning tree nonsense and only being

234
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:40,920
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn one mac address / port</font>

235
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,660
and then filter any traffic from that

236
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,630
port that does not come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

237
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,670
mac address is something that right now

238
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,270
we do manually we do static

239
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:53,099
configurations static filtering static

240
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:56,010
MAC address to port mappings and whatnot

241
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,700
and it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

242
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:01,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">us if the customer were allowed to</font>

243
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:05,610
change the equipment on the end of their

244
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:07,650
of their line on the port<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they have</font>

245
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">on our switch without having to tell us</font>

246
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:13,250
what the new mac address will be however

247
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:16,440
without that kind of draconian filtering

248
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:18,570
you will see the periodic meltdowns that

249
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,770
have plagued links this<font color="#E5E5E5"> year and have</font>

250
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:24,959
played us in in years past you just the

251
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:27,510
this the switching stuff is not robust

252
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,390
it's very delicate it's designed around

253
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:32,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea that one mis manager owns the</font>

254
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,110
switch and everything that's attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

255
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that does not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fly in my</font>

256
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:41,160
environment and so we need a little bit

257
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:43,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">more a little bit more conservatism in</font>

258
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,760
our design there it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just it has to be</font>

259
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,980
designed around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea that the other</font>

260
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">guy's an idiot no offense to our</font>

261
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,250
customers

262
00:12:48,620 --> 00:13:03,980
so that's my presentation I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

263
00:12:52,250 --> 00:13:05,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">reboot this now I think Paul's</font>

264
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,300
presentations and they situate into what

265
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:09,920
I'll be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about here for those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

266
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,540
aren't familiar with us we're the

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,410
Canadian equivalent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to and</font>

268
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,599
we've been working on next generation

269
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,000
optical networks and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our current</font>

which is an extract with 150 slide deck

00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,310
around with some neat things and so what

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:06,380
developing a new protocol or variants of

296
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,950
to build an optical internet exchange

297
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:22,910
point using combinations of dark fiber

298
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:24,680
and DWDM technology and the key

299

<font color="#E5E5E5">out there building optical switches and</font>

provide electrical power to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the switch</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP so as Paul saying there's lots of</font>

call course weight division multiplexing

ISPs with their multiple wavelengths in

323

<font color="#CCCCCC">more simpler and to automate the entire</font>

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,240
around that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really make it very very</font>

343
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,400
we hope to have fully operational in a

few weeks it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just strictly</font>

345
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,329
proof-of-concept to show and demonstrate

346
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,860
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these things and then we hope</font>

347

some of the major road vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in</font>

customer but essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it does is</font>

351
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,939
take that optical cross connect and make

352
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,160
it look like a BGP speaking router but

353
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,260
so really a proxy this process is

354
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:37,040
running back on your main<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU server</font>

355
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:40,490
miles away but<font color="#E5E5E5"> allows them to proxy to</font>

356
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">both sides link state addresses loopback</font>

357
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,780
address is so forth and so it's mixed

358
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:46,220
this makes a much simpler for both

359
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,680
priorities and their config statements

360
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,540
to configure a router get the appearing

361
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,739

362
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">other in fact it can even be done</font>

363
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:57,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">asynchronously we hope where you can say</font>

368
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,440

376
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple and we think this will choose</font>

377
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,680
this which guarantees you a path because

378
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,990
it's a light path we're using Giggy

379
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,090
channels but soon we hope you can get

380
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,380
channels from one peer to another so

381
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,810
there's no multiplexing and traffic

382
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,290
nothing like that and we also think it

383
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:41,360
would be a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful mechanism for a</font>

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,020
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other big advantage which we</font>

387
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,630
hope this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow is to mass</font>

388

428
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:28,220
communities building dark fiber networks

429
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:32,090
like Paul mentioned and who want a

430
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:34,430
switch to exchange traffic you cannot

431
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:37,159
mesh fiber it's physically impossible to

432
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,690
mesh fiber to 100 sites but you want to

433
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">exchange traffic but you don't want to</font>

434
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,710
go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the old model of having some</font>

435
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,320
large aggregator or telco in the middle

436
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so this is where we first thought of</font>

437
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">this concept in Ottawa we're building</font>

438
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,530
something called condominium<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber</font>

439
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,940
network linking 26 institutions and we

440
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,460
all said we don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

441
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,870
old telco model no matter how benign can

442
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,310
we build a device allows us to

443
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,469
interchange traffic and<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer with each</font>

444
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,810
other and nobody in the middle that's

445
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,130
essentially what we're trying to achieve

446
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:06,800
now we're also seeing a lot of fiber

447
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:08,120
companies now a new types of carriers

448
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,460
out there who are only in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber</font>

449
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,320
business metromedia<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's a bunch</font>

450
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">of others out there who want to offer</font>

451
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,310
value-added service and we think this

452
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,990
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be one possibility but don't want to</font>

453
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,720
get into the traditional service stack

454
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,850
and finally there's all the colocation

455
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,200
companies like to pay for example and so

456
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:26,570
forth where we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this may be a</font>

457
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,470
possibility for<font color="#CCCCCC"> next generation IX</font>

458
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:32,659
capability so right now the standard

459
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,130
stuff on how you do peering today but

460
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,760
setting up these optical switches will

461
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:41,030
allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do direct no default but no</font>

462
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,640
cost peering but it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP to</font>

463
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:46,250
the end user simply looks like standard

464
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,220
BGP there's no change in architectural

465
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:51,860
new technology and allows you also to

466
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,140
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers very easily and quickly so</font>

467
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:56,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you may in this example have a now set</font>

468
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">up direct peering between s 1 and s 4</font>

469
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:02,179
and bypass<font color="#E5E5E5"> AF three but because based on</font>

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,040
a large a s flow but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some future date</font>

471
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,840
you may say<font color="#CCCCCC"> jeez my ass flows have</font>

472
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,450
changed or business relationships will

474
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:14,420

are set up in response to the BGP

stablish the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP peering then let lat</font>

486
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:41,120
this is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> very you know conceptual</font>

487
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,919
very experimental there's bound to be

488
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,320
some pitfalls we don't know does it

489
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:48,679
scale all sorts of issues but we think

490
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:50,600
it's an intriguing concept and we'll

491
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:52,280
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> you abreast of how it develops and</font>

if anybody's interested in further

information or participating in the

494

development of this protocol it's

495
00:21:55,549 --> 00:22:02,090
actually very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple just a few</font>

all the technologies in general past

itself to a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> control in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tui with</font>

506
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:59,070
quite a bit of management overhead to do

507
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:03,629
that shared media the most recent being

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basic sonic cross connect I</font>

510
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:15,959
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> self-explanatory</font>

511
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:18,529
as well applications that we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> add to</font>

512
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:22,139
exchange points multicast unicast

513
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:24,450
private and public hearing and then some

514
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:26,100
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really maybe have some</font>

515
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,340
potential to be seen at<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange points</font>

516
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:32,178
but haven't happened yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what we're</font>

517
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:35,220
doing this kind of our new thing is

518
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:39,509
we're finally doing Gigabit Ethernet at

519
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:43,139
equinix we're doing the one big unicast

520
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:45,029
vln model with a mix of private vlans

521
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:51,059
and tagged interfaces being fine too so

522
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:52,830
Paul talked about that earlier there's

523
00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:56,100
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shared risk when you're on</font>

524
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:59,100
a broadcast domain with somebody on a

525
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,529
large VLAN so you mitigate that in two

526
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,350
ways one is by having policies and

527
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:06,210
enforcing them at<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange points in the</font>

528
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:11,549
second is with the filters and knobs on

529
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:13,259
your routers in our switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think one</font>

530
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:16,080
of the reasons we kind of moved over

531
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:19,230
towards Giggy there's obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost and</font>

532
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,730
simplicity advantages but one of the

533
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,649
other reasons was traffic control

534
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:28,200
features now make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of less</font>

535
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:29,928
onerous to be on a ethernet switch there

536
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,070
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an issue I want to bring up and</font>

537
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:34,619
there's been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of debate over into</font>

538
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:38,668
you but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of data so this is</font>

539
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:40,540
kind of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> request for people to talk to</font>

540
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:44,200
about data for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

541
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:47,649
specifically of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is greater</font>

542
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:50,350
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1500 in the core what's in it and</font>

543
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:53,040
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of into end applications and</font>

544
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,120
characteristics does it represent

545
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,070
there's definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> a path to moving</font>

546
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,830
towards bigger empty use at gigabit

547
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:00,909
ethernet if you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a mixed</font>

548
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,919
into your environment there's some

549
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:05,770
things that have to happen for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to</font>

550
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:08,830
take place and that's for<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts routers</font>

551
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:13,030
and switches to basically support MTU /

552
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:17,280
/ tag and we're not quite there on that

553
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:19,480
yet this slide is basically things that

554
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,060
participants would do on their routers

555
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,610
to mitigate some of the issues on a

556
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,169
broadcast fabric and I think it's

557
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:30,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">self-explanatory most people are</font>

558
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:31,720
familiar with this so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our side</font>

559
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,419
there's two things to point out on this

560
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide and that's some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

improvements coming down the road<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

562
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,910
spanning tree for millisecond

563

convergence out of the 802 that 1w

564
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:44,530
working group and there's one vendor

565
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:48,879
already claiming support for that in

566
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:51,180
their products the second is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability</font>

00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:02,500
that's that feature is there already<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

570
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:04,240

571
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,400
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> point on this slide is is basically</font>

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,530
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more ability to add more</font>

575
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:16,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you start to lose some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the simplicity</font>

576
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,400
of why you went with a shared VLAN

577
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:20,200
fabric in the first place and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

578
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:23,380
point we really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

579
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:25,630
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an MDMA model and that can be</font>

future Giggy developments again this is

583
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:38,460
pretty self-explanatory except on the

584
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:41,549
multicast side right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now for multicast</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">VLANs we're still doing port flooding to</font>

586
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:47,250
give that multicast traffic across and

587
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:52,110
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of intelligence we can</font>

588
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:54,179
do a lot better so that's what we're

589
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,049
doing what we're tracking and testing

590
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to go through these pretty</font>

591

595
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,360

599
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,210
that's kind of interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font>

600
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,260
represents the opposite end of the

603
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,769
up connections and to be honest that's

604
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:28,320
where people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do their traffic</font>

617
00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:03,330
do a seamless ATM frame fabric and so

618
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,190
basically on that there are a couple

619
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:08,220
switches out there that have reasonable

620
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,990
numbers of 48 and 192 ports your paws

624
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:20,490
in their network which brings me to my

625
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:22,168
next point which is LS<font color="#E5E5E5"> RS I think right</font>

626
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:26,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">now they basically need a little bit</font>

627
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:28,500
more momentum but there's certainly a

628
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,710
lot of potential in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this area so we're</font>

629
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:34,260
testing these as well I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if some of</font>

630
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:36,600
the killer apps kind of take off for

631
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,820
mpls in the interdomain space there's a

632
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,699
real good case for running some Ellis

633
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,629
ours

634
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,520
so we've looked at a couple different

635
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,290
models I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think any of them are</font>

636
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:53,810
satisfactory yet in the interdomain

637
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:57,690
space so my last<font color="#E5E5E5"> point optical switching</font>

638
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:59,909
as built already talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

639
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:02,460
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to a certain critical mass</font>

640
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:06,180
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> wavelengths per customer and dark</font>

641
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:10,100
fiber strands for customer density these

642
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,850
optical switches are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> attractive and</font>

643
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,439
one of the reasons they would be

644
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,469
attractive is for some of the dynamic

645
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,010
signaling that you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> over this type of</font>

646
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:22,770
an architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> without that</font>

647
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:25,379
you've basically got the equivalent of a

648
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,940
dark fiber cross connect so it's not too

649
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,130
exciting<font color="#E5E5E5"> without some of the dynamic</font>

650
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:33,360
signaling features that you get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

651
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:36,900
the state<font color="#CCCCCC"> the GM pls group so for today</font>

652
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,939
sort of the practical version of doing

653
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,170
wavelength exchange is for people to

654
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring in their own dark fiber and their</font>

655
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:47,250
own<font color="#CCCCCC"> dwm s and do private dark fiber</font>

656
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:48,659
cross connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> i throw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up a slide here</font>

657
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:52,650
on virtual devices but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think bills</font>

658
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:54,210
kind of covered this already just with

659
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:57,870
respect to exchange points i think the

660
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:59,580
concepts here are pretty interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

661
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:02,969
it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything from sort of the</font>

662
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:06,949
route server are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> model to a real</font>

663
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,950
virtual device like bill mentioned

664
00:30:09,199 --> 00:30:15,149
so my last two thoughts are for exchange

665
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:17,519
points what are the drivers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

666
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:20,129
really pushing our technology today

667
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:23,039
we've got some<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty awesome</font>

668
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:24,809
capabilities in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the core and they have</font>

669
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,779
big implications for the interdomain

670
00:30:24,809 --> 00:30:29,519
space it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a pretty exciting</font>

671
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:33,419
ride to see how fast we can burn those

672
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,949
wavelengths and other than just Rob

673
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:37,319
bandwidth I think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

674
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:40,789
energy main services that are kind of

675
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:45,299
waiting in the wings that are poised to

676
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:48,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">be adopted and so what kind of boxes</font>

677
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:51,319
will we see to arbitrate those services

678
00:30:48,569 --> 00:30:51,319
at exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> points</font>

679
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:19,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name is mike use I'm the network</font>

681
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:26,560
me a bit a bit bit about myself oh sure

682
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,639
yeah hang on and a bit about himself for

683
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:33,909
first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I'm going to start with the</font>

684

cartoon so Paul said that he's digging

685
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:38,260
fiber all over the place and that's what

686
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,610
London looks like at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment and</font>

687
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:43,270
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Metromedia in the top right-hand</font>

688
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:45,990
corner so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay brand new answers on to</font>

network architecture over the links in

we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use the existing technologies</font>

we've already gotten and extend the life

flat ma'am it's a single layer to

should new technologies even replace it

that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> help avoiding having to do</font>

858
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,980
for the new stuff to come in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

859
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:25,400
alongside the old stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not replace</font>

860
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:27,140
it we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> off those bulk flows and talk</font>

861
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,550
them into the optical domain where the

862
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,020
optical domain is suited to actually

863
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:32,540
handle in that sort of level of<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

864
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:35,960
and these and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that base technology we</font>

00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:37,640
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can pick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that up using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wgm and</font>

866
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,350
then you can actually mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

867
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:43,210
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit your breakpoints in the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">internet technology is soon for example</font>

869
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,410
so one thing we sort of said here really

870
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,870
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody said this we like</font>

00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:54,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ethernet so it's definitely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still got a</font>

872
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:56,660
part to play I will echo when the

873
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:57,950
comment from from Paul if somebody wants

874
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make a switch that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really simple</font>

875
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:02,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">with just the code on that needs to do</font>

876
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:05,540
the job<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one so what so there is</font>

00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:09,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">an extra customer for that school it's</font>

879
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:13,640
flexible but it's also paradox because

880
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,100
the same things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that make it good are</font>

00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,330
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> its weaknesses at the moment we're</font>

00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,730
doing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> with ethernet that it was</font>

00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:25,760
same ethernet switch yeah it's becoming

886
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:29,810
a man of the campus technology and as

887
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,160
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a lamb technology so we need to</font>

888
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:34,730
probably improve the robustness and the

889
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:36,440
security in the lair to network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

890
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:41,750
you need to actually be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to restore</font>

891
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:43,490
and protect your network it brings<font color="#E5E5E5"> me on</font>

892
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:48,140
to the exchange points which<font color="#E5E5E5"> English</font>

893
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:50,629
wish list this started out as a topic at

894
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:52,670
the right Dax working group and it's

895
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:54,310
mainly come out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> extreme and foundry</font>

896
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:56,540
our vendors talking to us<font color="#CCCCCC"> and saying</font>

897
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:59,420
we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback from you guys about</font>

898
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:01,880
what you're looking for we've broken it

899
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,470
down into three broad sections it's not

900
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">if it's not published yet it's currently</font>

901
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,879

902
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,710
three broad sections as security and

903
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,390
access control so that's covering things

904
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:13,910
like security and management interfaces

905
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:17,299
like being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say only speak SNMP</font>

906
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:19,129
on this VLAN which is RFC 1918 and it

907
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:22,580
filters and it's only within my network

908
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:24,260
and automate the detection of the common

909
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:26,299
rule violations you seen let another

910
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:28,070
list of the common common things you

911
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,570
expect people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to switch off on exchanges</font>

912
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:32,500
you could even<font color="#E5E5E5"> employ</font>

913
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:35,060
automatically in the switch and again

914
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,710
Paul's wish of one mac address before

915
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:41,270
without having to do manual

916
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:43,100
configuration physical wishes things

917
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:44,870
like how quick the switch will<font color="#E5E5E5"> boot I</font>

918
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,970
know one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know if anybody's as</font>

919
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:48,049
software upgrades here those 60 seconds

920
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:49,569
waiting for something to boot back up

921
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:52,520
for the longest 60 seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your life</font>

922
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:55,340
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the questions in boots the better and</font>

923
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:56,810
then to the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> of physical wishes or</font>

924
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,580
things like proper hot swapping that you

925
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:00,710
can pull a management card and the box

926
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:03,110
will just fail over onto the other one

927
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,520
straight away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and until the second</font>

928
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,870
management car comes up<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will keep</font>

929
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,740
running in the direction that you left

930
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:11,600
it so mainly what we're doing is we're

931
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:15,500
seeking to improve on<font color="#E5E5E5"> extend life before</font>

00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:17,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ethernet in an exchange point the main</font>

934
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:21,560
and resilience so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when talking about</font>

935
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:24,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> STP optimizations and</font>

949
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,390
testing with our GMP we're running a

00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:10,460
separate multicast architecture we're

951
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,960
not running it over the main the

952
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,880
mainland and that's the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason we</font>

953
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,950
want to preserve<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stability of the</font>

00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,540
main of the main peering land that links

955
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,069
so we're actually running a separate

956
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,750

960
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,310
gmt see how it goes we're currently sort

961
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,540
of talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cisco and saying we'd like</font>

964
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,890

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment switches will never have</font>

layer ospf watching developments on

973
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,560
things like Brazilian packet rings again

00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,180
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> back into the multicast control</font>

975
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,160
what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> when people start using ipv6</font>

978
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:06,500

00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:11,750
developments on the tanger ye sides as

980
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:13,480
well a bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about our thoughts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

that layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to intelligent forwarding</font>

982
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:19,359
obviously you can't use a layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 in</font>

00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,589
anything that base to exchange point

00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:44,309
Angeles and Mae West which have been

1103

extensively<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad hoc bridge off of the</font>

1104
00:48:44,309 --> 00:48:52,650
main fabric and some people would say

1105
00:48:48,569 --> 00:48:56,690
that these have achieved a kind of

1106
00:48:52,650 --> 00:49:00,329
durability or robustness greater than

1107
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:02,539
and greater than that of any one

1108

between<font color="#E5E5E5"> those two models and why we</font>

allow ad hoc bridging off the fabric um

1119
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:42,119
I have never used this is the first time

thought ad hoc bridging led to

1122

robustness of any kind because<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

1123
00:49:46,529 --> 00:49:51,180
can tell you is that the lights go on

then the view at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power switch and</font>

1126
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:58,890
and so ad hoc pitching has been a source

essentially a series of I exes or mace

will give them greater stability from

00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:33,829
thinking about this in the context of

best to trench over there with dark

fiber and put a switch there and once

1163
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:47,598
the dark fiber is there I'm expecting

1164
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:50,480
the names will want to put a switch in

00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:04,069
two different subnets and it will always

1170
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:05,509
be possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know exactly what you are</font>

1171
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:07,549
plugged into and who you should be

1172
00:52:05,509 --> 00:52:10,339
talking to which used to be a bit of

1173
00:52:07,549 --> 00:52:12,859
guesswork when it was sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> done done</font>

1174
00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:14,930
the other way so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

1175
00:52:12,859 --> 00:52:16,670
understand the desire for organizational

1176
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:19,038
stability but you have to realize packs

1177
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:22,660
has been sold three times and no one has

1178
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,660
ever missed a packet because of it

1179
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:38,220
I really had no no particular object for

1180
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:43,120
this question probably Steve Feldman um

1181
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:45,609
two questions yeah am<font color="#CCCCCC"> i right to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kick</font>

1182
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:50,680
gigabit gigabit ethernet is faster than

00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:53,920
10 megabit Ethernet hundred times faster

1184
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:58,419
100 times faster then why<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we waiting</font>

1185
00:52:53,920 --> 00:53:02,050
why do we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that send gigas coming</font>

1186
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:04,420
down the horizon some 19 some<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors</font>

1187
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:06,460
have not quite shipping products but

1188
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,530
it's not not by standardized yet and

1189
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:11,260
nobody's building real standard hardware

1190
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:13,330
interfaces it's going to be 10 p exactly

1191
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:15,370
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really interesting for</font>

1192
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:16,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">variety of reasons one of which is also</font>

1193
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:19,600
that it happens to do the same speed as

1194
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:21,640
OC 192 which the 10 gigabit so at that

1195
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,230
point you don't have speed trade-offs

1196
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:26,970
when you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide what if it</font>

1197
00:53:23,230 --> 00:53:29,050
builds a path out of sonnet or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ethernet</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's other she's like I'm to you but</font>
