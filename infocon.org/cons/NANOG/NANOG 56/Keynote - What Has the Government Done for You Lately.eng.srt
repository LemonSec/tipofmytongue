that's what we see publicly but what we

don't realize is what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going on</font>

experience he's been to multiple Na

Nog's in his estimation eight to ten

23
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,869
he's very familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> with what who we are</font>

24
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,750
and what we do and so what he'd like to

25
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,520
do is tell us what has the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government</font>

Doug

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:43,090
thanks Dave<font color="#E5E5E5"> in asking people about what</font>

29
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,830
the government has done for you lately

30
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:50,500
it seems like the number one comment I

31
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:52,840
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> was what CBP and TSA for a pre-check</font>

32
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,610
and global entry and all that so

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,920
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you a different view</font>

34
00:01:54,610 --> 00:02:04,000
of what DHS and the government is doing

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:08,080
and I did on purpose create the title to

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,080
be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit catchy or controversial</font>

37
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,430
I know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are folks that have</font>

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,810
opinions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what the government</font>

39
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,750
should and shouldn't be doing with

40
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,690
respect to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet much more on the</font>

41
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:22,870
political side I do not intend to

42
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">discuss the political part of the</font>

43
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,350
government's involvement in the internet

44
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,060
I'm a technologist at heart and those of

45
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,040
you that are in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> audience that know</font>

46
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,250
me and that I've funded over the last 25

47
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,440
years know that to be true so I'll try

48
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">to stay out of the politics I'm actually</font>

49
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,650
more interested in one talking about

50
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have done but more importantly</font>

51
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,430
hearing from you what you think we

52
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't done to support the nanog</font>

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,700
technology creation and I'm actually

56
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,070
interested in having a discussion not

57
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:01,679
only today but as an ongoing<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion</font>

58
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:05,079
about what we can do to to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

59
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:10,030
in the operational community and in the

rd space<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did include also the notion</font>

61
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,470
of I think originally the title here was

62
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:18,700
what has your government done for you

63
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:22,750
lately this is not a us-centric intended

64
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:24,970
talk as you well know in within the

65
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,120
internet community it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> global issue</font>

66
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,780
and in particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security and</font>

67
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,650
within a Science and Technology

70
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,930

71
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:40,959
operational side is working with over 25

countries cert to cert and other types

73

of operations so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's intended not to be</font>

a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an eye chart but just</font>

77
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,660
want you to understand what the threat

78
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,080
is for the Department of Homeland

79
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,900
Security we are worried about<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

80
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:03,020
from globalization and transportation

81

84
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:16,760
natural disasters such as the Japanese

85
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,159
earthquake and tsunami as well as the

86
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,659
Deepwater Horizon all of those things

87
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,820
when you think of the Department of

88
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:28,790
Homeland Security it includes those

89
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:31,430
agencies FEMA TSA CBP ice and so we are

90
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:34,610
a very broad agency 230,000 people

91
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,660
strong which we see on a regular basis

some of them every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go through</font>

don't know the gentleman here in the

going on in the commercial marketplace

157
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,219
and what impacts<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're seeing with</font>

173
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:02,550
and technology is really four things one

174
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,640
is creating new technologies and what we

175
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:08,840
call knowledge products are our customer

176
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:13,650
set right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very focused on</font>

and defenses and explosives and those

180
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of four or five major focus</font>

181
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,110
areas the second thing is we work with

182
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,949
our operational folks so you're familiar

183
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:33,209
with CBP and TSA at the board at the

184
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:35,700
airport or at the borders they don't

185
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:37,919
have skills & expertise in acquisition

186
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,050
support or in operational analysis we

187
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,789
work to help them there we also try to

188
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,919
do process<font color="#E5E5E5"> improvements to help them</font>

190
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,910
doing better and cheaper using

191
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:51,089
technology and last but not least is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">be the front lines on threat and what's</font>

193
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:55,500
coming down the pipe we have a little

194
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:59,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit different model than anybody else in</font>

00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,500
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US government at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment my Dave</font>

said my experience is 25 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">government I've been at DHS 49 I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

198
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:10,170
DARPA 44 and I was at NSA for 12 and the

199
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,519
frustration at DARPA was creating

200
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,050
technology and throwing it over the

201
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,019
fence in the military never picking it

202
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,089
up so when I came to DHS we created a

203
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:21,390
model where we actively fund the back

204
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:23,310
end so we fund development testing and

205
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:26,310
evaluation in operational environments

206
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:28,529
and transition technologies into the

207
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,969
commercial marketplace and so it's a

208
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:31,500
it's a different market a different

209
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,690
model than anybody else in government

210
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,959
most other government agencies fund

211
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,000
basic research and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really fund the</font>

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,369
back end of making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we get this out</font>

213
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,779
and commercially available and so

214
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:49,260
because the the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the top right</font>

215
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:52,230
bubble is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most important one because</font>

216
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,209
nobody usually pays for that we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

217
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,100
familiar with the term valley of death I

00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:57,750
mean some of you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have experienced</font>

valley of death with startup companies

220
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:03,600
that never made it and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

221
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's a necessary</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part of a</font>

were the funding behind iron key back in

230
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,230
2005 that created a company that's now

00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:27,449
still going strong in the marketplace

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,110
had some problems with the anonymous

235
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,670
guys but in the end the technology was

236

really useful for the law<font color="#CCCCCC"> enforcement</font>

255
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,410
to initiate discussions with the Nano

leave 10 or 15 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> for for some</font>

272
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:05,540
administration and really talked about

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:10,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">we needed to fix DNS bgp and ipv6 and</font>

274

the why we jumped in<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had been funding</font>

275
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,920
dns and bgp related research when i was

276
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,330
at DARPA but the key phrase for us is

277
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,310
the government should play a role in the

278
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,480
private sector efforts<font color="#CCCCCC"> breakdown due to</font>

279
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:26,040
the need for coordination or lack of

00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:30,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">proper incentives in 2003 DNS SEC and</font>

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,080
at the time essentially was largely

283
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:37,290
complete and it was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> an uptake</font>

284
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,910
problem not an R&D problem and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,090

within the government to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a memo out</font>

of OMB saying that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US government</font>

validation so the key piece for DNS SEC

322
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,640
to actually work is validation and

323
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,280
within the US government standards

324
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,680

there other killer applications that

would help DNS SEC uptake of finance

sector related or postal system related

355
00:15:55,479 --> 00:16:01,689
or others now is the chance to let us

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're interested in in this</font>

let me move to the next one so for

better for worse some people like it

362
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:18,279
some people don't but we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:36,129
early 2000s that didn't do so well in

368

<font color="#CCCCCC">are folks in the room that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:45,720
helping us within the IETF for both

375
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:54,359
of course is sandy Murphy who's the

co-chair of the cider working group and

377
00:16:54,359 --> 00:17:00,549
so we've been behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the rfcs</font>

378
00:16:57,729 --> 00:17:04,480

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,289
are still some other documents that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

381
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:11,379
still to go but

382
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:15,319
really now focusing on operational

383
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:17,329
activities and trying to get operational

384
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:19,249
guidance and trust anchors of course

385
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:21,230
there's path validation which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also in</font>

00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:25,009
in process within the site or working

chart but the sum of the again our job

00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:34,369
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> smt and we do tool development and</font>

tool creation so while we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

working<font color="#E5E5E5"> closely with cisco and juniper</font>

392
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:42,679
to ensure commercial implementations are

underway we have been funding the to the

interoperable implementations to make

401
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:08,779

that when we started the DNS SEC

we're now what somebody told me today

to actually support not only the

451
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:19,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">helps our research and development guys</font>

00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,959
another stick in the in the carrot and

established a v6 testing program if

00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,190
you're doing v6 and you haven't talked

with with NIST it's been operational for

487
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,890
43 years and out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> available a little</font>

488
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an eye chart but just to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show you</font>

489
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:12,620
that in fact the US government has

490
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:15,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">started to deploy v6 as well as I think</font>

491
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,840
the bottom left one there is a DNS SEC

492
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:20,780
chart to show how much DNS sex been out

493
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:25,580
and available thirty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of public</font>

494
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:27,800
gov websites are ipv6 enabled that might

495
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,850
not be a lot for you but to get thirty

496
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,260
percent of the government to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

497
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:35,290
something sometimes is actually pretty

498
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:37,010
good let me move to my fourth topic

499
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,530
which has to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with internet</font>

500
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:41,900
measurement so you know of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course from</font>

501
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:44,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the government side you know the</font>

502
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:47,090
internet finally is considered critical

503
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:49,010
infrastructure and part of the issue of

504
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">understanding the internet is an ability</font>

505
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to measure it and model what's going on</font>

506
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,000
so we have been actively funding the

507
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:58,910
development of tools and techniques<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

508
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,280
mapping cyberspace in various ways

shapes and forms<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going to talk</font>

510
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,850
about one of them that you're probably

511
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:09,139
most familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> which has to do with</font>

512
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:11,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the k'da works but we are concerned from</font>

513
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,580
a government standpoint in understanding

514
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:17,420
what's going on I think some of the you

515
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,980
know some of the best papers those

516
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,980
papers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came out in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last couple</font>

517
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:25,960
of years based on the what happened on

518
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:29,450
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet when the with the japan</font>

519
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,970
Tsunami etc what happened in various

520
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:34,520
countries in the Arab Spring really

521
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:37,220
helped<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision-makers and policy makers</font>

522
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:40,040
within Washington start to understand

523
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,690
how important it is that we on that we

524
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,090
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and understand what's going on on</font>

525
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:47,360
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course you know nowadays</font>

526
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:49,340
twitter is the is the fastest way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

527
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,120
find out things<font color="#CCCCCC"> but there's still the</font>

528
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,918
longer term

529
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,899
management and<font color="#E5E5E5"> modeling of measurement</font>

530
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:57,000
infrastructure if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar</font>

531
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:59,189
with something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called arc or archipelago</font>

532
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,409
this is the measurement platform that we

533
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:06,840
have funded with kada the<font color="#E5E5E5"> we the</font>

534
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:11,309
software is available you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have data and</font>

535
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:13,830
access I think it's 60 sites that we've

536
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:17,639
actually funded deployment of

537
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:20,010
infrastructure a lot of that is we buy

538
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:22,580
the box and somebody here in this room

539
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:26,039
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably hosting that box for kada</font>

540
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:28,139
but again this helps the research

541
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:31,200
community I believe it also helps those

542
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:33,000
of you in operations other things you're

543
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to hear a talk later today from I</font>

544
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,880
think Matthew lucky on the AAS level a s

545
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:41,100
rank activities that we have funded and

546
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,720
certainly visualization is part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

547
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,399
but again internet measurement and

548
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:49,409
understanding what's going on is

549
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:53,489
critical for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government and as we go</font>

550
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:55,320
forward the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> program is again</font>

551
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,929
another controversial one is has to do

552
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:03,178
with open source I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> huge open source</font>

553
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:05,730

554
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:08,039
program at DARPA that improved the

555
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:11,490
security of linux freebsd and openbsd

556

<font color="#CCCCCC">open-source crypto it's a little bit</font>

573
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:50,519
difficult we ended up paying about four

574
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:54,659
hundred thousand dollars to ensure that

575

created the license for the suricata

where several of these companies to one

648
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,030
that's a little bit sticky we've had

649
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,440
lawyers involved from day one but

650
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:05,370
typical researchers can't get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

651
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,040
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I've talked to many of you that</font>

652
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:10,020
run commercial operations and it's

653
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,330
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for you as well because you</font>

654
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,830
have to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> ndas with the researchers and</font>

655
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,320
they have to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> and live with you for</font>

656
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:19,530
a while and you won't let<font color="#E5E5E5"> them take the</font>

657
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:23,370
data out and and so what we've set up

658
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:25,889
with predict is an operation<font color="#CCCCCC"> where it's</font>

659
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:27,600
freely available legally collected

660
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,550
because we have to live with the

661
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,309
Electronic Communications Privacy Act

662
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:34,620
for the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's a large</font>

00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:38,250
repository of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we make</font>

664
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:40,949
available on a global basis so far we

665
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:43,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">have one country where we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">partnership signed agreements with Japan</font>

667
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:47,700
and Japan researchers are now getting

668
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:50,070
access to predict data we're in process

669
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:54,120
with Canada having conversations with

670
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:57,300
Australia and the Dutch as well but the

671
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:59,790
key here is access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to data that</font>

672
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,350
researchers might not otherwise have a

<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of a process chart on the</font>

one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them those of you that know</font>

676
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:10,800
manish manish is no longer at to merit

677
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,600
for the time being<font color="#CCCCCC"> manish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a DHS S&T</font>

00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,820

679
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">running the predict program so certainly</font>

680
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:20,129
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to grab manish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk to</font>

00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:23,100
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that again probably the</font>

682
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:25,250
important bullet here is the second one

683
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:28,500
about tools and techniques for<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyzing</font>

684
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:30,419
internet data sets again interested in

685
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,590
creating better tools and the

686
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:34,619
autumn owners just<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

687
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:36,389
indication of the types of data that

688
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:40,230
we're gathering and making available

689
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:42,959
it's largely non-controversial even

690
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:44,549
though we've had lawyers involved we

691
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,559
realize we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to step into some more</font>

692
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:49,739
controversial data sets and that's going

693
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:53,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Manisha's job welcome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on board</font>

694
00:30:49,739 --> 00:30:57,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">Manish so the last one is legal and</font>

695
00:30:53,279 --> 00:31:00,239
ethical so there's been in the last

696
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:01,859
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years 250 papers 350 terabytes of</font>

697
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:04,070
data for some of you that's not very big

698
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:06,619
for the research community that's a lot

699
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,580
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see some of the research groups</font>

700
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:11,100
again we're opening it up

701
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,689
internationally in a

702
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:15,959
government-to-government fashion to have

703
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:18,840
our foreign governments be able to

704
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,759
verify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the researchers and validate the</font>

705
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,439
receipt researchers the other thing that

706
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:23,609
predict is done which i think is if

707
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,259
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not familiar with encourage you</font>

708
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:27,809
to look at is something called the<font color="#CCCCCC"> menlo</font>

709
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:30,539
report this was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attempt at</font>

710
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:32,609
documenting some of the ethical issues

711
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:34,980
in information communication technology

712
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:37,199
research we have researchers out there

713
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,919
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> over botnets and you have to ask</font>

714
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,950
yourself the question is that legal is

715
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:46,769
that ethical and we still have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

716
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in that the community doesn't have</font>

717
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:50,879
agreement on what is and isn't legal and

718
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:53,779
ethical so we've done the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first version</font>

719
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:56,428

720
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:59,340
google and find it but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

721
00:31:56,429 --> 00:32:00,779
working with universities and other

722
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,480
government agencies and some of the

723
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:08,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">societies like a cm and I Triple E to</font>

724
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:10,139
try to strengthen the policies before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

725
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,999
end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with more help than we need from</font>

726
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:14,758
people like Capitol Hill who want to

727
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:16,139
mandate or other types of things so it's

728
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:17,909
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> better if you get your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> house</font>

729
00:32:16,139 --> 00:32:22,830
in order then have somebody else try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

730
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:24,600
help you one other area that we've are

731
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:28,320
actively<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in is what we call</font>

732
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:31,379
cybersecurity competitions so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

733
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,928
not not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best crowd but if you're I</font>

734
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:37,759
hate to do an age discrimination but if

735
00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:37,759
you're under 30 can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you stand up</font>

736
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:51,240
so 1 2 3 4<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 7 8 9 10 11 20 30 50</font>

737
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:52,650
maybe 20 and what we have 580 right just

738
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,130
a real quick calculation that's like

739
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:57,480
three percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what I'll tell you</font>

740
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:58,530
is that's exactly that's actually a

741
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,960
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than I normally find</font>

742
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:02,428
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually especially in a crowd in</font>

743
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,220
Washington of a hundred people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have</font>

744
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:06,690
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> person under 30 right the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest</font>

745
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:09,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem we have is the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> generation</font>

746
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:12,720
and so what we're finding is it's

747
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:14,640
important for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fund things to get</font>

748
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,059
high school and college kids interested

749
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,340
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity as a job not just as a</font>

750
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:23,340
hobby so we fund the National Collegiate

751
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:26,520
cyber defense competition<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2,500 students</font>

752
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:29,159
this past year across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the country the</font>

00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,260
winning<font color="#CCCCCC"> university at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the competition</font>

00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">was University of Washington you how</font>

755
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:39,419
many Washington Huskies here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great</font>

756
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:40,530
not nice job there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called</font>

757
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:44,040
the national initiative for

<font color="#E5E5E5">cybersecurity education or nice it's a</font>

760
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:50,879
Washington aimed at awareness and formal

761
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:53,429
education and work force etc encourage

762
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,990
you to look at it but more importantly

763
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:56,630
encourage you to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font>

764
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:59,250
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some of these competitions</font>

765
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:02,160
why well because they need help they

766
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:04,500
need new technologies to bring in so

767
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,900
this past year excuse me this<font color="#E5E5E5"> next year</font>

768
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,820
we are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> bringing in DNS SEC as</font>

769
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,980
part of the competition so the college

770
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">kids are going to have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learn how DNS</font>

771
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:16,770
SEC works and to be able to deploy it

772
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:19,529
and defend it or use it but we're trying

773
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:22,649
to insert new technologies this is a

774
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:25,440
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> way for you to find new employees</font>

775
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:27,569
if you're looking for some they'll work

776
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,750
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheaply as soon as undergrads and</font>

777
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:32,580
grad students and if you're a Red Team

778
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:34,469
ER and like to do the hacking stuff we

779
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:36,239
we actually are always looking for red

780
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:38,459
teamers there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 regional</font>

781
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,770
tournaments around the country we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

782
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,149
taking our competitions to Australia

783
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:43,889
will be helping Australia run their

784
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:46,859
first national collegiate competition

785
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:51,240
next year but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would encourage</font>

786
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:53,310
you to consider that just a history of

787
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:54,689
some national cybersecurity documents if

788
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,219
you haven't seen them that

789
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:59,430
to most relevant on the research side

790
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:01,649
are the first one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the road map</font>

791
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,660
it looks like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's available at the</font>

792
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:06,599
website it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a hundred page</font>

793
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:08,190
document that outlines topic areas we're

794
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:09,560
interested in and research and believe

795
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:13,460
there's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> research to be had</font>

796
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:17,160
everything from metrics to malware to

797
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:20,550
usability and the other one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a federal</font>

798
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:23,819
R&D plan that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just published last</font>

799
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:25,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">December it outlines from an interagency</font>

800
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:27,660
perspective across all of government

801
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:29,490
what the agencies are spending their

802
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,890
money on over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next three to five</font>

803
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:33,140
years so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a researcher and even</font>

804
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:35,848
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not and you're interested</font>

805
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:37,140
encourage you to take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look my personal</font>

806
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:39,060
favorite of course and the one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

807
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">developed is the one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called transition</font>

808
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:44,190
to practice we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have hundreds of millions</font>

809
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,170
of dollars of government-funded research

810
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:49,079
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the shelf collecting dust</font>

811
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:53,940
let's go find the gold nuggets and turn

812
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:57,089
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> into commercial products the last</font>

813
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,710
one is you I'm sure you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask</font>

814
00:35:57,089 --> 00:36:01,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question great how can we work with</font>

815
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:03,960
you Doug well certainly email<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things</font>

816
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:05,279
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if you end up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing you</font>

827
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,650
will review your five page white paper

828
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:34,348
if we're interested we'll ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a full</font>

you it could be anywhere between you

832
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:47,040
the idea and that process can take

833
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,520
anywhere between about three to nine

834
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,930
months but you can see the topic areas

835
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,349
they're all topic areas I've already

836
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:56,879
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> host in the open source</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff we do forensics for the law</font>

838
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,670
enforcement we're doing competitions

839
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:04,050
we're doing cloud<font color="#CCCCCC"> and mobile and and</font>

840
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:06,210
experiments we're always looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

841
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:07,890
people and that are doing experiments

842
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,610
with technology and willing to be guinea

pig

844
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:14,040
posters last we believe that

845
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity is a key area for</font>

846

innovation for the country and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

847
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,490
for the for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the foreseeable future we</font>

848
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,730
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a fairly aggressive</font>

849
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:25,020
program within DHS actively involved on

850
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:27,480
the international front and on the

851
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:30,660
interagency front<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with people</font>

852
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:34,590
like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> on key topics DNS security</font>

853
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:37,890
routing security etc all focused on tech

transition and experimental deployment

855
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:45,180
so I'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> largely to shoot a shot over</font>

what more we can do to help and with

00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,700
that save myself about nine minutes for

860
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,700

things that you guys have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done lately</font>

865
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,720

866
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,460
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government didn't really help</font>

back<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 years it started the internet so</font>

869
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:25,190
things are good you mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

870
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,870
like DNS SEC and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know bgb securing</font>

871
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:28,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP and things like that the biggest</font>

872
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:30,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem that one of the biggest problems</font>

873
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I many people on the internet have</font>

00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,150
right now is booth source bcp 38 it's

875
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,490
been out for quite a while the

876
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:39,170
government has a pretty big hammer to

877
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:41,359
swing you could do things like if you

878
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:44,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't support bc t-38 we will not buy</font>

transit from you or Colo or whatever you

880
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:49,910
know any IT infrastructure since you

881
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:52,070
spend a metric ton of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

882
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,600
encourage people you know but with their

883
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:55,580
wallets<font color="#CCCCCC"> too is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a new measurement</font>

884
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,040
diet no no that's an old measurement ok

885
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,750
that's it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been around for a while</font>

886
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:05,750
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I translated into metric for our</font>

887
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:08,060
Canadian friends so<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh I just I thought</font>

888
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe if the government you know put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

889
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,029
something in 12 months we will cancel

890
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:12,650
any contract with any network or

891
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:15,170
provider that does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not support bc b 38</font>

892
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:17,090
life would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be much much much better for</font>

893
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:18,350
me and many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room is that</font>

894
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:20,210
something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would consider or</font>

895
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:22,310
something else you could do to<font color="#CCCCCC"> encourage</font>

896
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,050
this good question Doug what<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you know</font>

897
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:29,960
about your conversation with OMB is bc

898
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:31,640
p38 on the table I don't know which ones

899
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,800
Doug<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he's standing up over there oh</font>

900
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:39,879
he's going to my coat this way Doug Doug

901
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">hey thank you</font>

902
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:51,140
I don't know that that issue has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

903
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:52,400
specifically addressed it like the OMB

904
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,680
level although and certainly on the

905
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:59,270
radar screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly we have plans to</font>

906
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:00,830
use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of usual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> missed pipeline to</font>

907
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:03,050
put pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that issue which is</font>

908
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:05,210
typically back to the FISMA the chain

909
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:07,010
and that sort of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do think it's a</font>

910
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:09,290
topic that should receive even more

911
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:12,350
focus than the normal pipeline that we

912
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:13,520
can put pressure on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the topic ok well</font>

913
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:15,890
there's anything we can do to encourage

914
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:20,020
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to smack people who don't support it</font>

915
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:25,310
let us know thanks preciate that pecker

916

both juniper and cisco now have<font color="#E5E5E5"> shipping</font>

code for our PKA I origin validation so

that's moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know in our</font>

944
00:41:53,249 --> 00:41:59,459
discussions with nist as we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

DNS SEC the intent is through the

government<font color="#CCCCCC"> requirements process we will</font>

00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:07,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">in fact require government agencies to</font>

deploy our pki and to deploy bgp sick as

949
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:14,609
those to roll out unfortunately our

950
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:18,569
process takes every couple of years but

951
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:19,828
very similar to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp 38 i mean i</font>

952
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:21,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">think those are certainly the types of</font>

953
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:24,449
things we intend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put into the</font>

954
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:27,059
standards process especially given<font color="#CCCCCC"> aaron</font>

955
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:30,390
and and the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rollout of our PK across</font>

956
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:32,309
the five registries thank you good

957
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:34,859
question i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was next I</font>

958
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:36,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">think maybe here in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle my name</font>

959
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:38,249
is Eric hosting with network utility

960
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:40,440
force I was curious what your

961
00:42:38,249 --> 00:42:42,598
Department's involvement is with the

962
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:46,829
evaluation approval and perhaps d

963
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:49,589
barring of not foreign-owned software

964
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:52,799
and hardware providers in critical

965
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:55,949
infrastructure projects so we're at the

966
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:58,380
table but we're not the final say most

967
00:42:55,949 --> 00:43:01,289
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gets either through State</font>

968
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:03,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">Department or commerce but but we are</font>

969
00:43:01,289 --> 00:43:05,190
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the agencies at the table that</font>

970
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:06,749
gets invited to look at the technology

971
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,250
to have the discussion about<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it</font>

972
00:43:06,749 --> 00:43:12,939
should or should not be allowed

973
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:14,410
in but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's not our process</font>

974
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:19,060
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> State</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Department and commerce</font>

how does is there any process by which

981
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:34,090
the Nano community can help assess those

990
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:54,900
certainly believe we could as long as

00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:58,480
you guys are willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be guinea pigs</font>

your test and evaluation environments to

1000
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">back and think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about and figure out what</font>

1001
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:23,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">that process might be great thanks thank</font>

1002
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:26,190
you come on government guy target on<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

1004
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:34,069
if I'm your friend there we go there we

1006
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:38,808
much to gain I have a morbid question I

1007
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,759
figure I'll put it to you while you're

1008
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:42,769
here since the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> can afford</font>

1009
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:45,619
nipper net<font color="#CCCCCC"> supernet and others we've</font>

1010
00:44:42,769 --> 00:44:47,839
never heard of why the interest<font color="#CCCCCC"> it seems</font>

1011
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:51,019
altruistic at first but why the interest

1012
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:52,999
in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> network thanks for making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it an</font>

1013
00:44:51,019 --> 00:44:54,618
all but I mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems to work pretty</font>

1014
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:56,149
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people and</font>

1015
00:44:54,619 --> 00:44:57,799
probably private<font color="#E5E5E5"> industries that do</font>

1016
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:59,390
pretty good watchdog<font color="#CCCCCC"> porn on and so</font>

1017
00:44:57,799 --> 00:45:02,210
forth i'm just generally curious what's

1018
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:04,879
the vested interest of sure sure no

1019
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:06,619
problem um so it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> runs on the same</font>

1020
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,869
net right even sipper and nipper and

1021
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:10,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">things are purely just tunnel over right</font>

1022
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:14,509
but you have to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the difference</font>

1023
00:45:10,369 --> 00:45:16,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">between DoD and DHS so DoD has the</font>

1024
00:45:14,509 --> 00:45:19,309
responsibility for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> military side of</font>

1025
00:45:16,549 --> 00:45:22,009
the world and are much more focused on

1026
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:23,960
the classified side DHS has the

1027
00:45:22,009 --> 00:45:27,170
responsibility for the homeland<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1028
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:29,210
homeland includes private sector calm

1029
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:32,569
etc which of course leads us to the

1030
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:34,249
infamous phrase of you know 85 to 90

1031
00:45:32,569 --> 00:45:36,650
percent of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is run by the</font>

1032
00:45:34,249 --> 00:45:39,738
<font color="#CCCCCC">private sector that still doesn't and</font>

1033
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:41,839
that's still we know you run it but we

1034
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:46,339
DHS actually have the government

1035
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:49,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">quote-unquote responsibility for making</font>

1036
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:51,430
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that resources available to</font>

1037
00:45:49,339 --> 00:45:56,150
the government in times of need as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

1038
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:58,339
where the DoD doesn't right i mean

1039
00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:00,499
they've it kind of had<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in the past</font>

1040
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:03,019
but since DHS was created and there's

1041
00:46:00,499 --> 00:46:05,029
been a bit of a food fight in<font color="#E5E5E5"> washington</font>

1042
00:46:03,019 --> 00:46:08,419
between DHS and DOD but over the last

1043
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:10,970
couple of years DoD is largely said not

1044
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:13,460
our responsibility DHS you have that

1045
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:15,649
responsibility and they follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font>

1046
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:18,259
that would be maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a blessing</font>

1047
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:21,319
in a way if if you guys could help

1048
00:46:18,259 --> 00:46:24,259
commit to some anti itu interests maybe

1049
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:28,220
this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a good trade we are as you</font>

1050
00:46:24,259 --> 00:46:30,289
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> well imagine there have been no end</font>

1051
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:33,169
of no shortage of meetings over the last

1052
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:35,989
six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months across the federal government</font>

1053
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:38,150
in trying to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> prepared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for wicked and</font>

1054
00:46:35,989 --> 00:46:39,340
other types of government internet

1055
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:41,080
governance types of

1056
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:46,090
beings<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to occur over the</font>

1057
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:47,740
next several months and yes there has

1058
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:49,990
been a fairly significant wake up in

1059
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:52,060
Washington in the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> little while I'm</font>

1069
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,160

the government to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it forward</font>

1094
