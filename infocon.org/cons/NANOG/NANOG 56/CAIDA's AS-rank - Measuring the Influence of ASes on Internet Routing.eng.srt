1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,650
okay next up we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matthew lucky from</font>

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:29,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">kada hi this is what I've done well what</font>

3
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,120
has been going on for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> round about</font>

4
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,280
eight or ten years<font color="#CCCCCC"> now educator and what</font>

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,599
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about has been going on the</font>

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,309
work that I've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the past sort</font>

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:49,920
of year this work that I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

8
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:53,069
bread and<font color="#CCCCCC"> mogan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Casey okay no okay so</font>

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,520
what this talk is is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a project</font>

10
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,410
called is Frank which is available on

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,350
the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> or no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> results</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through I've</font>

12
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,289
everyone into<font color="#CCCCCC"> ice rink catered at all</font>

13
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:07,530
and what this project is is at first we

14
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,420
infer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is relationships going down the</font>

15
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,979
same road that number of other

16
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,990
researchers have gone down over the

17
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,299
years of using<font color="#E5E5E5"> publicly available bgp</font>

18
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,408
paths so what we what we do is we

19
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:22,619
download rubs from reviews and resin

20
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,060
there's approximately 400 aess providing

21
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,500
views to wrap use and<font color="#CCCCCC"> resin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,860
theater than were providing full views

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,979
and with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> is relationship inferences</font>

24
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,799
we make custom provider peer-to-peer we

25
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,020
then try and fear the influence of

26
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,600
individual is is based on the size of

27
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,399
their customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> comb and the way to think</font>

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,908
about the customer cone as an operator

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,090
is that a traffic that arise from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

30
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,850
customer and then is transmitted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our</font>

31
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,530
customer so essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fraction of</font>

32
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,479
traffic that makes you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most money</font>

33
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:59,549
because you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid twice for it on</font>

34
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,740
net traffic so an overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk</font>

35
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,950
I'm briefly going to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

36
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,658
objectives of of the work and then most

37
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a methodology about how</font>

38
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,489
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go about it in order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to gauge</font>

39
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,980
feedback for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the validity of</font>

40
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,420
our assumptions so

41
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,518
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to spend a lot of time</font>

42
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,440
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the assumptions about how</font>

43
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:23,220
they algorithm works and then illustrate

44
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,049
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm with a sample path and I'm</font>

45
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,480
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you some results and grass</font>

46
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:31,650
and I've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sway at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the end about</font>

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,840
how you can help so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can all</font>

48
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,379
agree that<font color="#E5E5E5"> s relationships determine how</font>

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,610
traffic flows through the internet and

50
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:41,569
having a set of accurate is

51
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:44,400
relationships enables us what supports

52
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:45,899
some measurement of of the

53
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,799
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> security and stability</font>

54
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,629
what happens f say one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the larger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AES</font>

55
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:54,150
is with a large customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> cone is</font>

56
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,858
disrupted what is going to happen in the

57
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet in terms of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reckon versions how</font>

58
00:02:55,859 --> 00:03:01,620
many parts are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be disrupted so</font>

59
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,510
on analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Miss collegiate we miss</font>

60
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,390
configuration for example that helps to

61
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,590
download case where if we're dodo starts

62
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,149
announced with provider routes to

63
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,069
another provider we shouldn't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

64
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,870
in the internet so having a set of

65
00:03:11,069 --> 00:03:17,670
accurate relationships might enable us

66
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:20,730
to detect this automatically and what

67
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,518
we're using it for is an analysis of the

68
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,918
influence of a s is based on the size of

69
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">the customer comb and again that's</font>

70
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,599
roughly what is the absolute number of a

71
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:37,079
s is that a provider could charge

72
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:39,988
traffic for so and this talk we focus on

73
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:42,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">28 relationships these are the canonical</font>

74
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:47,400
ones that I've always hold but they come

75
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:50,010
pretty close customer provider where the

76
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,049
customer pays a provider to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

77
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:56,790
to its providers appears and customers

78
00:03:52,049 --> 00:04:00,500
and peers where the agreed to

79
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,500
exchange traffic between their customers

80
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:05,459
with these set of relationships we

81
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,190
assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cash flow follows from</font>

82
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,139
the customer to the provider and terms

83
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,940
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP relationships we can't tell if</font>

84
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,609
peers the settlement free or paid

85
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:18,539
peering I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have feedback on</font>

86
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:19,769
that was the end but essentially money

87
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:25,340
is flowing from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer to the</font>

88
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:25,340
provider so the customer cone is

89
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">governor governor set of</font>

90
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:35,560
chips for a ace customers direct

91
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:38,319
customers are<font color="#CCCCCC"> BNC but I provided that</font>

92
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,050
traffic reaches it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> C will receive</font>

93
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:44,289
settlement not from<font color="#CCCCCC"> D but will be paid</font>

94
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,449
to transit traffic from for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font>

95
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:50,650
if assuming it doesn't go across the

96
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:55,599
peering link so ace customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> cone</font>

97
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:58,539
contains B C D and E and F but not G

98
00:04:55,599 --> 00:05:01,389
which is across appearing link so the

99
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:07,750
customer code contains customers as well

100
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:09,880
as indirect customers so we have a set

101
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,199
of btb powers on the left and a set of

102
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationships we've and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> food</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

103
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,440
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to present three</font>

104
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,870
different ways of constructing a

105
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,000
customer cone and solicit your feedback

106
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,009
on on each of them the first one is

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,580
what's called<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recursive customer comb</font>

108
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:28,120
so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we infer a to be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> customer</font>

109
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:31,060
of be it might be natural to infer that

110
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,750
a as an indirect customer of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> except</font>

111
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:38,050
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp pads don't suggest that that is</font>

112
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,550
that be so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a has a path to be</font>

113
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,909
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we never see one so the</font>

114
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,740
recursive cone contains all of the aces

115
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:48,909
in the graph five of them but if we look

116
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:53,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">at what is observed in b2b pads we don't</font>

117
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:55,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">see a path from E to a so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> follows</font>

118
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,880
custom provider relations are links so

119
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:03,659
we infer that<font color="#CCCCCC"> its customer cone sizes</font>

120
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,199
for and does not contain<font color="#CCCCCC"> E but the</font>

121
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:08,259
computation is a little bit more

122
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,500
complicated than that so a SS may have

123
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:12,940
and a piece of feedback we've had

124
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,590
repeatedly is that asus may have a

125
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:20,560
customer provider relationship in one

126
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:22,210
region but be peering elsewhere but when

127
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,940
we assign relationships we choose a

128
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,340
single relationship between two aces so

129
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,800
when we infer a customer by relationship

130
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that overrides everything on the graph</font>

131
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,210
so even if appearing nearly nearly

132
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:37,210
everywhere else we infer a single

133
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,580
relationship customer to provider but

134
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,729
using observed<font color="#CCCCCC"> BBB+ limits the amount of</font>

135
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:45,919
damage that can occur

136
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:47,479
so in this example we have x and y with

137
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,639
region based relationships customer

138
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:54,830
provider and type C and B have region

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:26,779
contain from see DNA<font color="#E5E5E5"> because those are</font>

149
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:31,939
what we observe to see followed on a

150
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:34,099
series of customer provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> links so our</font>

151
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:37,460
third approach to defining customer cone

152
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:40,248
might be to define<font color="#E5E5E5"> it based on what we</font>

153
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:43,460
see announced to an peers and

154
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:46,939
providers what we believe what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate</font>

155
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:52,128
certainly to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customers the actual</font>

156
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:56,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers so in this case because we see</font>

157
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:59,719
a path to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a from B that contains D and E</font>

158
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:03,560
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not if G and H then we will infer</font>

159
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:11,959
B's customer comb to contain just D and

160
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:13,749
E and C so with those with the customer

161
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,830
code in mind there's a bunch of caveats

162
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:18,589
again I've talked about region based

163
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:20,568
relationships and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't be on that we</font>

164
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:22,999
can't differentiate between paid peers

165
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:25,129
and settlement free peers so a paid<font color="#CCCCCC"> pier</font>

166
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:27,050
we do not include in the customer kind

167
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,449
of an AS even though they are paying

168
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:34,459
settlements to their peer even though

169
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:35,930
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the aces paying settlements but</font>

170
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,978
<font color="#E5E5E5">the PB that we've had in discussions</font>

171
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:40,159
with operators is that there's no

172
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:42,169
routing difference that a paid<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer is</font>

173
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,380
treated identically to a settlement free

174
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:48,740
pier we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about traffic so if</font>

175
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,630
you're a large access provider and you

176
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,170
have tens of millions of residential

177
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,459
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

178
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,870
customer code is going to be small

179
00:08:53,459 --> 00:09:00,449
because your customer code is countered

180
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:01,620
by iess so we don't hear traffic we

181
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of visibility and</font>

187

market power we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a lot more data</font>

198
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:46,138
maybe to keep you interested i'm going

199
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:50,639
to present a few graphs so this graph is

200
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:56,550
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> observed customer cone time series</font>

00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:10,079

graph a number of cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have</font>

global crossing so those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

212
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:34,459
observed pars and this doesn't cleanly

213
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:36,689
deal with region based relationships

214
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:38,939
particularly you might notice that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

215
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:42,440
are spikes in the graph that aren't well

216
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:48,630
explainable that these could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be due to a</font>

217
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:50,940
single relationship being<font color="#CCCCCC"> Miss and third</font>

218
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,180
or it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have we</font>

219
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:58,380
have visibility sometimes but not others

220
00:10:53,180 --> 00:11:01,949
but perhaps that could also be due to us

221
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:04,939
seeing periodically evidence of region

222
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:07,280
based relationships

223
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:10,100
so this graph is the customer code<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

224
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,160
defined by an providers and peers

225
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:18,140
so this cone is likely to underestimate

226
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:20,959
the size of ivan is because we are

227
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,120
presumably missing some customers and

228
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:27,920
pick me know we're missing customers but

229
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:30,710
as treats all ace's equally in fact if

230
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,050
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide a view to route views then</font>

the provider and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pierre cone that view</font>

234
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,040
itself does not influence the size of

235
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,080
the customer cone but what matters is

236
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:50,180
what your peers and providers relate to

237
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:53,180
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll relay publicly so in this level</font>

238

<font color="#E5E5E5">that in absolute terms and two in late</font>

240
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,690
two thousand twelve is forty percent

241
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,360
four percent of the internet and the

<font color="#CCCCCC">observed cone the previous graph that's</font>

243
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:09,400
fifty nine percent so that's customer

244
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,690
cone I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the</font>

245
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,390
relationship algorithms that we the

246
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,920
algorithm that we developed we went back

247
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the drawing board with this because</font>

248
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,319
and the ground truth that we'd collected

249
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,569
over a number of years our relationship

250
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">the algorithm we that we provided that</font>

251
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,230
are publicly for and a number of other

252
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,630
ones did not match the ground truth very

253
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:33,170
well so with that in mind we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to</font>

254
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:36,260
develop a new one so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to begin</font>

255
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:40,339
with a few definitions a transit<font color="#CCCCCC"> degree</font>

256
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:42,710
so we use the governor set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP powers</font>

257
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,840
and a SS transit<font color="#E5E5E5"> degree there's a number</font>

258
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:48,170
of a SS for which it provides transit

259
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,790
for and we can't tell if the ISS but

260
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,260
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are providing that they are</font>

261
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,780
transmitting traffic between<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

262
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:55,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">providers customers or peers but what it</font>

263
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:59,120
allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to do is to differentiate</font>

264
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:04,030
between large transit a<font color="#E5E5E5"> SS and large</font>

265
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:07,700
edge<font color="#E5E5E5"> I users that might peer extensively</font>

266
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:10,640
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a node degree so</font>

267
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:13,400
and B's case B's transfer degree is for

268
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:18,199
because it provides transit between<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:27,110
of using<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp paths we have an assumption</font>

272
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:29,899
that there is a collective asses at the

274
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:33,350
these as tier 1 a SS but these include

275
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,740
more than just the t1i uses these

276
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:39,740
include other transit providers that are

in a previous step that AT&T and level 3

are members of the cloak and have a

375
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:05,880
sorry then we break up the path into

376
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:08,880
triplets and then we label each node

377

with its transit degree what we observed

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,929
to be its treasure degree so a in terms

them an<font color="#E5E5E5"> order of transit degree so we</font>

384
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:33,360
visit a first now it might be natural to

00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:36,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">interfere that a is a customer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of AT&T</font>

in this case because<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is appearing</font>

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,700
don't make an inference based on this

389
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:45,928
information unless we can this we have

390

other things pointing us in that

00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:57,120
that AT&T is leaking routes p routes to

from a two other pairs and customers

398
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:19,049
that's right other peers and customers

399
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,389
and the net decision to do so has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

400
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:23,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">validated multiple times and if we don't</font>

enforce this rule than our validation

402
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:27,990
results go down so that's essentially

403
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,659
why we do it we inferred thee as a

408
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:41,009
appears now than we would have inferred

409
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,539
a customer relationship but and thus we

410
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:44,340
don't and we still might be inferring

411
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:48,690
leap blinking but we can't do much about

412
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:53,610
that when for cust see is a customer of

413
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:55,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">B because we see see the CB announced to</font>

its provider routes from

415
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:03,429
see so and we proceed so we had seven

00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,860
have no providers because otherwise we

435
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,449
would infer no customers for them and a

436
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,540
good example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that is transit rail and</font>

437
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:58,000
finally when all else fails then we are

438
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,800
left with triplets where we have

439
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,200
inferred no relationship and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we infer</font>

no relationship then we will fear both

00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,360
links to be peers and this may or may

442
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:09,790
not be case the case so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we try and</font>

leave everything else so there's some

accurate and fearing both provider

<font color="#E5E5E5">our previous algorithm may include many</font>

more providers they need then in reality

501
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:50,020
so they have a very small set of peer to

502

503

what we'd like help for from men are

and what's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our assumptions is</font>

562
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:44,610
that a customer is announced to a

provider's providers and what situations

something about how prevalent complex

does your study relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

difference that we see in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> use of a</font>

esas across the world it treats them all

00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:37,550
as equals and that's a limitation again

don't know as a simple observation

604
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:58,940
somewhere in that massive ranking of

605
00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:01,939
huge providers you would expect to see

606
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like China Telecom but they're</font>

607
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:08,480
phenomenally notable by their very

absence in any such ranking and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it kind</font>

609
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,480
of wonder how<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would integrate</font>

610
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:19,940
different regions uses of a esas into

611
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:22,730
this I guess we would need additional

612
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:27,280
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some way to express that</font>

613
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:27,280
as a rule so we need more ground truth I

better go<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my can you go to the</font>

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero to all of the above so if you limit</font>

yourself to a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> smaller set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than the</font>

624
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:00,450
questions become nearly one hundred

625
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:01,920
percent the complex relationships have

626
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:03,450
even the people the networks that you

627
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,120
had in that slide the very large

628
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,770
providers are massively complex I mean

629
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at just what level three announces</font>

630
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:12,120
through press releases in the fact that

631
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:14,189
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know cogent sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Comcast got them</font>

632
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:17,219
to somebody here works for coaching is

633
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,420
going to piss to me now so the fact that

634
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,980
level three puts out a press release

635
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,390
saying that Comcast force them into

636
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,100
peering as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a transit</font>

637
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:24,870
relationship and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

638
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,990
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all you know well known as</font>

639
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:29,639
ground truths as you say but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

640
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're treating everyone the</font>

641
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,680
same when in reality the very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very top</font>

642
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:36,629
ones have complex multilateral

643
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,660
relationships and like Jeff pointed out

644
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:41,910
you know bgp works on a prefix asses are

645
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:44,010
convenient grouping but clearly it

646
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:46,320
doesn't work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just strip</font>

647
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:48,600
out the bottom 90 something percent of

648
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,550
them and concentrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the complex</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ones</font>

649
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,330
you might have a better shot but then

650
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:56,100
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be your algorithm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

651
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:58,560
procedures have to be far more flexible

652
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:01,439
and complex if you want to do just the

653
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:03,090
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever however many there are then</font>

654
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,880
these things become much easier and

655
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:08,100
everything you say holds easily does

656
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,570
that make sense yeah okay what's the

657
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:13,649
chances of you doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a per</font>

658
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:15,740
prefix basis for level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three that's what</font>

659
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,740
I thought

660
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:21,690
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's thank the speaker</font>
