1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
next on our agenda is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lightning</font>

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:14,219
talks I think and the first one we have

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,198
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jess so Jeff while you get ready I</font>

4
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:20,160
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to remind you to fill out</font>

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,070
surveys and to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about if you want</font>

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,019
to nominate yourself to serve on any of

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:31,948
the committee's I think we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:34,500
time to to go and run right yeah the

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,170
deadline for pc and other committees are

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:45,300
tomorrow board is that's gone forever

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:48,030
right yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all set thank you and</font>

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,300
good afternoon everyone so Doug morn

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,910
told us this morning that he started

14
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,629
sponsoring work in DNS second supporting

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:00,480
it I think he said 2004 and it was going

16
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:04,319
to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10-year effort so he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only got</font>

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:08,429
two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go how well is he doing how</font>

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:10,259
far are we along the DNS set track so<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

19
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">ap Nick George Michelson and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> myself</font>

20
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,369
decided that we'd try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure this</font>

21
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,220
out by actually looking we had three

22
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,670
questions in mind how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many resolve is</font>

23
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,500
actually out there do the DNS SEC dance

24
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,299
but resolvers is only the supply side

25
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,600
what about the demand side the next

26
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,729
question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many of you folk and all</font>

27
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,210
the rest of the folk the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> users</font>

28
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,850
out there are actually going to obey DNS

29
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,759
SEC how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you will not load</font>

30
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:42,780
something that is deliberately DNS SEC

31
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:46,070
invalid and where are you so what do we

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,470
do adds a brilliant aren't they

33
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:53,008
everybody's seen an ad and if you embed

34
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:56,369
flash in an ad you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

35
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:59,070
piece of code executed all over the

36
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,829
internet so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> created a really boring</font>

37
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,589
ad and we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> some code in it and the</font>

38
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:07,139
code basically generated those two URLs

39
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,660
that every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> person who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ran the</font>

40
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,400
code generated a subtly different URL

41
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,700
because one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those strings was</font>

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,310
actually unique random

43
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,560
one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> URLs is deliberately broken</font>

44
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,530
and DNS SEC invalid the other one is

45
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,660
valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we ran it and we ran it like</font>

46
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,790
crazy way we work this<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 second timer</font>

47
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,810
till the results we used an online

48
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:31,660
advertisement<font color="#E5E5E5"> network google and it</font>

49
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,940

53
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,250
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 4.9 million</font>

54
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:47,790
impressions but most of you have the

55
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:50,319
attention span of a rather small<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT and</font>

56
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,900
you immediately flick off and do

57
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,420
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else but of those 4.9 million</font>

58
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:58,150
thank God 2.8 million weren't watching

59
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,339
and let the ad run for 10 seconds thank

60
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,950
you very much those 2.8 million people

61
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,190
we appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so what should be</font>

62
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:09,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on it's really easy you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked for</font>

63
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,250
an a record your<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS resolver if it is</font>

64
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,890
DNS SEC validating will then start

65
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,859
querying that a record when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets back</font>

66
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,529
an answer if it is DNS SEC validating

67
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:23,230
one way or another and the order doesn't

68
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,530
matter it will ask for DNS ki and des

69
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,959
records and do the DNS SEC validation

70
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,299
and then if it likes what it sees it

71
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,549
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> send back the a record to you the</font>

72
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:35,530
original user so that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little log of</font>

73
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:37,090
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd normally see in the DNS logs at</font>

74
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">see an a record and then my</font>

75
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,260
authoritative server would see a d/s or

76
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:45,040
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS key then the other life would be</font>

77
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:48,760
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I ran the ad for 2.8 million</font>

78
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,260
times how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many resolvers queried for</font>

79
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,290
these domains how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

80
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:56,470
resolvers are visible and secondly how

81
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:59,530
many of them also queried for DNS SEC so

82
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:04,859
I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> 126,000 780 resolvers of which a</font>

83
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:10,329
mere 3367 were doing DNS SEC resolution

84
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:11,919
two-point-six percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> hmm then someone</font>

85
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:14,230
said hang on a second<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a bit crap</font>

86
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,570
and it is because the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you folk</font>

87
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,789
do in DNS lenders make life unbelievably

88
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:20,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated you think home networks are</font>

89
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:22,240
a piece of crud go and have a look at

90
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,219
the infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the DNS and the</font>

91
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,380
way you chain resolvers together and

92
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,010
once you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there of DNS recursive</font>

93
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,990
validators

94
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:32,050
hanging behind non validators and so on

95
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:33,790
how do you tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> the difference how do</font>

96
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,790
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell the mess that's behind the</font>

97
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,620
resolve as you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at so what we</font>

98
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:42,130
actually found is that the folk who are

99
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:45,040
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns validation send me the dns key</font>

100
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:48,100
query really quickly and folklore

101
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,750
forwarders don't so if i look at the

102
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,700
time distribution and there it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font>

103
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,610
logarithmic scale there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really big</font>

104
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,400
peak at just under a second so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i put a</font>

105
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,170
filter in if you ask me for<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns key</font>

106
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,700
query within three seconds the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

107
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,770
time you ever get in<font color="#E5E5E5"> touch with me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

108
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:07,590
believe you're a validator otherwise

109
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:10,750
you're lying the numbers get worse only

110
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:15,130
2277 resolvers look like being DNS SEC

111
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:18,040
validating but maybe it's lower than

112
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,990
that because I had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> test didn't I I</font>

113
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,650
had one that was valid and one that was

114
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,290
invalid if you fetch the invalid object

115
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,789
you're not validating and if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

116
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,570
resolver you're using is one that I

117
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:35,470
thought was I was wrong so now I get

118
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:39,130
back down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real number 120 6780</font>

119
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:43,180
only 2123 to the DNS SEC validation

120
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:44,950
dance<font color="#CCCCCC"> amia one-point-six percent how</font>

121
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,870
about the big guys the professionals in

122
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,580
this business how well are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you doing if</font>

123
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,200
you have more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 clients out there</font>

124
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">twenty six thousand eight hundred</font>

125
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,670
resolvers slightly better results

126
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:57,550
three-point-one percent actually do DNS

127
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:59,440
SEC validation and other folk you<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

128
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:02,380
have one or two clients behind them a

129
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,300
little bit worse around<font color="#CCCCCC"> one percent so</font>

130
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:07,260
you kind of think the big guys do

131
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:10,210
validation don't you you'd be wrong

132
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:13,000
that's the top 20 of the biggest resolve

133
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:15,280
as I can see with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Korea on top none of</font>

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,550
them DNS SEC validate<font color="#CCCCCC"> except the route</font>

135
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,520
DNS resolvers behind comcast well done

136
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:25,510
comcast thank you everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else go</font>

137
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,969
figure the ones who do do DNS SEC

138
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,380
validation there's someone in the USA

139
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,880
there's someone in Ireland there's

140
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,060
someone in the Philippines<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was looking</font>

141
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else from the USA I can't</font>

142
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,370
see them either it is amazingly eclectic

143
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,750
so our collection of large resolvers are

144

146
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:47,020
do do it you're eating into my time I'll

147
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:49,000
answer you later now let's look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

148
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,580
other side all the way down over at

tested 1.7 million clients those the

00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,890
ones who actually landed through the

full ten seconds a phenomenal<font color="#CCCCCC"> 27,000 838</font>

153
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:05,349
actually did DNS SEC validation

154
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:08,500
one-point-six percent where can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we find</font>

in the Caribbean<font color="#CCCCCC"> czar really right up</font>

161
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:24,070
there but those are little countries how

162
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,570
about if i get rid of the little

163
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:29,110
countries and leave only the big

164
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:33,010
countries predictably<font color="#CCCCCC"> there sweden then</font>

165

island then chili and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> USA is there</font>

168
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,280
and how about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom of the list</font>

169
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:46,000
well the top of the bottom dubious honor

170
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,070
goes to Greece they can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> afford it and</font>

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,640
the top is is out there actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

172
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,440
doing DNS SEC validation there's a few

176
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,760
and figure out if you can see yourself

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:03,390
you're from the US you won't unless your

178

comcast everyone else is failing badly

179

the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> good news out of all of this</font>

180
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:15,820
there's more DNS SEC than v6 that's not

that's all thank you very much

Patrick you had a question sort of is

186
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,640
sort of this and it has its own country

about if the complications of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

195
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:13,170
years yes you're quite right so I would

196
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,540
expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when I give an answer back</font>

205
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:53,300
next one on stage is Stacy cool there he

the green one<font color="#CCCCCC"> home all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right I thought</font>

208
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">it would take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a few minutes and</font>

209
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,709
give an integration update for a couple

210
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">of pretty large networks that you guys</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">interest to at least a few people in the</font>

214
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,349
coffee and cookies so that's a good sign

215
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,750
so a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of points son just the</font>

216
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:30,330
phases of the integration obviously we

217
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,520
start with a strategic plan for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

218
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,410
integration we spent quite a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

219
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,569
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the most important</font>

220
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:39,270
issues on everyone's mind like are we

221
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do a s1 finally since we've had</font>

222
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,760
that for quite a long time are we going

223
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just use one of the other a esas and</font>

224
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,050
we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> that after a lot of financial</font>

225
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:52,410
analysis that there was too many

226
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:55,199
customer touches involved in moving both

227
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:58,350
networks over to a s1 so we decided to

228
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">settle on the one that leaving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the a s</font>

229
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,610
that had the least number of customer

230
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:05,640
impact involved which was migrating off

231
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:08,850
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> legacy global crossing AS unto</font>

232
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,310
as3 356 which is probably pretty

233
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,840
predictable to most people but for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

234
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you that were rooting for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us to go to</font>

235
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,160
a s1 we didn't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it done this time</font>

236
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,320
round and and given<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> size of the</font>

237
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,589
network now we probably won't ever get

238
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,590
there

239
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:35,540
this is do I have five hundred dollars

240
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:38,209
500<font color="#CCCCCC"> ehlers by 5i thought that so we</font>

241
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,280
debated some other questions to like are

242
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:41,690
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to adopt the Global Crossing</font>

243
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,390
model of having a fully converged

244
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,880
network with mpls and and VPN customers

245
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:49,520
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> voip customers on it or are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we going</font>

246
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have an architecture where we have</font>

247
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,199
separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> backbone for quality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of service</font>

248
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,820
and then a low cost high capacity high

249
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,950
scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet backbone and settled on</font>

250
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,930
the latter model where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have</font>

251
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:03,110
have separate network so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the</font>

252
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:05,630
direction the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS 3549 network will live</font>

253
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,810
on as it is becoming the the private

254
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:10,640
network over time and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are a</font>

255
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,310
VPN customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you have customers</font>

256
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,990
who are buying that service the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS will</font>

257
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,729
still live on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network is still live</font>

258
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:21,320
on but it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be scaled down as</font>

259
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:24,400
appropriate the next phase was to reset

260
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:28,160
the local preferences on the network

261
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:31,040
followed by later time moving individual

262
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,469
custom reports there was a bunch of

263
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,980
impacts from moving the custom reports

264
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:39,020
that they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice one was obviously</font>

265
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,850
the routing tables going to change even

266
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">though we use local AS and make it real</font>

267
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,180
easy for that migration to happen

268
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,880
suddenly the whole view<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the internet</font>

269
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,339
changes from having 3549 in front to

270
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,670
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3356 and along with that comes</font>

271
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:54,230
some shifts in customer preferences so

272
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,000
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of customers of three through five</font>

273
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,220
six will now look closer than they did

274
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,610
before some will look further away so

275
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:04,160
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will cause some traffic to to slosh</font>

276
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:07,670
around another thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will cause</font>

277
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,350
some traffic / is the fact that level 3

278
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:13,790
has all their router<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs numbered out of</font>

279
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:15,680
the four dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> X address space which means</font>

280
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,500
it's going to win more<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP tiebreakers</font>

281
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,290
so if another reason than the fact that

282
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,970
we win some more tiebreakers once your

283
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,490
pork gets moved over you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might see quite</font>

284
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,350
a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic move over that was</font>

285
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:32,740
previously more evenly distributed

286
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:35,750
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> your other providers and then</font>

287
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,230
last but not least also there's some BGP

288
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,840
communities that

289
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:42,000
that are a little different and you

290
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,430
should really when you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

291
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,750
maintenance notification look at the

292
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,209
documentation that comes with that

293
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,920
notification and identify how you might

294
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,990
want to change your BGP communities if

295
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,510
you're using some special<font color="#CCCCCC"> features like</font>

296
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,800
backup only and things like that those

297
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:59,130
announcements are going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

298
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,750
change during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the migration other than</font>

299
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,610
those pieces everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> else is going to</font>

300
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,620
remain pretty much the same so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

301
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,200
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> log</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in to your customer portal and</font>

302
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,700
see all your stats your<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill is not</font>

304
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,530
taken care of all that so we only messed

305
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,170
it is really on the table during the

306
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:20,400
migration is going to be the the shifts

307
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:22,199
that are pointed out here for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

308
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,240
phase is going to involve uplinking

309
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,490
entire routers over so that we can start

310
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">moving customers around hundreds at a</font>

311
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:31,650
time from one<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other that'll</font>

312
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,270
still involve local alias changes so you

313
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,640
won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be on the line when we do</font>

314
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:37,560
the migration but there could still be

315
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,750
the traffic issues that occur the

316
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,420
evening of that migrations are going to

317
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,520
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep an eye on the traffic and</font>

318
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">so all the other issues that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

319
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,650
associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the port moves are also</font>

320
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:53,220
associated with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the router up blank</font>

321
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:55,709
moves and then the final phase of the

322
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,570
migration will be a big flag day where

323
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,830
the engineers all get drunk because

324
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:01,560
we're scared as hell what's going to

325
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:03,090
happen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the entire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a s changes</font>

326
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:08,430
for every remaining customer on the

327
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:10,260
backbone so current progress strategic

328
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:12,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">planning is complete we finished at</font>

329
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,939
about three<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after the the</font>

330
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:20,100
integration or after the acquisition

331
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:23,160
happened last October the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP local</font>

332
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,530
preference change happened last November

333
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,280
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's been in place quite some time</font>

334
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:31,680
now the tactical planning around a

335
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,870
specific moves has been going on since

336
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">April of this year but I'd say it's</font>

337
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,910
really only started getting into a good

338
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:41,069
rhythm in August now we've only moved a

339
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,430
handful of ports like maybe a dozen

340
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:46,200
ports but we're expecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move</font>

341
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:49,199
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of additional customers in</font>

342
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,000
just the next few months so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you hit</font>

343
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,190
you probably haven't seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge impact</font>

344
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,210
yet but but that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be coming</font>

345
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:59,490
real soon now another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

346
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:01,950
we're doing is with particular big

347
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,050
customers which a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you are in this</font>

348
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">room right now it's real important that</font>

349
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:10,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have a planning conversation about</font>

350
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:12,090
this if you have 20 ports or more

351
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,100
scattered across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country or really</font>

352
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:17,130
even two ports on different sides of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

353
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:20,160
country and we decide to move one of

354
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:21,689
your ports in one city and leave all the

355
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,540
rest of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ports</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that could potentially</font>

356
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,640
cause a lot of problems for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and and</font>

357
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,219
some early experiences have shown that

358
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,390
this is the case even with some content

359
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,700
customers where we wouldn't have

360
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,110
expected the impact<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be quite so</font>

361
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:39,570
negative it's turned<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to have very</font>

362
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:41,640
negative consequences so so please my

363
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:43,080
recommendation actually for complex

364
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,990
customers that have lots of ports<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

365
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,370
talked to your account team and get in

366
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,410
touch with them and manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own</font>

367
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,060
migration from one network to another

368
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:54,089
that's bound to be much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more effective</font>

369
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:56,670
than waiting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to cut particular</font>

370
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:58,410
ports over in particular cities and then

371
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,280
the big flag day that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned is</font>

372
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:03,870
tentatively scheduled<font color="#CCCCCC"> for late next year</font>

373
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,250
now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys probably just delete your</font>

374
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:09,329
maintenance notifications you get from

375
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:11,310
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> carrier's I'm guessing yes this</font>

376
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:12,750
one's might be hard to tell this one's

377
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:15,810
actually different<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the normal one</font>

378
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:18,540
that you delete this one has a little

379
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:20,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">note down near the bottom that says this</font>

380
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:24,089
this maintenance<font color="#E5E5E5"> is associated with a</font>

381
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">network groom and there's a link to a</font>

382
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:29,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">page where you can get more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

383
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:31,260
about what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change when the</font>

384
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:33,420
night that that the maintenance takes

385
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,750
place so please keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> an eye out for this</font>

386
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:39,420
special notification we are also we put

387
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:42,510
a hack in place inside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> product team</font>

388
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:45,180
which is the group that I work in to

389
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:47,129
notify the account teams when we've

390
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,350
processed and approved a groom's package

391
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:50,760
which means you could get moved sometime

392
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,919
in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of months just so</font>

393
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,500
that they have a heads up but in case

394
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:58,640
that fails you<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely keep an eye</font>

395
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,860
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the maintenance notifications</font>

396
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,410
one other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just an operational</font>

397
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:07,020
point and maybe also a train

398
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">you point for some folks as well there</font>

399
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,260
was a gentleman<font color="#E5E5E5"> who contacted me</font>

400
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">off-list who was having a lot of trouble</font>

401
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,780
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> his routing to work correctly</font>

402
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,870
and he was kind of blaming it on the the

403
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:22,530
BGP community policy change that we made

404
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:24,510
where the level<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network prefers the</font>

405
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,720
legacy Global Crossing network over

406
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:30,030
other peers and vice versa saying well

407
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,800
you're overriding my<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP preferences and</font>

408
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,050
whatnot and this is the topology that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

409
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,780
had he had it was a small wireless isp

410
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,730
and he had a transit connection from

411
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,000
time warner cable and then he had a much

412
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:44,460
smaller transit connection to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tier two</font>

413
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,790
carrier who was buying from level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

414
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,950
and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCCW and he was trying to get</font>

415
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,300
all of his traffic to come in through

416
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,550
through time warner cable and he

417
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:56,129
couldn't figure out why that wasn't

418
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:58,860
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> correctly so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I worked with them</font>

419
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,620
and we got things fixed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> where his tyr</font>

420
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:04,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">to upstream was finally sending us the</font>

421
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,870
BGP communities to tag his routes as

422
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,720
being backup routes so that time warner

423
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:11,310
cable wouldn't be preferred but of

424
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,190
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see based on the diagram</font>

425
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:16,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the thick diagrams show the</font>

426
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:19,830
customer preference which is always<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

427
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:22,490
