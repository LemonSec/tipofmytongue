<font color="#E5E5E5">the break sponsors there's a big sign</font>

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">ahead and visit their tables they're</font>

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,139
giving away t-shirts and stuff like that

the breakfast is always really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good and</font>

it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to come to now I can</font>

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,460
have a nice breakfast especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,240
half a bottle of gin every day so it's

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,640
really nice to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some bacon and eggs</font>

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,210
up yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> doug mon was talking about</font>

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,729
some of the things that DHS we're doing

23
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,159
for the internet and he talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

24
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,840
effort to promote DNS SEC and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he said</font>

he'd been<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this for his effort had</font>

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,150
been out for eight years or<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I've been</font>

27
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">with DNS SEC for about 16 years or so</font>

28
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,720
somewhere in there and I decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font>

29
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">back at the archives of now I can see</font>

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,548
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time i talked about DNS SEC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in that presentation I was</font>

33
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,829
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was going</font>

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be so this presentation is now a</font>

35
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,820
decade later it's actually about

36
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,060
deployment early deployment observations

37
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,419
and the reason why I began doing this

38
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,189
work was we are company decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to roll</font>

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,020
out DNS SEC we want to figure out what

40
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,880
are the parameters needed to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNA sec</font>

41
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,770
the protocol definition is out there on

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,750
paper but the lots of numbers you need

43
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,479
to configure how bigger keys how long do

44
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,920
you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often you do things so I started</font>

45
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying oh look at the TL DS they're all</font>

46
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,369
experts will see what they do and kind

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,280
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with some averages see what</font>

happens out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in doing this work but</font>

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,439
became more interesting was looking at

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:09,119
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> behavior of operations in adopting a</font>

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,829
new extension<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a protocol so the one</font>

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,989
of my ground rules in this presentation

53
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,740
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't name names i'm studying</font>

54
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:17,130
operations

55
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,390
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> places operators have different</font>

56
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,609
requirements so they do things

57
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,339
differently in places they also come

58
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">down to have a herd mentality but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

59
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,710
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have is is trying to look at the</font>

60
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,390
policies not the actual availability

61
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,670
that the precise numbers of whether

62
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,429
they're up or down and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to judge the operators decisions</font>

64
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">just kind of report on what influences</font>

65
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,400
them and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some of this is</font>

66
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">from feedback I've already gotten over</font>

67
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,620
the past year presenting on this topic

68
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,140
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talk about is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

69
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,390
differences of what I see from what I

70
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">expected to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see and i was asked one time</font>

71
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:57,209
why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have expectations and this</font>

72
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,200
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because early on I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> participating</font>

73
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,660
in writing from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> early code</font>

74
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,720
workshopping the protocol at that time

75
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,770
as a developer of the extensions we

76
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,359
expected the protocol to roll at a

77
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,820
certain way we designed it for certain

78
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,650
requirements we saw this is where we

79
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,540
want to go with a protocol and we

80
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,890
assumed that in the future it would be

81
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,810
run a certain way so we built<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

82
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,279
into the protocol that's what the

83
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,660
expectations come from it's from

84
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,460
basically the IETF side of the house

85
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,920
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in working with operators now</font>

86
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,510
for almost 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> years in developing the</font>

87
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,040
stuff its funnel to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say what</font>

88
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,019
things do operators pick up out of the

89
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,220
rfcs and one things that they not take

90
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,960
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC's that's become an</font>

91
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:39,450
interesting topic to look at adoption

92
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,030
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a topic that I'm really trying</font>

93
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,290
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put out to boldly here but this just</font>

94
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,500
gives you an idea of where we are the

95
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:49,590
the large the Lord green slices are

96
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,300
those zones that don't do DNS SEC I

97
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,880
didn't choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> the color scheme it was</font>

98
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,460
kind of thrown on me so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

99
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,350
right now most still don't do dns second

100
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:02,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds the upper the root zone and the</font>

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">tlds there are 11</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tests tlds out there</font>

102
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,030
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS X sine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> die don't count them</font>

103
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,100
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's fair to count them as</font>

104
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,660
operational examples it gives you an

105
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,340
idea of where we are over about a

106
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:16,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">15-month change what I did find</font>

107
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,390
interesting about the deployment though

108
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,829
is it's seasonal it's pretty obvious

109
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,830
that engineers<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like to work during</font>

110
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:25,020
vacation time in the summer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we skip</font>

111
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,300
the holidays Jan there are no changes in

112
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,460
January<font color="#CCCCCC"> inputting</font>

113
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,319
the slides together<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a couple</font>

bowls of the bomb there a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dots</font>

115

there in<font color="#E5E5E5"> August one's own was signed in</font>

116
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,490
September one's own was signed and then

117
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:40,349
I wanted a vacation for<font color="#E5E5E5"> two weeks in</font>

118
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,229
october and had to rush to make the set

119
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:45,270
of slides<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back since i made</font>

120
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:47,190
these slides three zones of side in the

121
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,620
last week it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> october it's time to make</font>

122
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:53,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">changes i guess it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also seems to</font>

123
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,770
coincide with all the conferences<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

124
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,060
in trying to measure DNS SEC I'm not

125
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to give you a DNS like tutorial</font>

126
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,210
not trying to get deeply into what all

127
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,219
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> parameters mean but this gives you</font>

128
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,680
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I measured first thing</font>

129
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:07,409
is key management first thing to look at

130
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,719
is what kind of keys are put in a play

131
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:12,870
what are the roles of keys what kind of

132
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:15,690
cryptography is used and then how often

133
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,819
do changes happen in the keys that are

134
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,830
under management then I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

135
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:22,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">something involving that the trust chain</font>

136
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:25,050
the so-called<font color="#E5E5E5"> des record and the measure</font>

137
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:27,000
of what it means and what it shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

138
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,650
operators and then they get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,479
negative answer section because negative

140
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,830
answer has a choice to make in dns

141
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,900

the root zone cryptography in

165
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,300
cryptography when we developed original

166
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:35,399
software we assumed that operators would

167
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,320
sign the zone with multiple algorithms

168
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,289
for diversity that would be good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sign</font>

169
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,009
with RSA we could assign with DSA so we

170
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:42,539
wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> the software</font>

172
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:47,759
wrote very intricate protocol

173

development protocol designs to say you

174
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,460
know if you see this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of key in this</font>

175
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,740
kind of key you can mix and match your

177
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm surprised is that for any</font>

183
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:05,550
multiple algorithms out there there's no

184
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:09,349
reason to have a diversity that we

185
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:11,460
assume would be there over time

186
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:13,620
cryptography improves that we see new

187
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,149
new algorithms out there and when a new

188
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,919
one came out there we looked at the next

189
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:19,289
thing was which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> more popular than</font>

newer the old one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on the next slide</font>

192
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,919
right here the in the old days the old

00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:28,139
was popular nowadays the new one has

194
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,688
just overtaken it but which interesting

195
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:32,249
is only two operators have switched the

196
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:33,779
algorithm they use they just stick with

197
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:36,509
what they have because the incremental

198
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:38,939
benefit isn't isn't there to Force one

199

to change algorithms and all the

200
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:44,669
headaches that's involved with this key

201
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:46,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">links were suggested in RFC 4641 which</font>

they reverse the two numbers the other

one though is a zone which consciously

219
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:31,680
went with different numbers because they

220
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:34,889
did a study decided that was the optimal

221
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,769
way to run security and message sizes

222
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:39,959
and i asked the operator about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

months ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and guidance stories about</font>

one one person piped up and said

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:59,010
when they were designing their DNS SEC

232
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,199
they went in commission to study what's

233
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,060
the right size keys for this and they

234
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,490
found<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the key size is used by</font>

this oddball operator were the right

committee says no no don't do what's

239
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,860
optimal according to your studies follow

240
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,410
the herd<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pick 2 K 1 K and just go</font>

242
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:25,319
come to bear on operational choices so

243
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,970
and I have a bottom of lances once this

244
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,370
is one sign that better guidance on

245
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,050
cryptography is needed when I looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

246
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,120
my 11 year old slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually had a</font>

247
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,040
slide saying unstudied cryptography tell

248
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,990
us what to do nothing's happened in 10

249
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:43,140
years lifetimes and durations how long

250
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,180
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use a key the key recommendations</font>

251
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,870
so the expectations were one year for KS

252
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,099
KS a one-month Rozier's k's after we

253
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,680
started rolling things out the root zone

254
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,210
was signed two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I think crypto</font>

255
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,339
experts said why you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to</font>

256
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,630
change keys until they break but then

257
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">opera said well if they break we have to</font>

258
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">change wait to practice and so no one</font>

259
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">really has any good idea of what to do</font>

260
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,850
at this point so i looked at the

261
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">frequency of changes and even though i</font>

262
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,810
have more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a year of observations</font>

264
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,619
enough to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed only for them</font>

267
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,829
conclusions beyond that CSK's there have

268
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,570
been a lot operators tend to like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:03,990
what we feel we can we can handle

287
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,279
response sizes and I say it's because

288
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,660
i'm also an operator and we actually

289
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">make that decision that was too much</font>

290
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:13,740

00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,239
space and<font color="#CCCCCC"> time if we like to have you</font>

292
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,100

00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,390

295
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:24,360
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is showing here is that</font>

296
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:26,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">roughly two to one ratio of operators at</font>

297
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,200
up that put out<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one key and</font>

298
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,630
minimize their message size two

299
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,220
operators that put both keys out there

300
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:36,180
and don't worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the message size</font>

301
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:38,339
right now some of the thoughts and it's

302
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,709
the size of mentioned dance is a serious

303
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:44,279
consideration 512 bytes was the

304
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:46,050
traditional limit for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a DNS we see a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

305
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,000
of firewalls that have limited us to

306
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,250
that and in general there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

307
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,020
of padding around the DNS system to make

308
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that DNS doesn't cause problems for</font>

309
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,920
us the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we deal with the</font>

310
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:57,930
size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these things we are concerned</font>

311
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,510
about large size<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS responses for the</font>

312
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,239
application attacks and there's also

313
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,400
concern about you EP fragmentation out

314
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,310
there but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think</font>

315
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,630
anyone has any really good point data on

316
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,760
this stuff I've seen presentations

317
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:14,040
talking about this issue but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font>

318
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">really have any definitive we've got to</font>

319
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,959
be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these numbers right now you know</font>

320
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,520
it's evident the operators are tinkering

321
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,410
with key management it's a new field

322
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,540
just like 10 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> we still don't</font>

323
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,310
have a really good handle on how to deal

324
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,099
with cryptography with Indians community

325
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,779
and I've been saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for quite a</font>

326
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,010
while we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know people if someone</font>

327

00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:36,209
helpful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see his academic studies</font>

331
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:44,700
guidance documents out there but still

332
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,990
no real practical experience on the

00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">other hand to there have been some</font>

334
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,250
operators that have gone against the

335
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,779
grain completely there have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been six</font>

337
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:56,130
changes their keys out there in fact 11

338

operator has actually never made a

339
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:00,839
change in any of his DNS SEC parameters

340
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,339
since he started and I talked to him

341
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it and he's you know he's aware</font>

342
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:09,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's done this this way a second example</font>

343
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:11,579
is one operatives actually recycled keys

344
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,020
they use a key it comes in they use it

345
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:14,790
they throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> it away but then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it comes</font>

346
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,110
back again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that operator</font>

00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">2 and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're</font>

348
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:21,600
doing these are things we didn't expect

349
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see in the protocol development days</font>

350
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,860
but underhand no one's had a problem so

351
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,900
we don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if these are good or bad</font>

352
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,570
ways of doing things good bad sense of

353
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:33,810
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's being somewhere trying</font>

354
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:36,390
different approaches we have some

355
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,040
documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can refer to but we</font>

356
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,300
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have best practices anywhere no</font>

357
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,829
one's documented the best way to do

358
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,930
things we argue about the best way to do

359
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:45,540
things all the time but no one's got a

360
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:48,390
consensus and I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

361
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,480
why I bring this up is enhance answering

362
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:54,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">rfps for dns service some of the art</font>

363
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,250
piece we want compliance with RFC 4641

364
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,530
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm trying to say is that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

365
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,720
a document you want compliance with it

366
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:02,939
doesn't always<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense a document</font>

367
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,400
wasn't meant to be a compliance document

368
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,410
in fact it's even self inconsistent in

369
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,870
the way it specifies<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone numbers in</font>

370
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,270
there and it also has a key clause that

371
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,640
it for the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> five years these are the</font>

372
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,110
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should do key management and</font>

373
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,569
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was written six years ago so it's</font>

374
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,370
timed out by itself so if you're running

375
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:23,250
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to write an RFP for our</font>

376
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,570
dns service read the documents you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

377
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,890
to see compliance with an actually

378
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:29,180
describe what you want out of them

379
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:32,370
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all them have requirements</font>

380
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:35,670
now in building the trust chain this is

381
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:38,190
a another element of DNS SEC because has

382
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:39,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do with a d/s record and there are</font>

383
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,730
two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the d/s record how</font>

384
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:45,000
long does a d/s record take to appear

385
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:49,260
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> also how is it put in the zone</font>

386
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,670
and the first this delay best knowledge

387
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have for this it's kind of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

388
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,510
when you sign use Owens kind of gaining

389
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,729
engaged putting the d/s record into the

00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">root zone is like now getting the I Do's</font>

391
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:01,950
I'm married now it's a commitment part

392
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:04,020
so this shows that you know once a zone

393
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,310
has signed how long are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they sure that</font>

394
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,800
this signing is going to work before

395
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:10,920
they want to count when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> made that</font>

396
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:12,479
commitment what's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of surprising in</font>

397
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,729
there to me is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first the first green</font>

398
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,500
slice is so big that's immediate meaning

399
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,300
that there is owns out there that have

400
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,660
signed themselves and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the same day</font>

00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,850
that did not exist the day before there

404

in RFC 4509 which to find a new hash

when this document was put out there we

had one hash algorithm and all the

425
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:18,610
software out there does that today but

<font color="#CCCCCC">not all the software understands this</font>

428
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:22,660
new hash algorithm right now they

understands the hash<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm but</font>

430
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,469
doesn't understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DS records</font>

431
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:29,319
reference to it so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to maintain</font>

432
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:32,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old configuration in the new so for</font>

434
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:37,959
the new hash so in this chart here the

435
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:40,929
green slice shows that the zones that

436
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:43,449
only have the old hash out there they've

437
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:46,569
not adopted that this RFC support yet

438
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:48,279
the yellow show the zones that do both

439
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:51,819
they do with the RFC says they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

440
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:54,129
the old and the new and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the orange show</font>

the zones that only have the new and

00:16:54,129 --> 00:17:01,600
disregard the old value now the any two

443
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these slices are compatible the green</font>

and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> yellow the yellow and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> orange</font>

445
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,510
ideas are compatible the poem is is that

446
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:11,140
right now because we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some zones</font>

447
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:13,720
which only have the old hash and we have

448
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:16,089
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> zones with a new hash only all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

449
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,199
clients have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand both so</font>

450
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:19,510
they've pushed the pressure on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

451
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,709
clients to maintain compatibility for

452
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,669
the old and new and the reason why we

453
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:23,559
have the new one is something you'll

454
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:31,690
feel the old one is susceptible to being

455
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:33,580
hacked basically so interesting thing

456
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,929
here is that the RFC says that we should

457
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,668
keep the old around as long as we need

458
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:39,250
it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going</font>

459
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:40,990
to be there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no way to tell my dns what</font>

460
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,840
the clients capabilities are we can't

461
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,880
measure

462
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,389
how many the clients don't do the newer

463
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,799
don't do the old the reason why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

464
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,059
so many that say they only have the new

465
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,650
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because the root zone</font>

466
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,450
signed only with the new hash<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font>

467
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,090
and that's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> the justification for</font>

468
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,650
some some of the operators but we do

469
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,549
need in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS protocol to have a way</font>

470
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,870
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> measure capabilities of our clients</font>

471
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:06,350
the third thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I measured here was the</font>

472
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:08,899
no factor how do you say no<font color="#E5E5E5"> most TLD su</font>

generalizable decision for all zones out

476
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,960
there because then Secretary has certain

advantages for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tlds but that's the</font>

assault assault is something it's the

483
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:35,210
use in there and it says you should

484
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,309
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the salt every reciting and it</font>

485
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:40,340
also has an iteration parameter which

486
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:44,000
should be a low number now the problem

487
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:46,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that document right now is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

488
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,539
every week every signing is kind of like

489
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,879
a batch operation like when do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sign</font>

your zone well<font color="#E5E5E5"> till these don't sign our</font>

491
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,750
zones we sign records as we need to

assign sets of data as we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it's</font>

all<font color="#E5E5E5"> incremental so the looking at the</font>

494
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,730
salt change frequency is actually kind

495
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:03,620
of interesting the green slice are<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

496
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:05,720
that have never changed their salt and

497
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,500
all the time I've been looking that's

498
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,179
kind of excessively not doing work<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

499
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,070
way although<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one's sure that it's a</font>

500
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:16,010
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea because no one's ever to crack</font>

501
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,600
this the yellow<font color="#E5E5E5"> slice is the other end</font>

502
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:19,700
those are zones that change their

503
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,730
they're sold at least daily in fact one

504
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,740
is every 10 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found that by</font>

505
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,809
looking at their data every time as they

506
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,309
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do change your salt and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

507
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:29,360
has implications for had to re signing a

508
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:31,399
lot of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the zone it's a lot of</font>

509
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,320
work to change of salt and then there

510
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:35,689
are a few that<font color="#E5E5E5"> any other color slices</font>

511
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,668
that have varying<font color="#CCCCCC"> levels of how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

512
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,370
they do make changes they do it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

513
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:42,710
clock of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have a batch</font>

514
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,418
signing day so it's like every month two

515
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,690
months or three months when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see new</font>

516
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:49,730
salt out there kind of a fun thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

517
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,140
measure is what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> the salt value the</font>

518
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:55,370
salts will to a bunch of hex digits

519
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,820
random is better than not I think I dad

520
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,429
fell

521
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,960
is in many zones they operators tend to

522
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,840
use the same salt across the zones they

523
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:06,140
run<font color="#E5E5E5"> zones</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> operas not one-to-one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font>

way bad fella<font color="#E5E5E5"> coffee beef scalable and</font>

525
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,870
baseball and bed fella<font color="#E5E5E5"> my ask the guy</font>

526
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,699
who did bad fella they said well we

527
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,929
thought no one would notice or they

528
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,230
forgot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change it when they went to</font>

529
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:20,690
production baseball is in use by and

530
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:23,210
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> name no names by a registry that</font>

531
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:24,890
has nothing to do with baseball and I

532
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:28,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">said you know that's our game so are you</font>

533
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:30,290
can't use it it's still there fact that

534
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,730
nation hasn't produced a major league

535
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:36,280
baseball player in about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred years</font>

536
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:38,420
so so yeah I hold that<font color="#E5E5E5"> against them</font>

537
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,350
insect three iterations this is know

538
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,230
that this is just interesting because

539
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,919
it's supposed to be low it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matta</font>

540
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,190
calculating some number over and over

541
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:48,020
again 0 means that the TLD and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font>

542
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,850
this not from observations but from

543
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,740
talking to people that they didn't use n

544
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,389
sector e4 the the hash and they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

545
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the opt out for the</font>

546
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:59,500
scalability of what n sector he gives

547
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:02,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">them the yellow starts the those who do</font>

548
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:05,420
11 to 25 you get through half of the

549
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:08,450
moretti<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 to 10 is the the next big</font>

550
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:11,530
slice the interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the document is</font>

551
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:16,400
that it says don't go above 150 and

552
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:18,050
somebody does 150 so apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

553
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,480
scan the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said oh I see a</font>

554
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:22,190
number 150 let me use it that's a guess

555
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,910
I didn't I've never been able to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

556
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:28,340
that that TLD again the word low is

557
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:33,340
relative you know is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's low is</font>

558
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:36,820
six low who knows so we have these

559
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:38,899
different interpretations out there so

560
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,310
okay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went pretty quickly through</font>

561
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,750
the first couple of slides so I'm

562
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,370
actually running out of time but my

563
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:46,400
summary slide here and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

564
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:48,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">was one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like one of the</font>

565
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,540
points I should make and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

566
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,520
place for it earlier in talking to the

567
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,220
operators one of the major factors is

568
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,290
that the tools that they can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

569
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,670
of times the<font color="#E5E5E5"> choices are for are forced</font>

570
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,110
on them by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source software</font>

571
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:04,100
choices they made earlier in their

572
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:05,360
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so implementers of tools are</font>

573
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,980
very important to reach out to and say

574
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,379
look we if you put these parameters in

575
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,580
here it will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> used it's</font>

576
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,180
easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> than letting the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> operators</font>

577
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:16,909
actually fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> tune down on the last nub</font>

578
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:19,310
key change changing algorithms much<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

579
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:21,230
mentioned only to have done it's been

580
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,190
it's possible but for quite a while we

581
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:23,660
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there might have been a</font>

582
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem with a protocol spec because</font>

583
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,260
none of the tools could do it we figured

584
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">out it was the tools that couldn't do it</font>

585
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:33,379
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the specification was wrong</font>

586
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:35,120
the guidance of cryptography is needed I

587
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,790
wrote that down without raising how

588
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,689
ironically predictive that was ten years

589
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:44,120
ago and really yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pitched this a</font>

590
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,490
certain areas for Reese with their more

591
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,840
research than operational and maybe

592
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:49,700
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there starting to go out and</font>

593
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,659
say what if iterations this goes from

594
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:55,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">one to ten and so on up the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dns protocol</font>

595
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,560
improvement we need is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

596
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,150
measuring one we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of old</font>

597
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">croft in the protocol it's just like</font>

598
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,750
reading stuff right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we can't get rid</font>

599
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,920
of anything it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just DNS SEC we</font>

600
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,840
have all these are our types that we've

601
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,310
allocated that no one uses there's like

602
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,840
100 or are types out there we use maybe

603
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:15,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">20 10 to 20 of them are actually active</font>

604
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,720
use and finally we all like to avoid

605
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,270
vacations and holidays when we do our

606
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:25,880
upgrades and in that show is pretty

607
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:27,830
clearly so we for questions we have time

608
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">for one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or two questions if anyone has a</font>

609
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:31,070
question that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very complete</font>

610
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,280
that you answered<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question I was</font>

611
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:38,800
going to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> so sorry should one in your</font>

612
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,800
summary slides so any questions Fred

613
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:44,110
seeing not<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thanks ed that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was very</font>

614
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">good</font>
