7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,229
couple minutes going in a break here to

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,509
remind everyone of the change that we're

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:33,300
which is moving to the Monday Wednesday

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:37,079
program bit of an eye chart yeah I now

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,110
sorry if you try representing three days

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:44,489
on one slide three tightly packed days

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,899
in one slide so just to basically give

15
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,640
everyone the framework as I know you

16
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,260
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see this and I also know it's not</font>

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,140
up on the website we threw this together

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,989
today for presentation this morning is

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:01:00,030
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tutorials move to monday</font>

20
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:02,038
morning the conference opening is after

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,290
lunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will likely move it's not</font>

22
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,090
confirmed yet but we will likely move to

23
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,860
having a newcomers lunch instead of

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,540
newcomers breakfast which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:15,210
can sleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and it'd be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little more</font>

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,130
pleasant to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the to the newcomers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i know</font>

27
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,119
that i'm usually not until I've had my

28
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:27,179
first cup of coffee and we will then

29
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:29,280
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin track in the afternoon which</font>

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,540
will be up against one other track and

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,880
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully I'm not sure if we'll speak</font>

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,950
about it more today or the next night on

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,399
but what the idea is behind the

34
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,740
programming of that track beer gear

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,890
remains on Monday socials just as they

36
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,869
are Tuesday<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wednesday the main</font>

37
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,850
difference tuesday would be basically

38
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,229
the same with the exception that we may

39
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,030
move the member meeting to that

40
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:59,789
afternoon or possibly monday afternoon

41
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:01,530
unsure on that one and on Wednesday will

42
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,960
put the peering track given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it is</font>

43
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,820
are you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> best attended track by</font>

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,179
itself so that people don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

45
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,250
choose between that and other tracks in

46
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,870
the afternoon which will then also allow

47
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,690
the sponsors who

48
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,000
early end up with at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least a once yearly</font>

49
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:22,109
separate peering social to put that

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,700
afterwards on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wednesday so there any</font>

51
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:31,950
questions I can answer about this back

52
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">left-hand corner</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lou I did iron how is</font>

53
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,708
this going to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the next joint</font>

54
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,989
meeting in the following October what's

55
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:41,510
the plan for the air and cut over on

56
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,510
wednesday so job you want

57
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:56,599
so the turning for some reason so the

58
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,670
the fact is we'd like to have the

59
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:01,819
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to consider policy proposals in</font>

60
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:04,369
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nano community as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron</font>

61
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:07,280
community to that extent we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked</font>

62
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,540
out with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan dog having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this slot when</font>

63
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,920
we're having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a joint meeting we don't</font>

64
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,079
need to have the slot because we're

65
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be meeting later in the week so</font>

66
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,760
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only when nan dogs meeting alone</font>

67
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:19,099
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the februari and the Jewish</font>

68
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,510
meetings that we'd be doing this a joint

69
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:22,220
meeting will still be a joint<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting on</font>

70
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,340
the regular agenda I don't know whether

71
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,780
Nana will double up that track or not

72
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,180
over time there is a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> question if</font>

73
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,120
that works well whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not we'll</font>

74
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,280
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron meetings a year I mean</font>

75
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously if we've got more slots to</font>

76
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,400
call consider policy and as policy

77
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,160
stabilizes we may not have as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> vivo</font>

78
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,989
policy going forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

79
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">one Aaron meeting a year would suffice</font>

80
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:50,209
and the rest would be done at forums

81
00:03:47,540 --> 00:04:00,920
like this and other operator forums<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

82
00:03:50,209 --> 00:04:03,769
thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean any other questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we</font>

83
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:07,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">will go to break now we'll be back at</font>
