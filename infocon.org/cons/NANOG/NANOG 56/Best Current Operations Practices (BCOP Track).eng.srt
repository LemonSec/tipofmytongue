the idea behind that letter C and the

these documents as live as possible so

what's a b-cup well it really is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

meetings like these or any kind of

operator forms around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world what you</font>

70
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:29,109
find out is that documents are presented

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the form of PowerPoint they're</font>

prevent presented in the form of mailing

75
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:41,500
presented their relatively stale in that

76
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,229
we live in this fluid world where<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

77
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,810
change constantly so the real trouble is

78
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:49,270
that when you go searching<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some kind</font>

79
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">of document you can find things in</font>

80
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,810
archives but they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the world</font>

81
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:54,820
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these operational meetings</font>

82
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,160
they're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to tell if they were</font>

83
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,719
vetted and for the most part when you're

84
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,210
reading powerpoints you don't get the

85
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,800
text that went along<font color="#E5E5E5"> with those</font>

86
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,510
conversations so you have this missing

87
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,770
gap of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dialogue that could fill out</font>

88
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,820
the potentially very important

89
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">information as it pertains to you so the</font>

90
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea is to you know create these</font>

91
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,919
documents that are current for anybody

92
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:17,349
who needs them and it's anything

93
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:19,900
internet engineering related is not just

94
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:22,090
IP it just turns out that that was the

95
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:24,789
only domain name we could get so I PB

96
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:29,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">cop that org is really just it's about</font>

97
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:31,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">vco peas so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the room is really about</font>

98
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:33,550
participation from authors subject

99
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,870
matter experts people who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

100
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">willing to donate their time for</font>

101
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:41,409
shepherding people who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font>

102
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">these particular the final documents and</font>

103
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:45,940
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course if you have questions and</font>

104
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:47,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to submit a topic for help to</font>

105
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,849
get people to write these kind of things

106
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,110
this is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> forum to do it in</font>

107
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:55,419
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has obviously got huge value</font>

108
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,060
right the ideas eventually you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font>

109
00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:00,039
make the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> better you say you</font>

110
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,080
know I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> setting up i Gress</font>

111
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:04,060
or egress filtering and you say oh well

112
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,940
just check<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the IPP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cup site there's</font>

113
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,500
a current documentation on how what you

114
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,680
should follow for guidelines<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how to</font>

115
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,880
do the best current operational practice

116
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,229
it's also really nice when you're trying

117
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go back to your boss or your</font>

118
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:18,699
organization and say you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we</font>

119
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">should move this way as an organization</font>

120
00:06:18,699 --> 00:06:23,110
and here's why and by the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a</font>

121
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:25,240
very well vetted document to back that

122
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:30,610
up so it helps you with your own

123
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:32,800
internal justification as well and also

124
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,419
the ideas for this to be you know in one

125
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,069
central place so regardless of whether

126
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:38,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">or not this comes out of you know any</font>

127
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:41,259
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the five regions or all of the</font>

128
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:44,349
you know 50 60 70 little tiny operator

129
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:46,030
groups that happen around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> globe you</font>

130
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:48,729
can get these in one single place that's

131
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:51,190
searchable indexable easy to find and

132
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:54,280
really independent of any of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR or</font>

133
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:56,229
operator groups so these should start

134
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,270
popping up around in a lot more forums

135
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,530
of presented these at a bunch of

136
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">different forums and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh chris is</font>

00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,849
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really trying to help spread this</font>

139
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:09,099
as far reach as we possibly can to make

00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:16,060
these extremely relevant very current

141
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:17,590
and available<font color="#E5E5E5"> globally so recent changes</font>

142
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,440
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> CLP so for those of you don't know</font>

143

other people for about three and a half

145
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:28,690
years and it's tough right it's tough

146
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,969
when you don't when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this on</font>

147
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,380
volunteer time so it's been searching

148
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:33,909
for someone to help as an executive

149
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,349
director really lead this around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

150
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:41,469
globe and have frankly come up empty

151
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:44,530
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sock recently launched a</font>

152
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:47,139
program called directs 360 or slot I on

153
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:49,150
io n which is internet online which have

154
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:51,009
funds to help projects exactly like this

155
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:52,539
and are willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> dedicate resources to</font>

156
00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:56,319
go around to drive this kind of project

157
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:58,830
to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> better the global Internet so</font>

158
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,669
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had some recent success with that</font>

159
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,169
so one of the things that i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

160
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:04,500
show you is a presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> i gave last</font>

161
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:08,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">week in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ljubljana Slovenia</font>

162
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,960
and in it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a two-part conference 11</font>

163
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,349
part was go<font color="#CCCCCC"> sick Slovenia and the other</font>

164
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,460
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> was I six direct</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 360 ion and so</font>

165
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,140
you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they travel around the</font>

166
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,460
globe and they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> all kinds of edges of</font>

167
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:21,930
operator interest so with that I'll give

168
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,370
you the presentation that I gave last

169
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,350
week and this was entirely about

170
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:27,540
consolidating best of her current

171
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,030
operational practices and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font>

172
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,830
that I did this is that I heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

173
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:35,309
these efforts in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ripe region related</font>

174
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:37,169
to write 501 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a and a further effort</font>

175
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:38,429
and interest from people because they

176
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:41,270
love the standards they wanted to

177
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:44,130
increase the content depth and width

178
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:46,530
which evolved into a ripe document.write

179
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,030
554 and I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are several</font>

180
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,589
people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in doing</font>

181
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,990
very similar things but have the same

182
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,280
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did in this region which is</font>

183
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,650
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get these documents to</font>

184
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,490
survive and be current independent of

185
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:01,620
being power pointed an archived so I

186
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,780
give this presentation certainly already

187
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,970
went over what's a beat cop we talked in

188
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,560
detail about this problem about how this

189
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,780
is spread across all these meetings all

190
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,640
these operator groups and in fact you

191
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,170
know I heard maybe 20 or 30 different

192
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,880
operator groups i had never<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard of in</font>

193
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,740
things like Eastern Europe where people

194
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,780
don't get out to centralize large

195
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,060
meetings and they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this same problem</font>

196
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">right there looking for content in very</font>

197
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:27,319
small regions and it's hard for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to</font>

198
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,610
afford to get to things like a men on

199
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:35,730
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of things are extremely useful</font>

200
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:37,830
to them certainly sources of information

201
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,120
very you can get them<font color="#E5E5E5"> from colleagues</font>

202
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,230
you get them from pound I actually get

203
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">them from mailing list you asked</font>

204
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,580
questions all over the place so this

205
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,080
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gets really big when you</font>

206
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:48,420
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at the the globe as a</font>

207
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,830
whole and looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the operator</font>

208
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,699
lists and all the formats for having

209
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:55,470
this kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dialogue when I brought</font>

210
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,500
this up the first time the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for</font>

211
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">the existence of the bc o P program was</font>

212
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,160
a few of us had a conversation and tried

213
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,069
to get some support inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the air in</font>

region both<font color="#E5E5E5"> at nanigen at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin and it</font>

215
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,060
was very clear that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two d</font>

216

219
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,360
no desire to cross the lines of policy

220
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:21,290
nor impact

221
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,290
operational practice and in groups like

222
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:27,079
nanog nanog program committee caters to

223
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,550
its regular attendees so it does doesn't

224
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:30,589
always have content that's for things

225
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,839
like newcomers where someone says you

226
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:35,420
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brand new size 32 how</font>

227
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,620
do I sudden at this thing so it's

228
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,240
generally a little more technically

229
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,560
advanced in the idea behind these<font color="#E5E5E5"> bc o</font>

230
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,570
pieces that there can be anything from

231
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,899
really advanced to really simple but

232
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:47,450
still have base documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> i already</font>

233
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:48,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">talked about data being stale and the</font>

00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the name for those of you</font>

236
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,610
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF had a objection to the</font>

237
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:57,380
using bcp because it means something

238
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">very different from the ITF sper</font>

239
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:05,149
spective and the scope is focused on

240
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:06,680
operational impact so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

241
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:09,050
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I discovered in</font>

242
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,899
little tiny pockets of the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

243
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,699
are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create very similar</font>

244
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:15,980
efforts they all realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a</font>

245
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:19,070
pain but nobody's ever really launched a

246
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,420
program like this globally so it's great

247
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are a lot of people interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

248
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,599
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will have a</font>

249
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:24,829
lot of support going forward but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

250
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,180
also very challenging to get

251
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:33,079
coordination without some kind of

252
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:35,000
organization in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

253
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:38,329
so the solution is very simple right we

254
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,630
have effort consolidation we have an

255
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:44,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing bc o P development process that</font>

256
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,310
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> written by folks mostly in this</font>

257
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:48,649
region however the development process

258
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,750
itself allows for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> development</font>

259
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:52,880
process to be changed it is

260
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,829
community-based it is open so anybody

261
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,870
can go you know I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to suggest this</font>

262
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:59,149
document change and bring it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

263
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:02,720
community get it voted in vetted and the

264
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:05,839
document becomes modified so it's pretty

265
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,089
open as it is it was based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron</font>

266
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,930

267
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:13,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bottoms Up community-driven etc so it is</font>

268
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:18,229
very similar to that as you go through

269
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:21,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> website was created by</font>

271
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:26,089
is now a nice searchable repository and

272
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,099
hopefully we can get these regional

273
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:29,930
meetings to start feeding into the exact

274
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,520
same process so they can all live on

275
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,250
once

276
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,500
global development process that supports

277
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:39,940
the growth and continuing accuracy of

280
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,110
is generally speaking things get better

281
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,990
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean anything can get better</font>

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,959
problems in internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> Engineering is that</font>

288
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:07,449
we have a central place to say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

289
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:08,830
read this document just<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow it so</font>

290
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,160
what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> today I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just explained</font>

291
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:14,410
you know the vco PPD and it's based on

292
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron PDP which is why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I reference</font>

293
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,459
that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it is its own document</font>

294
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,890
so feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at that if you have</font>

295
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,780
suggestions to the process to change it

296
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:26,800
feel free to modify and submit to the

297
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:28,240
list people are reading them we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

298
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,680
getting feedback we are seeing that

299
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,960
people actually using documents and

300
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,609
asking questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about them sometimes</font>

301
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,960
they come in private forum sometimes it

302
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,460
comes to list but we've actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

303
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,380
some really good results from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this where</font>

304
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">people have said wow thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much I</font>

305
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">really needed this document I couldn't</font>

306
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:44,130
get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing done inside of my company</font>

307
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,089
without something to point<font color="#E5E5E5"> out saying</font>

308
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,740
you know these are subject matter

309
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,970
experts that are vetting this process

310
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're betting this whatever</font>

311
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,320
operational process and I was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

312
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my company to move forward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

313
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,480
had this so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really cool we're</font>

314
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:01,000
actually seeing some results<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also</font>

315
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,190
seeing a bunch of white a ripe working

316
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,050
groups pinup related to similar topics

317
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:09,250
so now we can consolidate those and all

318
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:11,530
get the same benefit so today they're

319
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:14,050
relatively few documents written that is

320
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:16,420
simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> a matter of it took a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

321
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,390
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this this track together and the</font>

322
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,680
idea working with a development process

323
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:23,500
but what we have today are the

324
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:27,550
development process itself a document on

325
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,950
I pbx by pv6 subnetting a document on

326
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,719
public peering exchange interface

327
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,450
standards so like when you're vetting up

328
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,800
here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Port at an IX what the config</font>

329
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,450
should look like across various

330
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,260
platforms and what to block and what to

331
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:43,649
accept etc document you'll hear today on

332
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,499
ipv6 peering in transit

333
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,930
and the right 554 document falls into

334
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:50,999
this category so as we consolidate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

335
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will fall into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these but it's</font>

336
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:55,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">really up to the community so this is</font>

337
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,519
entirely driven by people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room</font>

338
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:58,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">people around the globe with the same</font>

339
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:03,179
common interests of getting these things

340
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:06,059
done so you as an individual are welcome

341
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:08,129
to get up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask for a topic topic if</font>

342
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:10,050
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got documents in mind or you've</font>

343
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:12,480
started writing things or made similar

344
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:14,368
efforts either within your organization

345
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,259
or externally<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help people even</font>

346
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:19,170
partial documents are helpful to submit

347
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:25,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">that people can work on and we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> grow</font>

348
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:28,889
this so I proposed a handoff to I sock

349
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:31,679
when they created the deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> e360</font>

350
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:33,629
program and they accepted they offered

351
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,749
to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> people behind this but funding</font>

352
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:38,490
behind this and take this<font color="#E5E5E5"> over so last</font>

353
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:40,920
week you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they made a very public</font>

354
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,929
statement that more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than happy to give</font>

355
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,628
the rest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that effort and and there</font>

356
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:46,980
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a handoff process so i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

357
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:49,410
with a few parties over there to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

358
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen make that official and</font>

359
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:54,809
really grow this globally<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we</font>

360
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the right stakeholders identified</font>

361
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:59,759
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the majority</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR communities</font>

362
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:01,589
although there are a lot of them so

363
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,240
hopefully this will grow organically and

364
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:05,939
other stakeholders of interest in in

365
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,860
this general area and even smaller

366
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:09,748
communities will start to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved</font>

367
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:13,949
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could promote this even in the</font>

368
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:15,269
far reaches of the earth you know

369
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:17,040
certainly we want to be promoting

370
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:19,379
attendance and participation list

371
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,120
involvement bring this to regional

372
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,399
meetings similar tracks like this to

373
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,519
grow this very quickly not make it tight

374
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,990
or dependent on any particular region

375
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,399
and work together on our ratification

376
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,959
process that allows these kind of

377
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,620
changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be made on list and not</font>

378
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:37,498
require meetings like this today<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

379
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">mailing list actually sits on a personal</font>

380
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:43,319
server at my house so that needs to be

381
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:45,269
moved<font color="#CCCCCC"> the website</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is now on a vm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and is</font>

382
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:49,110
run by by i sock and a few volunteers

383
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:50,939
from the community and then we have a

384
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:53,759
few outstanding graphs that are in

385
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:57,349
progress to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented like chris is</font>

386
00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:00,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing for one of them today love the CDs</font>

387
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,600
at general meetings in operator forms to

388
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,200
attract more people into this<font color="#E5E5E5"> process as</font>

389
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,150
well so it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really cool to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see like</font>

390
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,370
the results and maybe you know a case

391
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:13,880
study what a document does and some

392
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:18,939
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-world results presented to</font>

393
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:21,230
help really promote this kind of driver

394
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:23,270
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just a question slide that</font>

395
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:26,810
was in in the presentation it's not

396
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:30,020
important here so with that being said

397
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:32,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to hand this off to mr.</font>

398
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:35,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">Grundmann to present an ipv6 peering and</font>

399
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:39,129
transit draft I actually have the PDF

400
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,129
yes you're all set

401
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,820
whoa that's just now

402
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:06,719
wow that text is you bet even see that

403
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:09,149
text is that too small well you yeah

404
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,510
okay you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk through this year</font>

405
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:18,809
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what a zoom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

406
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:22,010
maybe we can you just can see the front

407
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:22,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hear oh yeah</font>

408
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,760
so this document started as a

409
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,570
presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> at an ipv6 conference</font>

410
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,750
probably a little over a year ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

411
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:39,040
and then look like good fodder for a bc

412
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:41,080
o P so brought it to I think Phil nanog

413
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,399
in San Diego<font color="#E5E5E5"> and presented kind of a</font>

414
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,169
rough outline of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this might look</font>

415
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,940
like and since then<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the mailing</font>

416
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:50,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">list and then some offline conversations</font>

417
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,970
have fleshed it out and and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have what</font>

418
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,320
we have today so if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been on the</font>

419
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,120
mailing list at all I look like some of

420
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,720
you have you've already been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

421
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:05,129
read through<font color="#E5E5E5"> this document um and if not</font>

422
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,130
I can maybe

423
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:16,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">Thanks so in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusion here the</font>

424
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,350
format of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> B Cup basically goes</font>

425
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:19,389
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the details and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then at the</font>

426
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:21,519
end here the conclusion basically lists

427
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:23,678
again kind of that outline of what we're

428
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:27,279
saying in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> B cop in in very short</font>

429
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,259
terms so I'll look at this person what

430
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:33,789
we basically came up with here is the

431
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:36,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">first practice is to establish new ipv6</font>

432
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:39,759
only peering sessions parallel to the

433
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:41,168
existing active v4 peering which doesn't

434
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,690
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need a new physical connection</font>

435
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:45,309
it means you're connecting ipv6 type of

436
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,919
v6 and ipv4 word acted before so

437
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,809
basically don't exchange the ipv6

438
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">network layer reach ability information</font>

439
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:54,249
over an existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> active</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before appearing</font>

440
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:56,559
session which<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

441
00:19:54,249 --> 00:19:58,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">that a lot of people seem as an</font>

442
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,820
attractive<font color="#E5E5E5"> option to just add actively</font>

443
00:19:58,509 --> 00:20:03,460
six of their existing peering its<font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font>

444
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:06,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">term it's a really bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a number</font>

445
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:09,159
of reasons and so that's the first bc o

446
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:11,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">p here is to set up the ipv6 technology</font>

447
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:15,549
as a parallel<font color="#E5E5E5"> but independent peering</font>

448
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,629
session right and then to step back a

449
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,918
second before i go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the filtering</font>

450
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:20,529
stuff one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying to</font>

451
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,600
do here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this isn't brand new</font>

452
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:24,700
rocket science if you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP these</font>

453
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,610
bc o<font color="#CCCCCC"> pisa probably sound fairly common</font>

454
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,690
sense to you and fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyday but</font>

455
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,428
what we really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is make sure</font>

456
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,129
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know by begin by producing</font>

457
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:35,619
these beasts eops would ipv6 we have a

458
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:36,998
chance to possibly educate folks on

459
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:39,820
doing this the right way from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

460
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:41,470
beginning so instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> having the mess</font>

461
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,299
that we have a type of before we can

462
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,379
have decent established I previous

463
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:45,580
experience sessions that actually work

464
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:48,549
the way they should and filter the way

465
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,799
they should and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we you know maybe</font>

466
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:52,658
someday turn off before or at least to

467
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,179
start using v6 more will have a very

468
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:57,759
much smoother operating internet so the

469
00:20:55,179 --> 00:21:00,399
second bc o P is to filter right and

470
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,539
there's three categories they're spaced

471
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:03,998
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that lace these out pretty well</font>

472
00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:06,279
on in some information<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have on the</font>

473
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:09,159
website filter out coming in from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

474
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:10,720
customers first obviously then filter

475
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:12,309
routes coming from your peers and up

476
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,600
streams and then filter the routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

477
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:18,668
your advertising out and further up in

478
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bc o P itself there's quite a bit</font>

479
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:22,179
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail on you know what these rules</font>

480
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,559
actually look like and there's some

481
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:24,179
options here<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so some of this is</font>

482
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:26,460
not

483
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:28,769
cookie cutter some of his things you're

484
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,259
just going to have to do on your own

485
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:33,570
right but there's there's best practices

486
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:36,330
here for filtering from your<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers</font>

487
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:38,999
you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> want them to publish in a</font>

488
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,990
ir r or at least tell you the routes

489
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:42,840
they're using and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can filter</font>

490
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,429
specifically on those filtering from

491
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,779
your peers and transits again hopefully

492
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're using an IRR and you want to</font>

493
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:49,830
encourage them to but if they're not

494
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,320
there's still methods to<font color="#CCCCCC"> protect</font>

495
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,939
yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> from getting bad routes and</font>

496
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,470
then your own routes of course you can

497
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,429
do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best job there because you know</font>

498
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're supposed to be</font>

499
00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:00,419
advertising because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your routes to</font>

500
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:04,918
advertise and again using an IRR which

501
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:07,139
is the next part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the BTOP to use an</font>

502
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,700
error right register your<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes so that</font>

503
00:22:07,139 --> 00:22:11,219
others know how to filter you and can

504
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:15,419
filter you in a programmatic automatic

505
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,889
way and then I Pam the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

506
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,320
management becomes much more important

507
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:23,758
in ipv6 so that's the the fourth dcop

508
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:25,559
here to use IPM and it just basically

509
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,679
this document gives a description of

510
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:30,210
what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and how to use it the v6</font>

511
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,369
address space is obviously much much

512
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,139
much much larger than I could before and

513
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:35,759
so tracking individual subnets and

514
00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:38,039
addresses you're handing out within<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

515
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:41,279
own organization to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to update</font>

516
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:42,779
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> irr is quite important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

517
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,299
register and appearing to be if you want

518
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:46,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">to appear with people you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to let</font>

519
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:48,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">them know and one of the best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways to do</font>

520
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,470
that is to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> your information in the</font>

521
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:51,960
peering DB it's also a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> resource</font>

522
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:54,629
for other things when you need a contact

523
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,480
AG<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lupul contact it's a great place to</font>

524
00:22:54,629 --> 00:22:59,158
go so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the five bc</font>

525
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,100
o PS that we have in<font color="#E5E5E5"> here right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now for</font>

526
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,659
ipv6 purine and transit to some extent

527
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:07,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's its bgp peering not necessarily</font>

528
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:09,059
pure purine and the the final<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font>

529
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:13,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">hasn't made it and it was suggested off</font>

530
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:15,360
list was another practice around

531
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,610
performance monitoring right do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

532
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,309
to keep track of latency jitter those

533
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:23,639
kind of things with your peers you know

534
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">p NS la's practices around that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

535
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:27,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that because these documents are meant</font>

536
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,679
to be living documents we can ratify the

537
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,080
document as is i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

538
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,879
information here is accurate and the

539
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,710
fact that it may not be complete in that

540
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:38,289
aspect we can definitely rub this and

541
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:41,289
do another one<font color="#E5E5E5"> but having this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> publish I</font>

542
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:42,520
think is valuable so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at that</font>

543
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:44,320
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up to questions and</font>

544
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:52,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can dig in to the details of this if</font>

545
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:53,740
you haven't seen it before as needed you

546
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:56,889
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to take rest Joe provo</font>

549
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:03,730
on the mailing list right before the

550
00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:09,370
meeting we're both dave friedman and i

551
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:15,460
had some minor updates like<font color="#E5E5E5"> dave had</font>

552
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:19,350
specific references to certain resources

553
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:22,360
for referencing the filter contents and

554
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:26,139
the one that some people may think is

555
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:28,539
contentious I suggested to add a SNS in

556
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:31,059
addition to prefixes for the filters yes

557
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:34,870
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one thing I didn't point out</font>

558
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:38,918
this is versions 06 is what i'm calling

559
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:40,840
it of the BTOP version 0 dot dash<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 is</font>

560
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:42,760
the 1i<font color="#CCCCCC"> sent out to the mailing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list you</font>

561
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,139
know a few days ago so those comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

562
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,929
believe have been integrated I just

563
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:49,600
mailed this version out to the list 30

564
00:24:46,929 --> 00:24:50,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes ago so you can look and make</font>

565
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,090
sure that I've actually addressed your

566
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,679
concerns but i think all the concerns

567
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,090
were raised both on and off the bay and

568
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,549
let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got some emails that didn't</font>

569
00:24:55,090 --> 00:25:01,059
go to list as well other than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP for</font>

570
00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:02,590
performance practices I think everything

571
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:05,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">else was included the references</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

572
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:09,360
filter asn filtering and a couple of the

573
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:09,360
comments do receive off list as well

574
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:16,640
any other questions on the content of

575
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:19,530
this bc o P or concerns yeah in the back

576
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,540
yeah hi this is a guide Tala with white

577
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,100
white I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering if it would make</font>

578
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:27,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense to include something in there</font>

579
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:30,990
along how to use a dressing for you know

580
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:34,890
v6p and is like some people prefer to

581
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:37,830
use 64 some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer 127 s this and</font>

582
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:39,270
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so maybe if there was at least a</font>

583
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,580
document where if<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some</font>

584
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:45,559
contention between people setting that

585
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:47,760
up you could say well best practice is<font color="#CCCCCC"> x</font>

586
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:49,770
would that<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> include or</font>

587
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a great point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's</font>

588
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,799
probably something a conversation the

589
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,049
ponies we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure we have</font>

590
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,970
consensus on what the what the bc o P

591
00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:58,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be you know what it is there and</font>

592
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:00,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">if we can do that or at least come you</font>

593
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,860
know to what we've done in past musical

594
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,020
piece also is when there's something

595
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit contentious we put</font>

596
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,799
in what we think the bc o P is and then

597
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,450
you know add a note or an alert or some

598
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,530
kind of you know reference say hey you

599
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,240
know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people may do this slightly</font>

600
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,379
differently but we think it's one so we

601
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,530
can agree on it I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'd be great</font>

602
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to include maybe hopefully you know</font>

603
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:20,160
hopefully again in the next version but

604
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:25,320
I think that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good idea</font>

605
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:28,290
middle Mike we do a photo to telecom I'm

606
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:30,510
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> I find it hard to comment on the</font>

607
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:38,610
content because the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

608
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:41,400
really easily available well there is a

609
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:45,439
website which has a version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

610
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:50,190
document as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the way as for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

611
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:55,020
finalized policy development process

612
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:59,480
that is dated something like early<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

613
00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:02,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">locate something spring San Diego time</font>

614
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,910
getting getting comments getting

615
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:09,120
comments from a broader community like

616
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,650
someone was talking about well okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

617
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,250
should be a droid this should be

618
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:20,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">addressed and discussed and agreed with</font>

619
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:23,309
the other regional activities while okay

620
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,269
having to dig down into a mailing list

621
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:27,330
and he

622
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:29,609
up a word document is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> making things</font>

623
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:34,289
very easily available the document

624
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:37,769
versions that I did easily find look

625
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:40,859
like they require lots of work well okay

626
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:49,769
I I cannot judge I cannot judge how much

627
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:51,779
work has has happened in between I think

628
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:54,389
that's very fair I think moving forward

629
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:56,969
we definitely need to address a couple

630
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:58,649
of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> again it's kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sidetrack</font>

631
00:27:56,969 --> 00:28:01,739
outside the scope of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular vco</font>

632
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:05,158
p is a mailing list the best way to do

633
00:28:01,739 --> 00:28:08,309
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know how do we do that we</font>

634
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:11,669
really really reach global consensus on

635
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:12,959
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> VC LPS and that I definitely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree</font>

636
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:16,259
that's an ongoing question that needs to

637
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:17,219
be answered and yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're not on</font>

638
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:19,440
the mailing list you haven't seen the

639
00:28:17,219 --> 00:28:21,329
recent versions of this so I understand

640
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">the diversion from San Diego</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is simply</font>

641
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:28,769
an outline so obviously much work needed

642
00:28:22,979 --> 00:28:29,969
to be done at that point still I don't

643
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:31,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how to address that today for this</font>

644
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:34,349
vco p other than maybe I mean what we

645
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:36,109
can do is we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> always wait not call</font>

646
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:39,979
it a bc o P yet leave it in draft form

647
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:42,539
and address that issue of you know

648
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:43,469
whether it's a wiki or we've talked

649
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:47,809
about me and we went through some other

650
00:28:43,469 --> 00:28:50,479
ideas we tossed around some things and

651
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:53,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">for expediency sake to kind of get some</font>

652
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:58,799
things done initially<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did the mailing</font>

653
00:28:53,219 --> 00:29:02,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">list well okay maybe you missed the</font>

654
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:05,820
specific suggestion that I made that was

655
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:08,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">well okay get the current document on</font>

656
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">the website</font>

657
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:15,730
we can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

658
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:30,379
any other questions or comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

period transit bc o<font color="#E5E5E5"> P it's Wilson Lee</font>

660
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:35,149
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bell just want to know them what</font>

661
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the public exchange environment do</font>

662
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:40,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">you tie that to the pup exchange draft</font>

663
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:43,279
that they proposed regarding like

664
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:45,590
neighbor discovery and multicast on the

665
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,720
ipv6 soil you just leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it separate</font>

666
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:50,149
it's less separate for now this draft

667
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,250
doesn't address that at all it lets the

668
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:54,289
other bc o P speak to those concerns and

669
00:29:52,250 --> 00:30:16,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is specifically about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP peering</font>

670
00:29:54,289 --> 00:30:21,410
practices cool thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

671
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:23,360
thanks Chris so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds like this</font>

672
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:27,320
probably we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just leave it in in</font>

673
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:30,830
draft form and do a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

674
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:33,379
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process before rolling this one</font>

675
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,909
forward which is totally fine more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

676
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,290
happy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more involvement and</font>

677
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:38,330
certainly it's a very clear take away to

678
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:40,670
get current things up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the website</font>

679
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:43,310
right before the meeting there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

681
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:48,500
pretty active discussion and I think

682
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,150
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the development process</font>

683
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:54,710
itself should be modified to accommodate

684
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:57,680
a much larger audience and and and do

685
00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:01,610
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a dynamic nature rather than</font>

point well taken and please feel free by

688
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:07,879
the way to take the policy development

process and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes to it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:44,299
doing something around how to tell you

718
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:48,080
know operators how to announce their

719
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:50,450

722
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,150
worst as far as being able to announce

00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,570
all their routes out without<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to</font>

people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do it either for a</font>

733
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:28,789
itself has some mechanisms to allow them

734
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:31,730
to you know announce<font color="#E5E5E5"> their full route</font>

741
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:49,399
in South America we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you know</font>

742
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:51,200
we see the the net block and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

743
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:53,658
send it there but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they're</font>

744
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,730
they're killing the tables and you know

745
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:58,100
and they also make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult for</font>

746
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,809
you know transit providers were you know

747
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:02,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a previous life when i worked at one</font>

748
00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:04,100
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a customer who would only</font>

749
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:05,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">announce us some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their routes and so</font>

750
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,789
we were actually sending some traffic to

751
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,739
the customer via peering and it is very

752
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:11,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was thinking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

753
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:14,888
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing something that would sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

754

address how to how to do more sane

755
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:22,540
traffic like<font color="#E5E5E5"> round announcement and so</font>

756
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:24,469
if if there's any sort of you know

757
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:26,300
consensus around yeah that might be a

758
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:29,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">good idea or now just leave them alone</font>

759
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:33,020
just let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sink</font>

760
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:35,960
some time into kind of efforts so no

761
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:38,780
there have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been no efforts in the lac</font>

00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">neck region mild efforts in the AP neck</font>

763
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:44,770
region no efforts in a frenetic region

764
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,190
to date but welcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody who is going</font>

765
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:49,719
to those regions people like yourself to

766
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,040
to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to them I think we can put</font>

767
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:53,348
together a reasonable set of guidelines

768
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,779
and documents and some presentations to

769
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:57,490
help get more involvement I don't

770
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly know how to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:02,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-language issue but again open to</font>

772
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:04,210
suggestions this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> community driven</font>

773
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:06,690
program and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> often very challenging</font>

774
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:09,730
to do things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a global scale</font>

775
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:12,040
welcome the input so the input I got

776
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:13,930
while I was down<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

777
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,839
more than happy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take on most of the</font>

778
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,730
work of doing translation etc so it

779
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:20,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds like as you transition into a</font>

780
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:23,079
more formal process with<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sock support</font>

781
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:24,848
etc it'll be good to coordinate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

782
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,950
some folks to take on<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of that</font>

783
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:29,829
effort so that it can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done by the</font>

784
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:32,379
communities that actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that'd</font>

785
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:34,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">be awesome if you could forward context</font>

786
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,760
and I could put all of you together that

787
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,290
would be great so just as a point in

788
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,260
that we've kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of started that so</font>

789
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:42,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">Arturo servant from lack Nick they've</font>

790
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,079
got what they're calling the best

791
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:45,640
practices development process they kind

792
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,559
of started their own thing in parallel

793
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,790
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've reached out to them they've</font>

794
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:52,630
reached out to us a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit they've</font>

795
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:54,430
talked about trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their list hasn't</font>

796
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,780
been very<font color="#E5E5E5"> active and they have only had</font>

797
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:57,819
like the one meeting to kind of kick it

798
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,109
off but they're talking about taking our

799
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:00,520
existing documents translating them into

800
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:02,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Spanish and Portuguese and seeing what</font>

801
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,900
makes sense going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward so that has</font>

802
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:05,950
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of started I think once I sock</font>

803
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:10,200
provide some funding and we get more

804
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:13,720
concrete that should happen awesome hi

805
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:16,419
my name is say<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Kamara from I</font>

actually chair of the Japan network

807
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:21,819
operators group I can't know about the

808
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,549
suffered and I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool</font>

809
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:29,020
I've translated ripe documents into

810
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:30,220
local Japanese language before and since

811
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,790
I didn't know about this and I know but

812
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:35,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's today I'll go and email our John</font>

813
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:37,779
arc list about this and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it</font>

814
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,940
generates interest and there's not

815
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,799
there's not a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> English speakers in</font>

816
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,940
Japan<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there are people that can</font>

817
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:47,770
translate maybe I can ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for volunteers</font>

818
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:49,840
made that will spread<font color="#E5E5E5"> the word in Asia</font>

Pacific region place to Japan

820
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:55,390
that would be fantastic and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds</font>

821
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,740
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of transitioned on its</font>

822
00:36:55,390 --> 00:37:00,850
own but the only thing left on the

823
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:05,640
agenda is really open mic so again this

824
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:05,640
is this is your meeting so feel free

825
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:17,799
otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're kind of a very short</font>

826
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:20,800
track and then early exit iron this is

827
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,170
vishal met annoying after the nanog in

828
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">san diego i had had some interactions</font>

829
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:29,290
with you about putting together a bc<font color="#CCCCCC"> o p</font>

830
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:31,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">on network management areas that we be</font>

831
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:33,250
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last few nanos we started</font>

832
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:35,110
with config management and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that man on</font>

833
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:36,940
and some very interesting discussions

834
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:38,230
came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean they are not they are</font>

835
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,670
not comprehensive they may not cover

836
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,260
everything but you know some of the

837
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:43,690
operators shared some excellent best

838
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,280
practices that they had been<font color="#CCCCCC"> using that</font>

839
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:46,990
could serve as guides to many of the

840
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,480
emerging operators and perhaps even

841
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:52,629
other operators that could learn from

842
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:55,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">the experience of the ones that were on</font>

843
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:56,650
the panel and you know we didn't get

844
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">very far with that discussion so maybe I</font>

845
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,520
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up now and see is that</font>

846
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:06,430
an area<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes sense to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write the</font>

847
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:09,850
opinion of the room anybody have any

848
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:11,710
comments on man I mean my personal

849
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:13,480
opinion is that's that's exactly the

850
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:15,430
idea anything that is internet

851
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,260
engineering related that is the best

852
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:18,790
current operational practice the idea of

853
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,730
centralizing that making it searchable

854
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:26,410
and keeping it current is is exactly the

855
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:28,810
intent of this kind of forum medium so I

856
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:30,759
would fully support that kind of thing

857
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,350
yes if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we if we put a stake in the</font>

858
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,290
ground just as a starting point

859
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:37,240
summarized what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> shared in that panel</font>

860
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:39,490
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a few pages of</font>

861
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,290
information and then let people throw

862
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,959
darts at it would that get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

863
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,950
interesting discussion started network

864
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,330
management seems to be something

865
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:49,149
everybody is looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially</font>

866
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:50,560
nowadays so it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good to do great</font>

867
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,300
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem down you know config</font>

868
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,270
management performance management etc

869
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:58,010
and then start putting information there

870
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:59,300
are you volunteering to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that or you</font>

871
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:02,210
asking me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find someone to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help you</font>

872
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,620
know I'm partly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm trying to do</font>

873
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:07,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm trying to see that anybody</font>

874
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:13,549
else will join the effort would anybody

875
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:15,770
volunteer to join that effort don't try

876
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:19,790
that at home you got one volunteer up

877
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:24,350
front<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay who's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe I can sync</font>

878
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:27,200
up with him later could you tell your

879
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:28,310
name stand up it's it's mike smith<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

880

881
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:38,320
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great sync up often after the</font>

882
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:38,320
session okay open mind anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

883
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,820
Chris gone again um just to kind of

884
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:47,150
point out for the rooms I think some

885
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:49,580
several folks were<font color="#E5E5E5"> are new and maybe</font>

886
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,690
haven't seen the process actually yet I

887
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,460
think Aaron did a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job of</font>

888
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:54,410
explaining it but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

889
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,430
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not looking necessarily for</font>

890
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,870
volunteers I mean that's obviously the

891
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,129
best thing but<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you just have a</font>

892
00:39:56,870 --> 00:40:00,920
question right basically the way the

893
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:03,980
process works is we get a area to focus

894
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,750
on and a shepherd does need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to volunteer</font>

895
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to kind of drive the process but they</font>

896
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:09,170
don't necessarily have to write the

897
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,570
whole document their job is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to collect</font>

898
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:13,670
information from subject matter experts

899
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:15,500
on that topic and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then create this</font>

900
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,660
document kind of in conglomerate so it

901
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,640
doesn't end up being too hard of a

902
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,080
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he likes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

903
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:23,000
first thing is finding those questions

904
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:25,160
right so there's a lot of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

905
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,110
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us might think of is as you know</font>

906
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,629
second nature or<font color="#E5E5E5"> as just daily tasks</font>

907
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:31,460
that a new engineer has questions about

908
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">and wants to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do that how's</font>

909
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,280
the best what's the best way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

910
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:36,380
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> even just collecting a list of</font>

911
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,560
those questions but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you remember</font>

912
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,940
asking or that you get asked a lot is

913
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,920
really valuable and then we can start

914
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,480
finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> Shepherds to take on those</font>

915
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,550
projects who can then go on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and find</font>

916
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,550
sneeze and you know get these documents

917
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:51,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">turned out yeah I think that's a very</font>

918
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:53,330
good point and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try and put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together</font>

919
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:54,620
a more generic deck for anybody who

920
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:58,370
wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to present this and I'll make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

921
00:40:54,620 --> 00:41:00,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">to include a summary of the development</font>

922
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:04,330
process so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys can do whatever</font>

923
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:06,589
you'd like to it wherever you're going

924
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:09,720
yes sir

925
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:12,690
hey man hey it's matt<font color="#CCCCCC"> peterson</font>

926
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,149
independent member of nanog in the

927
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:17,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">DevOps community which I sometimes have</font>

928
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:20,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">been sucked into that's loosely defined</font>

929
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,750
as sort of operations systems

930
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,310
administrators and network engineers who

931
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,110
have taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> a more development mindset</font>

932
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:26,880
one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been successful at</font>

933
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:28,800
collaborating together with is using

934
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,510
things like github so the idea is that

935
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,760
you basically have a document<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

936
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:34,530
living document that anyone can modify

937
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,510
and I they can fork and make changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

938
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:39,240
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they can see diffs it's all built</font>

939
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:41,210
in the more most successful probably

940
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,470
movement is either the hop school or

941
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:46,710
something called monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> socks and</font>

942
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:48,180
they talk pretty much about very similar

943
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:50,220
things but more sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> UNIX system</font>

944
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:52,020
focused so my recommendation would be is

945
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,689
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put your documents in some sort of</font>

946
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:56,759
version control system that's agnostic

947
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:58,530
which is probably not Microsoft Word I

948
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,180
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would address some of the</font>

949
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:03,330
issues the gentleman from<font color="#CCCCCC"> deutsche had</font>

950
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,859
mentioned that we could see diffs and we

951
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:06,420
can see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current version it's</font>

952
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,070
automatically tagged I'd be more

953
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in participating if I didn't</font>

954
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:14,700
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use word for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

955
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:17,430
wholeheartedly agree I you know again

956
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the short history is that that the</font>

957
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:21,000
development process was intended to be

958
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,550
community driven so I really didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

959
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,800
to try and push anybody in a particular

960
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:27,690
direction and we had a rather long

961
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,660
dialogue in a first couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of meetings</font>

962
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:32,070
about how to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this done and there</font>

963
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,220
were suggestions all the way from

964
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:37,320
exactly that sort of svn style check in

965
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:42,089
check out<font color="#E5E5E5"> showed ifs very easily manage</font>

966
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:45,990
it all the way to sort of a web 20 kind

967
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:48,870
of take comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> and thumbs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up thumbs</font>

968
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:51,450
down vote of whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you think</font>

969
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:56,660
something's relevant and relevant enough

970
00:42:51,450 --> 00:43:02,129
to be vetted document control processes

971
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:05,940
as you well know are a pain so if you're

972
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:08,220
willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help define that please do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:21,480
yes feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> free if you want to you know</font>

977
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:23,160
suggested on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list write a quick you</font>

978
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:25,920
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to do this it's not that</font>

979
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,839

980
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,609
myself to some extent by forcing anybody

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,759
into it and I'm just trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

982
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:35,190
create an environment to let<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

983
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,660
drive exactly those kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of changes so</font>

984
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:38,579
if you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spending a little bit</font>

985
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,839
of effort helping drive that I think

986
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:42,390
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be extremely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable</font>

987
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:47,630
and help it certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow in a much</font>
