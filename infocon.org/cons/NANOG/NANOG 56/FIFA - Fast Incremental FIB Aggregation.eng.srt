35
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:09,090
as you can see the rid of Carruth of the

37
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:16,670

38
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:21,240
from the rib so that that makes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FIP</font>

39
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:26,369
very big and the large fib then may not

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,530
the first look up and the forwarding

the hardware or the line card or for the

46
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,860
rotor so we proposed a fib irrigation

47
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:52,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is a local glucose and the</font>

49
00:02:52,440 --> 00:03:03,810
sighs so why local low cost is important

50
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,910
because ice PS are reluctant to deploy

51
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:10,950
solutions with the high cost and with a

52
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:14,190

66
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:56,880

67
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:01,980
itself but the update handling because

68
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:05,730
we have to apply all those updates to

69
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:09,840
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aqua defib but meanwhile maintained</font>

a very good complaint ratio so the

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,798
opportunity was in our work first of

72
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,940
course is extended line hard our

objective is five<font color="#E5E5E5"> years at least and</font>

74
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:26,480
also we want to reduce the overall

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:30,859
updated handling time and

76
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:39,380
the total number 15 g's also the food

77
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:43,250

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:02,240
verified they have one hundred percent

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:07,310
forwarding the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me behaviors</font>

85
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:10,730
before and after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the aggregation so so</font>

86
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:14,030
we propose the FIFA model first let's

87
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:17,330
see the normal operation the operation

88
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:20,419
in a in a rotor so as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see if</font>

89
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,430
there are any road changes we will be

90
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,770
downloaded<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the fever located on a</font>

91
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:28,700
la carte directly and we designed this

92
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:31,580
album we plugged by module between<font color="#E5E5E5"> rip</font>

93
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,010
and a fib and in the control plane so if

94
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,919
there any<font color="#CCCCCC"> world change right now the</font>

95
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:39,380
first will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be handled by the FIFA module</font>

96
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,990
and then the fever module does to

97
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:50,330
download the effective ones into the

98
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:52,870

1999 using a binary tree and it needs

104
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:15,320
three passes over the binary tree to get

00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:35,060
using patria chart which is a space

111
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:37,610
optimized try and we only use two passes

112
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:41,379
to finish the same task

113
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:46,430
as the original of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RTC does and</font>

right now is 2.5 come faster and it's

115
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:55,159
only takes forty four percent of the

each update it always keep the smallest

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,990
websites and an old reallocation and for

00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:26,719
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tea Party is the mean more time</font>

127
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:29,029
added a deal Henry algorithm so this

128
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,889
emblem is the fattest one but things

129
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:32,960
more and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these are coming in the</font>

130
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:34,610
fifth sides may not maintain the optimal

131
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,400
one so we have to set a threshold for

132
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:42,830
this one so this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a reallocation</font>

133
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:46,250
and similarly<font color="#CCCCCC"> for FP aah this is a</font>

hybrid hybrid<font color="#E5E5E5"> abid handling album so in</font>

135
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:55,279
this album we pick the two features from

<font color="#CCCCCC">SNT and there's no reallocation and it</font>

has small small fee besides 3po changes

138
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:07,870
so first let me roughly go through the

139
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:11,830
or RTC implementation just give you a

140
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:16,599
big future how we did the application

141
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:19,490
first as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our left table</font>

00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:24,169
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the original</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fib entries so we</font>

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:27,710
load those entries into a binary tree<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

145
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:34,779
use three passes so the first pass is a

00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:43,190
top-down process to normalize all the

147
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:46,370
other leaf nodes and so each normalized

148
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:50,329
node will get the sim desktop as the

149
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,260
same as is the nearest ancestors so like

150
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:58,219
this

151
00:08:51,260 --> 00:09:04,900
and the second pass is a bottom-up post

152
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:08,300
order process too much nest hops so for

153
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:10,010
so ever that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you each each know</font>

154
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:15,859
that we have to maintain a set of

155
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:18,439
finesse hops so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

156
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:21,920
us and the third pass for what you see

157
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:28,060
is to select the nest hub from the root

158
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,060
of the tree it is a top-down process so

159
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:38,270
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the three passes we only</font>

160
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:43,550
pick the effective knows that is true in

161
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:47,120
the corrinos so they will be loaded onto

162
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:51,670
the equifit and actually it has the same

163
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,670
forwarding behavior as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> original one</font>

164
00:09:52,270 --> 00:10:00,290
so I roughly good went through the

165
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:04,310
application and let me introduce the

166
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:07,579
update hun dream so first the update

167
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:11,170
hunting without any aggregation for

168
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:13,730
example I will have a new purpose

169
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:17,839
announcement coming in 141 dog to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

170
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:20,720
file / 18 with<font color="#E5E5E5"> ness top three and if you</font>

171
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:25,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a in a pile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a tree actually one</font>

172
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:28,420
node will be generated<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this the</font>

173
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,280
prefix will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> downloaded into the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fib</font>

174
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:36,439
so as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> relationship</font>

175
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:38,079
between one rib<font color="#E5E5E5"> update and the one the</font>

176
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,950
fifth change is one to<font color="#CCCCCC"> one relationship</font>

177
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:45,710
so one rib update 1 15 or 1<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fan</font>

178
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">keynote but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we apply the same update</font>

179
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:51,950
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drip it has a different</font>

180
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:56,030
story so that means one rib update may

181
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:58,730
trigger multiple 15 days or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

182
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:03,100
multiple nodes will be get affected<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

183
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:06,570
will use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> f is FIFA s</font>

184
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:09,880
update honey as an example so the left

185
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:13,650
the lab toiletry is the aggregate of

186
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:17,020
people as shown in previous slides and

187
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:22,000
so right now we are update we<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply the</font>

188
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:23,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">art Steve update to this try and this</font>

189
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,860
this album will keep the global

190
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:30,490
optimality so multiple nodes will be

191
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:34,650
getting pelted in this example for level

192
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:38,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">three nodes will get a felted fh energy</font>

193
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:41,530
but only the effective 1g actually

194
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:45,580
finally will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> downloaded into the fit</font>

195
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:49,810
everything so it has the same forwarding

196
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:57,340
behavior as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the original update update</font>

197
00:11:49,810 --> 00:12:01,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">one so 40 and the age they have the</font>

198
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:04,840
similar properties so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just give it but</font>

199
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,810
i won't give you a straightforward

200
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:11,050
example to show the differences between

201
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:15,250
the three of them so finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got one</font>

202
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:19,689
that is a ir spring example so for

203
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:23,440
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have i have a fever Adam and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

204
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:25,720
have already knows spring so the

205
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,240
original spirit represents the

206
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,890
alternative<font color="#CCCCCC"> size so for the first step</font>

207
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:36,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">we apply the improved or RTC to the</font>

208
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:40,140
original fib and we go to the optimal or

209
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:43,290
smallest tip size and for each update

210
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:47,080
each atom after the other words are the

211
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:49,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">updates the results for each update and</font>

212
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:54,450
as you can see for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to update the</font>

213
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:59,740
favor always keep the smallest websites

214
00:12:54,450 --> 00:13:01,720
so let's see FIFA Chi so at the very

215
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,620
beginning we have the same original fib

216
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,990
size and things more and more this is

217
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,820
this album will keep a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look of the</font>

218
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:13,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">melody so we're more and more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

219
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:16,930
are coming in we the free besides will

220
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,210
be go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be going back to</font>

221
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:22,689
original<font color="#CCCCCC"> fib</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sighs so we have to set a</font>

222
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:24,910
threshold to control the fifth<font color="#CCCCCC"> size but</font>

223
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:31,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first step is the same we need to</font>

224
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:34,270
apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same algorithm improve RTC and</font>

225
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:36,790
so when more and more updates are coming

226
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:39,480
in and create the flip side will get

227
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:42,610
loose and until<font color="#E5E5E5"> a threshold is reached</font>

228
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:46,750
so what's the threshold reached the

229
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:49,380
threshold can be can be a I mean a

230
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:52,060
memory a memory limit you have a your

231
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,220
memory image and you can state that were

232
00:13:52,060 --> 00:14:00,130
held for that and what's the threshold

233
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:02,830
reached the algorithm will push the egg

234
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:05,800
with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this web sites back to the</font>

235
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:09,310
optimal using reallocation notice that

236
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:13,630
each relegation only requires a point

237
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:19,060
two seconds and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth this</font>

238
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:23,410
the reaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> will down periodically so</font>

239
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:25,479
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifa h before the threshold is</font>

240
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:30,069
reached it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same operations as</font>

241
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:33,430
FIFA t but you know in order to avoid

242
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:35,980
the rear vision instead helpful pushing

243
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:39,189
the fifth sides back to the optimal the

244
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:42,690
smallest tip size we we just the album

245
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:45,130
just push it under the threshold and

246
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:49,230
when more and more updates are coming in

247
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:55,000
the album the fifth sides will go back

248
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:58,089
about about the third hole so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> hope to</font>

249
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,770
the push again so on and so forth but no

250
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:04,959
radiation so so right now you may get a

251
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:10,000
big picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the differences of the</font>

252
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:12,130
three evidence so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk talk</font>

253
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,170
about our evolution evaluation

254
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:21,490
methodology and the evaluation results

255
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:24,630
so first our data were from the road

256
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:28,690
view project rip debo and updates from

257
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:30,430
january first 2011 to December 31st 2011

258
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,680
and

259
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:37,930
use this pure because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fear has the</font>

260
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:41,290
most es hops so generally the more s the

261
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:44,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">Martin s hops number the more difficult</font>

262
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:46,660
to do the aggregation so that's also

263
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:49,810
indicates that we are estimating the

264
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,779
worst case so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did Stan Mikita</font>

265
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:56,109
pre-processing we filter after all the

266
00:15:52,779 --> 00:16:01,300
wicked update messages and into that in

267
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:07,260
the end of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 other year they are about</font>

268
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:11,770
50 for immediate updates and we use the

269
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:15,880
nest es hub as in the nest hall so we

270
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:18,880
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> the experiment our normal desktop we</font>

271
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,589
use for<font color="#E5E5E5"> metrics to do the evaluation the</font>

272
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,060
most important and student for line is

273
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:27,279
the fifth size the total number of

274
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:29,859
entries in the aggregate fib the second

275
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,170
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the time cost the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tutor now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

276

top of the total update handling time

277
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:38,439
and the third one is the total<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

278
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:41,770
50s as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned before well Reba</font>

279
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,959
updates may not admit cost multiple 15

280
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:49,540
days so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the total number of 15</font>

281
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:53,640
days and also reversed so we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

282
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:59,439
a distribution of for example how many

283
00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:03,939
rip up this cost zero this value can be

284
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:08,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero since some people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this may be a</font>

285
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:11,350
duplicate or covered so how many

286
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:15,339
relationship is 120 how many is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 121 how</font>

287
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:18,819
many s went to 10 some level so I'll go

288
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:22,119
through them one by one first the fifth

289
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:23,589
sighs so the top red line represents the

290
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,839
original<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifth sides without any</font>

291
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:32,590
irrigation<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see in the end of</font>

292
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:37,230
2011 they are about 300 8005 entries and

293
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:41,980
the the red line at the bottom is the

294
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:43,390
results for FIFA s so you can see in n.o

295
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:49,000
to tell evan is

296
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:51,910
it's about 150,000 so about more than

297
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:01,690
sixty percent people any treat have been

298
00:17:51,910 --> 00:18:04,930
aggregated and so for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fib FIFA T and</font>

299
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:10,450
H we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set a threshold we set a</font>

300
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:13,510
threshold as 180,000 so the blue line

301
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:16,690
represents the results for FIFA<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chi as</font>

302
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:19,770
you can see it will periodically to the

303
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:23,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the reallocation and there were</font>

304
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:24,850
93 allegations in 2011 and the each

305
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:30,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">irrigation is about point two seconds</font>

306
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:32,500
and that the black line is the FIFA H

307
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,990
does so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see before the</font>

308
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:38,140
thresholded reached it has simply it has

309
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:40,750
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifth size as the FIFA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chi but</font>

310
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,580
once the threshold is reached so it will

311
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:47,460
the flip side will still around the

312
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:52,600
threshold and then no recognition so

313
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:56,130
overall the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aggregation can engage more</font>

314
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:00,310
than fifty percent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people entries</font>

315
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:03,190
so that the second Matrix is the time so

316
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:06,639
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom black line represents the</font>

317
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:10,570

00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:20,860
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tea party results is a part 1 point2</font>

327
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:45,280

330
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:54,000
number updates without any obligation so

331
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,300
it's one to one relationship right so

332
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,240
one change product

333
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:04,290
so for the tea party<font color="#E5E5E5"> with us is about</font>

334
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:07,320
1.1 change / update and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FIFA H is by</font>

00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:11,010
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one point to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 days / update so</font>

336
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:14,730
even for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimum one is about 1.8</font>

337
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:18,900
second provident so from the last you

338
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:24,960
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see they are all accessible so the</font>

00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:29,340
last one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the free burst so first from</font>

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:32,520
the category of<font color="#CCCCCC"> less than or equal to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">one category you can see most rib</font>

343
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:50,280
about 99% of the rib updates<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost less</font>

344
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:55,530

346
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:07,790
that in FIFA s and H the heavies<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

347
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">worst is about 500 and the 1115 TS</font>

349
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:19,830
fever's your early very small but it

350
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:25,500
could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very large because that</font>

351
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:32,429
reallocation so you can pick the one

352
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:37,310
feel for you so summary from fee besides

353
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:43,410
you can see FIFA s is the best from the

354
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:48,889
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs fifa cheese best from the FIB</font>

355
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:52,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 days fifa cheese best and from the</font>

356
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:57,150
feeblest a fever ass is best and from

357
00:21:52,710 --> 00:22:00,720
the revolution prospective FIFA s and H

358
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:05,370
are the best so there's no silver bullet

359
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:08,010
right so what's the benefit our

360
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:10,060
conclusion is that we can stand around

361
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:12,420
her life or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lionheart left</font>

362
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:17,560
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than five years up to seven years</font>

363
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:19,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we use the history data to get this</font>

364
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:23,860
conclusion for example remember in the

365
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:29,470
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> total 11 the optimal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fifth size is</font>

366
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:34,419
about 150 so if we map this results to

367
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:38,140
the history<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trent of the fifth size we</font>

368
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:42,460
are back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 2005 so even we are using</font>

369
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:45,040
the third hole one tnh actually we are

370
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:49,150
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> two thousand six so that that</font>

371
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:51,639
means if we if one rotor or like Harlan

372
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,410
were supposed to be replaced in two

373
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:59,530
thousand five or six can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> till</font>

374
00:22:53,410 --> 00:23:01,750
now so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the operational impact so</font>

375
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:05,020
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course you need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maintain the</font>

376
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:09,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">aggregate fit in main memory I mean in a</font>

377
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:11,440
control plane and for you to edit them

378
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:15,940
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay the corresponding time</font>

379
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:22,180
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> clip changes and reversed as I my</font>

380
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:25,870
analysis before so the conclusion from

381
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:28,420
benefits<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually we can extend the</font>

382
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:32,770
rotors lifetime for more than five years

383
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:37,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they have smaller head from the time</font>

384
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:41,440
15 days and the cost is that I mean the

385
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:46,630
cost is 440 updates I mean the feedback

386
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:49,180
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam is not only hours you need</font>

387
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:53,110
attention additional memory in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

388
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:58,390
control plane and you need to hand out a

389
00:23:53,110 --> 00:24:02,850
few bursts so these some references

390
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:06,250
including some our previous work and

391
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:10,120
this work was supported by s current and

392
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:13,000
we also thank want to thank professor

395
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:26,960
are interested in my research or

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:30,379
you think I may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be one of you all I mean</font>

402
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:48,320
jeff has juniper networks for your

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:51,289
aggregation statistics are your next

404

408
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,269
suggest that your statistics are a

00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:14,149
little optimistic given that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank</font>

410
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:15,080
you another question microphones are so

411
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:20,268
up and we have some minutes for

412
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:26,269
questions come every Latino fog<font color="#CCCCCC"> touch</font>

413
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:32,659
telecom looking at your evaluation of

414
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:40,000
your gain I'm missing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

415
00:25:32,659 --> 00:25:43,759
caveats about well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how the</font>

416
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,389
estimated gains may be off from what's

417
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:51,379
going to be experienced first of all

418
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:53,689
voila cage the question is quite

419
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:59,019
obviously you are assuming there are no

420
00:25:53,690 --> 00:26:02,029
ibgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules in a forwarding table actree</font>

421
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:06,889
when prefix corresponding one that's hot

422
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:10,659
so if it doesn't matter I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

423
00:26:06,889 --> 00:26:15,139
BTW peeled well I have I have I have a

424
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:17,509
significant percentage of my roots that

425
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:21,469
I'm that that I have to feed into the

426
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:26,259
FIB that are actually internal ibgp and

427
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:30,679
never will show up in route views and

428
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:34,759
very likely are not being aggregate able

429
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:37,070
in good ways that's that's

430
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:43,249
that's probably that's probably taking

431
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:46,519
away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the estimate of how much how</font>

432
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:50,359
much you can gain the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing of</font>

433
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:59,929
course is at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> the caveat should be</font>

434
00:26:50,359 --> 00:27:03,968
in place that well okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you did you</font>

435
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:12,109
did an estimation well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

436
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:16,849
evaluated your gain from a signal from a

437
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:22,099
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopes I think I desktop yeah no</font>

438
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:27,619
no no no no a snapshot of the routing

439
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:30,799
table I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example well maybe did</font>

440
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:33,349
the evaluation first we pick up pick the

441
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:37,459
rotten people in at the very beginning

442
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:39,859
of 2011 and then we get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

443
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:42,739
updates of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we</font>

444
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:48,649
apply all these updates to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people so</font>

445
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:51,259
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a square shot you saw that show</font>

446
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:56,559
you so you ran the aggregation from on

447
00:27:51,259 --> 00:28:02,359
the table of 2005 and of this of today

448
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:06,408
for us no I mean I picked the table for

449
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:09,259
example january first 2011 and that is

450
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:11,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ok people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we apply all these</font>

451
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:14,809
updates afterwards and because the

452
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:18,129
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the whole year yes so kind of</font>

453
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:21,499
kind of the assumption that the

454
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:25,519
aggregation well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the ability to</font>

455
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:29,359
aggregate you are projecting from today

456
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:32,479
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next five or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seven years yeah</font>

457
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:35,869
that probably should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be worth</font>

458
00:28:32,479 --> 00:28:39,319
a caveat because well<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok the way how</font>

459
00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:43,939
addresses are split and being aggregate

460
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:46,290
about today is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure to be the</font>

461
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:49,160
same in five years time

462
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:51,899
okay yeah that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> point actually</font>

463
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:56,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah another work with either the</font>

464
00:28:51,900 --> 00:29:00,780
evaluation from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2000 Wi-Fi I'm a right</font>

465
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:04,890
to 2010 with we found that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

466
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:06,600
application ratio is better and better I

467
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:09,990
mean we can add with more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more I</font>

468
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:16,159
think due to learn more and more more

469
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:16,160
specific perfect in a table thank you

470
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:23,400
any other questions actually I have a

471
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:25,350
quick question um d you Michael Sinatra

473
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:29,730

474
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:31,230
any kind of router like a like some sort

475
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:33,870
of open flow routes herb or anything
