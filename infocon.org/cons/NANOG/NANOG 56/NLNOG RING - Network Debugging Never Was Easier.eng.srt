simplifies them in December 2010 a

34
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,990
friend of mine had some IP related

35
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,149
issues a random collection of source IP

layer to internet exchange just did it

39
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,860
work and he asked his friends can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

43
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:20,049
I am the orange guy and he would phone

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:22,450
people email<font color="#E5E5E5"> them talk to them on IRC</font>

45
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:25,569
and ask for pink sweeps or trace routes

46
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:28,720
and he would get data back often without

47
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:33,099
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> time stamp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and all in all it took him</font>

53
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:51,910
debug networks it can take a lot of time

54
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:54,459
to gather enough data so wouldn't it be

55
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,319
much much easier if the guy that had

56
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:57,940
this problem could just log<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to</font>

different<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks surrounding the</font>

58
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:04,209
exchange and run all these tests himself

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,640
and not bother with asking people

60
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:09,909
because he has direct access this is how

61
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,069
the ring started we can organizations

62
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:14,319
gave each other shell access to machines

63
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:17,409
and from that moment on those

64
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,380
organizations could debug layer to load

65
00:03:17,409 --> 00:03:24,459
balancing issues like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> much much</font>

66
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:28,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">easier we started with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 organizations</font>

67
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:30,879
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has grown quite a lot now we're</font>

68
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:35,620
in 33 countries and there are over 140

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:37,739
150 boxes around the world as you can

70

<font color="#E5E5E5">see Europe is heavily represented</font>

71
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:46,959
America could use a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more but</font>

72
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:49,510
this has grown to to a very big

73
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,250

76
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,419
we look at participants we see

us to your customers on both sides if we

88
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:38,940
look at a simple example of what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

89
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:42,960
when you join<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ring in this example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

90
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:45,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">log into the note that my organization</font>

91
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,820
has provided to the ring and I can issue

92
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,130
a command that is called ring ping the

93
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:54,390
ring ping command logs into every note

94
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:56,219
and execute an ICMP ping and gives back

95
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,520
the results and aggregates this nicely

96
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:03,300
for you I've done the test both on ipv4

97
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,539
and ipv6 and it's not worthy to see that

98
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,000
on average there is a slight difference

99
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,260
between the v4 and v6 latency it's

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,990
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

101
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,730
presentation to dig in why that is but

102
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:19,470
as an operator this might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> of interest</font>

103
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:24,450
to you and might motivate you to get met

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,520
you see that a kite 01 cannot reach it

109
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,940
but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's a fee 6 only</font>

110

result hole 01 I can just log into that

112
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,979
note now run a trace route we're in this

black holes for unknown reasons but with

118
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:07,919
these two commands I can very quickly

119
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:13,020
zoom in and see where an issue might be

120

<font color="#E5E5E5">and email the relevant parties other CLI</font>

149
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,330
that if the web interface sucks or we

150
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:43,919
provide shitty service we can point at

151
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:46,440
the bad i label the web interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

152
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,318
concept behind it is that on every ring

00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">node a demon runs and this demon does</font>

154

155
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:58,650

156
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:01,110
records<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet loss and it tries to</font>

157
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,560
gather as much metrics as possible and

158
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:06,060
store these in a central location and

159
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,979
that central location is our web

160
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,150
interface through which you can dig so

161
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:15,508
let's dive into that this is a matrix

162
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:18,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">with on the left side all us ring notes</font>

163
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:22,050
and on the top side again the same us

164
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:26,580
ring notes and then you have a mesh with

165

the any to any<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv4 packet loss hey you</font>

download<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides afterwards if you</font>

170
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:42,449
deviating from what was recorded in the

you almost everything is green except

00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:40,010
of the cells are colored yellow this is

190
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:43,490
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have 20 bytes less compared</font>

191
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:46,490
to the 1500 MTU standard so this means

192
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:49,970
they're tunneling or using transitional

193
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:52,040
technologies that eat up MTU for you as

194
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,200
a network operator overviews like this

connecting through tunnels their web

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:13,459
interface also allows you to really zoom

201
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:16,160
in on network issues you might have for

202
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:19,760
instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> if i click on certain targets I</font>

203
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:23,089
can get historical graphs with on the

this case jitter towards one specific

206
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:33,350
target graft over time you see a small

207
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:35,569
red<font color="#E5E5E5"> dots there and we can zoom in on</font>

208
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:39,380
that red dot and see what was going on

209
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:41,900
at that time if we zoom in we can have

210
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,300
graphs<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this similar to what smoke</font>

211
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,839
pinged us except there is no smoke in

212
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:51,979
this graph and it maps out jitter packet

213
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,380
loss and latency and indeed at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4am this</font>

214
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:57,950
morning there<font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed to be some kind of</font>

215
00:10:54,380 --> 00:11:02,240
problem between<font color="#CCCCCC"> softlayer 05</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and netflix</font>

216
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:05,350
01 we can also view trade routes from

217
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,920
that particular point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in time</font>

218
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:12,730
and we see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 4am the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> traceroute</font>

219
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:15,280

220
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,950
minutes later so maybe there were there

221
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:23,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">was some backbone issue or cable got cut</font>

222
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:25,060
I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the ring provides you</font>

223
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,980
with a possibility that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

227

back in time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and troubleshoot</font>

228
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,310
what was going on at that particular

229
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,050
time now you can confirm what's the

230
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,359
customer right because you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ring</font>

231
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,400
as your neutral point of view and you

232
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">can also see puffs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taken at that</font>

233
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:51,040
particular time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this web interface</font>

234
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:53,110
works for both v4 and v6 we believe in

235
00:11:51,040 --> 00:12:00,099
feature parity between the address

236
00:11:53,110 --> 00:12:02,860
families the ring is governed by a rough

237
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,530
consensus process so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a mailing</font>

238
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">list and people can voice their opinions</font>

239
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:11,680
and based on that input we decide our

240
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:14,020
direction aside from that there are four

241
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,959
ring administrators and they just do the

242
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:21,000
technical hands-on work they install new

243
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:25,030
notes they provision new user keys and

244
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,530
troubleshoot if needed they perform the

245
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,569
software upgrades do the security

246
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,430
maintenance so although the management

247
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:33,940
of a ring note lies with these four

248
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:35,589
people we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very active</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> community</font>

249
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,170
that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have for instance amp</font>

250
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:40,720
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and energy is</font>

251
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:43,800
being spent on writing cool tools that

252
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,780
make common task easier to execute and

253
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,780
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ring as a community effort</font>

254
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:52,270
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is built by us network operators and</font>

255
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,550
for us as network operators it's here to

256
00:12:52,270 --> 00:13:00,790
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain routing to the main</font>

257
00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:04,719
troubleshooting easier joining is very

258
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:07,990
simple it's free<font color="#CCCCCC"> I use the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> word practice</font>

259
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,950
because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also works in Dutch all you</font>

260
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:13,840
need is a single machine this can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

261
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,870
virtual machine as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has a</font>

262
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,030
64-bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU you are required to give it</font>

263
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:22,390
at least one IP four and one

264
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:24,459
v6 address and you need to have those

265
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:27,340
addresses in the default free zone with

266
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:31,030
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> autonomous system so this project</font>

267
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:33,550
is for network operators you can fill in

268
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:35,770
an application on ring dot and<font color="#CCCCCC"> l nett</font>

269
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:39,819
there's a huge ugly button you can't

270
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:42,550
miss it and ring notes you should

271
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,980
consider them as a regular colocation

272
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:48,579
customer or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> regular customer behind a</font>

273
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:51,370
DSL line so in terms of security just

274
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:57,070
treated as any normal customer and

275
00:13:51,370 --> 00:14:00,340
you'll be fine this concludes my short

276
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:08,080
presentation on the ring I'm curious are

277
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:09,430
there any questions Scott librarian

278
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,320
limelight networks what's the security

279
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:15,219
model how do you prevent me from pinged

280
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:17,560
a chef<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like I believe that</font>

281
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:19,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can run ping de chef much more</font>

282
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,199
efficient if you go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russian</font>

283
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:25,510
business Network so so your model is I

284
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,970
love scale too big sorry so your model

285
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:30,640
is don't scale too big Oh as I mentioned

286
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:33,040
am I one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my first slides the the it's</font>

287
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,380
built on trust we've been running now

288
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,290
for two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> personally believe in a</font>

289
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:40,240
name and shape if anybody ever abuses

290
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,310
the ring and that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not help you so</font>

participants can access ring notes and

295
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,630
we we do accounting but it's so far in

296
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:58,630
two years time there has not been a

297
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,880
single case<font color="#E5E5E5"> of abuse so that that gives</font>

me<font color="#CCCCCC"> hope that we can continue in this</font>

299
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:10,060
direction for the future are there any

300
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:14,469
other questions I have one do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

301
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:16,060
any idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much it's used how much do</font>

302
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,810
the participants actually use the

303
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,939
service around<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world we we do</font>

304
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:27,520
have some statistics I don't know them

305
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:30,780
from the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my head but i'd say it's</font>

306
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,939
used a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few hundred times per month</font>

307
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,800
yeah it's hard to measure because for

308
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,530
instance we bring ping you do an ssh

309
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,920
login to every note so if you execute

310
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:44,800
that single man you have 150 ssh login

311
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,199
so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers add up quickly well the</font>

312
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,380
ring is very actively used by a lot of

313
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,930

314
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:55,060
commonly cited uses of the ring is to

local fault at your<font color="#E5E5E5"> site somewhere have</font>
