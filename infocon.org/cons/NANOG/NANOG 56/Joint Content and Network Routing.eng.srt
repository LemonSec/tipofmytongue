on our research on how we try to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgb</font>

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,170

call joined network and content routing

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,559
so to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some context our initial</font>

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,260
approach was to try to optimize

11
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,669
performance for the common online

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,500
services we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have today which are the</font>

usual<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspects we have a google search</font>

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,969

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,129
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the terms of number of users</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

16
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,469
they have and growing and in pretty

17
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,230
competitive environments this is one

18
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,910
that stuff like Layton sees at which you

19
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,209
deliver content to your users<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

20
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,548
matters so to optimize this content

21
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,760
delivery to users focus on through port

22
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:11,280
latency or jitter there are two typical

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,130
ways content providers might do this the

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,259
first is network routing where you try

25
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,270
to find better alternate routes to your

26
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,740
customers and the second is content

27
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,960
routing but you try to push your content

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,210
closer to yourselves so we use these

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,280
terms network and content routing so let

30
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,280
me first<font color="#E5E5E5"> define what exactly we mean by</font>

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,710
them so network routing is something

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,689
everyone here is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with the</font>

33
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,579
problem is essentially one of evaluating

34
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,279
are using better routes to content to

35
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,979
file available and this is typically

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,479
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP traffic engineering so here</font>

37
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:47,009
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> should also clarify by network routes</font>

38
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,990
I mean a hop of ASPCA SS or is peace so

39
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,729
as the diagram shows on a crude level

40
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,589
you have clients or a set of prefixes on

41
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,780
one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anna content providers POV and</font>

42
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,360
the other and you have various alternate

43
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,899
paths and you use traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering</font>

44
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,219
methods to decide which set of a SS or

45
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,729
ice piece you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to send you traffic</font>

46
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,169
through and there are typical methods

47
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:09,060
for this and long term you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

48
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,370
find<font color="#CCCCCC"> ups or better upstream connection</font>

49
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,530
or try to set up a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> P or P in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

50
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,670
short term you have the standard

51
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,990
local prayer for selective route

52
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:21,000
announcement techniques and various

53
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:22,170
others so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is content routing so the</font>

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,600
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is a little different</font>

55
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,000
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single content provider you</font>

56
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,549
now have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same content replicated or</font>

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,190
available at multiple locations which is

58
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,069
with what we call replicas and the

59
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,470
problem now is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of directing every</font>

60
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,380
client to the replica<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is most ideal</font>

61
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,760
to it perhaps the replica<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has the</font>

62
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,340
least latency for the client or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

63
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,940
replica that's but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs lease for</font>

64
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">the content provider and this is what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

65
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,100
call global traffic management or<font color="#CCCCCC"> gdm so</font>

66
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,530
as a diagram shows you have a client

67
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:59,100
requests coming in and you have a GTM

68
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,750
system that would be implemented through

69
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,470
various methods probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

70
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,970
DNS or through HDTV redirects and this

71
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">system of this interconnect somehow</font>

72
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,350
decides which replica is ideal to this

73
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:14,340
line and redirects that request to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

74
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:16,560
set replica so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this done typical</font>

75
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,420
redirect methods are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS to</font>

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,850
redirect a client<font color="#E5E5E5"> request or something</font>

77
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's geographically closer to it HTTP</font>

78
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,350
redirect for most<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher form or higher</font>

79
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:27,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">level applications and the factors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

80
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,850
you redirect based on our stuff like

81
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,589
latency and throughput or how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> load</font>

82
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,329
your servers are facing or how much cost

83
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,780
takes to actually handle a request at a

84
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:39,299
particular server so let's consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

85
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,400
typical scenario you have three replicas

86
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:43,680
replica AC and the one in black which is

87
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,989
eventually the chosen replica you have a

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">client or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a set of prefixes that making</font>

89
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:52,859
a request going to a GTM system so

90
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:55,230
typically how this GTM system or a load

91
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:57,060
balancer works is that it redirects some

92
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,500
small portion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client requests to</font>

93
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,690
each of these replicas and value its

94
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,640
performance and depending on which<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

95
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,799
these performance results are the best

96
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,910
it's going to redirect the client to the

97
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,790
choice at replica which is the one in

98
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">black now network operators presumably</font>

99
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,170
at that choice and replicas are going to

100
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,720
be seeing this incoming heavy traffic of

101
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:19,649
through this certain prefix and now

102
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:23,070
their job is one of optimizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

103
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:25,799
routes for this heavy<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic but there</font>

104
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,219
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a potential problem here the reality</font>

105
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,330
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks something</font>

106
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,490
like that so you actually have multiple

107
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,520
routes to each of these replicas but the

108
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,050
GTM system actually only sees the

109
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,140
current route which is what we call the

110
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:44,020
default route and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the ones the</font>

111
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,990
blue routes highlighted in bold so since

112
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,969
a GTM is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> service level application or</font>

113
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,040
an application level service it's only

114
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to see the most the routes that</font>

115
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,430
are up being optimized already weather

116
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,290
network providers so all measurements

117
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">are all redirects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and evaluations that</font>

118
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:01,090
is performed are over the single route

119
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,310
and network routing or traffic

120
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:06,039
engineering happens at a stage below

121
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,450
this GTM system wherein you see this

122
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,840
traffic in coming and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

123
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,940
choose between optimal routes so what if

124
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,679
this a better choice that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> G team</font>

127

that for that particular set of prefixes

130
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,179
so there might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a overall better</font>

135
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,239
the problem is can we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> better on one</font>

capabilities of what we call network

149
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:11,380
routing to this higher level gdm service

150
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,740
so our solution is what we call joint

151
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:17,350
routing so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left hand shows what the</font>

152
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,120
realities which is you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> GTM</font>

153
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,590
interconnect with a number of replicas

154
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,210
with each having a number of routes

155
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,469
going to it and the roots<font color="#E5E5E5"> in bold are</font>

156
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,130
the ones that a GTM system eventually

157
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:28,960
cease instead we use an abstraction so

158
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:32,290
at replica a you have two<font color="#CCCCCC"> routes going</font>

159
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,840
through it route 102 let's provide the

160
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,240
GTM system a notion of virtual replicas

161
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,119
which are actually combinations of

162
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,870
replicas and routes so what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

163
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,650
do is give the

164
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,610
gdm system a view of replicas a1 and a2

165
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,799
which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the same physical</font>

166
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,590
replica but a one is replica a with<font color="#CCCCCC"> root</font>

167
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,570
1 and a 2 is replica a with root 2 so

168
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,929
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 this is the view that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

169
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:58,690
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give the application level sirs</font>

170
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:02,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">and this interconnect is our joint</font>

171
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:06,910
content and network routing system so

172
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:09,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">using virtual replicas the method that</font>

173
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,830
we use is first of all do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> brute-force</font>

174
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">exhaustive search where we enumerate all</font>

175
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:17,590
possible network<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes at all possible</font>

176
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:19,210
replicas evaluate performance of various

177
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,909
client prefixes over each of these

178
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,400
routes and then we use existing GTA

179
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,590
methods like DNS or HTTP redirect to

180
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,080
select between<font color="#E5E5E5"> these virtual replicas</font>

181
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:31,210
instead and we call this joint<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

182
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:35,380
these steps are performed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single</font>

183
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:39,400
system so our goal when we started out

184
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:42,550
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok you can do this what gains does</font>

185
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:45,609
is offer so to do this we established a

186
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:48,190
test bed and actually evaluated or what

187
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">can be done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this so our setup looks</font>

188
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,610
something like this we have five

189
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,290
replicas which are simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> five servers</font>

190
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:57,100
in various universities around the

191
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:58,720
country and for clients we used an open

192
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,730
testbed called planetlab with nodes

193
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,440
around the world although<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are a</font>

194
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,140
larger percentage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these nodes are in</font>

195
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,500
the US and it reached replica we

196
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,840
evaluate around 250 alternate routes to

197
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,090
each of these prefixes so as a diagram

198
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,099
shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have around 200 lines 250</font>

199
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:19,659
in 25 one for each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the replica routes</font>

200
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:22,450
and five replicas so how do we actually

201
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:24,670
explore these 250 different routes the

202
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:27,280
techniques that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are typically available</font>

203
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:29,140
are things like setting local

204
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,380
preferences or weights or tunnel egress

205
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:34,689
for egress route selection and stuff

206
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:38,679
like selective path announcements or

207
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:40,780
using community attributes community

208
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,520
appearing arrangements or a spa three

209
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,959
pending to affect from where traffic is

210
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,569
coming to you which is ingress route

00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,790
selection however our<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup does not</font>

212
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,580
permit using these iron let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain</font>

213
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:53,110
why so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what it looks like on one</font>

214
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have our clients which I which</font>

00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:58,619
out on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other end we have a replica</font>

217
00:08:55,929 --> 00:09:01,089
which sits within a research yes and

00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:03,579
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> research air speaks to the outside</font>

219
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:05,139
world using a university years now

220
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:08,109
because this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a research system and</font>

221
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:10,029
things are largely in flux attributes

222
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,189
like local preferences or weights are

223
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,809
ignored by the university is because it

224
00:09:12,189 --> 00:09:17,319
does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want the trouble of actually</font>

225
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:20,319
dealing with that flux so how does this

226
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:23,589
research is control<font color="#CCCCCC"> assn is peace</font>

between<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes since it does not appear</font>

229
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,799
directly we had to resort to using is

230
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:36,790
path poisoning and focusing only on in

231
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:38,319
grass roots so poisoning is typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

232
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,790
method of forcing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> route around a</font>

233
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:42,309
certain years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the example</font>

234
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,319
highlighted here is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,199
around three<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent for Jetta rate</font>

295
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:12,820
improved by around six percent over

296
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:14,590
content routing and looking at where

297
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,600
these improvements come from we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

298
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,550
see that joint routing gives marginal

299
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,280
improvement over content routing and by

300
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,319
marginal we really mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

301
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,560
incremental bump over content routing

302
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:29,290
that this graph highlights so the y-axis

303
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,359
numbers are off because the y-axis<font color="#E5E5E5"> on or</font>

304
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,209
the relative gain which means it's off

305
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,680
by a factor of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 but the important</font>

306
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:38,740
thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> note</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is that as we</font>

307
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,689
increase the number of replicas both

308
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,220
joint routing and content routing start

309
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,810
growing in benefits because you know how

310
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,690
more replicas to<font color="#CCCCCC"> route to choose from</font>

311
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:48,760
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this margin or this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> incremental bump</font>

312
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,550
does not really disappear so it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

313
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,890
stay as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you add replicas and where does</font>

314
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,010
improvement actually come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from out of</font>

315
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">200 clients we saw that seven percent of</font>

316
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,150
clients actually moved to a different

317
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,730
replica or most importantly a different

318
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:09,790
virtual replica which is a combination

319
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:11,860
of rutin replica again so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much chaos</font>

320
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,599
does this cause 200 clients five

321
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,910
replicas to a flea route seems like a

322
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,170
tremendously explosive amount so how

323
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:20,439
many poisons do we actually need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

324
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">announce we found that it's not as</font>

325
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,019
explosive as

326
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:26,660
things to be with around five poison

327
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:28,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">announcements at every replica of we get</font>

328
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,680
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixty percent of the maximum</font>

329
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:33,589
possible improvement around sixty

330
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,540
percent of that 3.7 incremental game

331
00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:38,449
with seven or eight poisoned

332
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,670
announcements of we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost the</font>

333
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:42,829
company 3.7 game so although these are

334
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:45,259
quite a few announcements it's not as

335
00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:48,949
explosive as the multiplicative number

336
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:50,899
would have you believe so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

337
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:52,399
summary<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the results uh we see some</font>

338
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:55,670
incremental gains over content routing

339
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,019
and with a relatively few number of

340
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">poisoned announcements we get around</font>

341
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:02,779
sixty percent of the maximum<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font>

342
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:04,550
improvement so what next these are the

343
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:07,399
questions that we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask na</font>

344
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:09,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">nóg first of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ours is clearly a</font>

345
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,230
research set up which is nowhere close

346
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,750
to the real world so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make this</font>

347
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:17,329
practical is something like this already

348
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">attempted or consider ability and work</font>

349
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:21,469
in the real world for example we see 250

350
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">roots</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because we use a s path poisoning</font>

351
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:26,329
what does typical route diversity<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

352
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:29,509
guys seen your networks while choosing

353
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:31,729
between ingress or egress routes yes

354
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:33,589
path poisoning for example is really not

355
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,350
the ideal way to do this what I

356
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:37,910
tentative methods are even<font color="#E5E5E5"> better what a</font>

357
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,769
more realistic test beds we could use

358
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,769
where we could get a better picture of

359
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:44,509
what happens in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world and</font>

360
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:47,449
finally when is joint routing actually

361
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,860
useful so we evaluate a joint routing we

362
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:51,589
found that an artist<font color="#CCCCCC"> badet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give some</font>

363
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,420
amount of incremental improvement what

364
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,970
use cases actually find this useful and

365
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,079
more importantly what do improvements

366
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,810
actually look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a real world</font>

367
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:05,870
setting<font color="#CCCCCC"> as joint routing actually worth</font>

368
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:07,189
it so these are our asks from nanog so

369
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,870
if you have answers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to any of these</font>

370
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:10,490
questions if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us why this</font>

371
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,439
would work or why this couldn't work or

372
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,639
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> better if you if you would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

373
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:15,680
give us a research test<font color="#CCCCCC"> bed where we can</font>

374
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,360
run experiments please do come talk to

375
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,239
me at the break or you can also<font color="#CCCCCC"> email us</font>

376
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,699
at any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things so if you have</font>

377
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,970
any questions or feedback for us I'd be

378
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:28,089
glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> to listen we have time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

379
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions</font>

380
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,399
hi I'm Patrick for mock my I know you

381
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,180
guys are getting bored<font color="#E5E5E5"> of me touch it</font>

382
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:42,460
moving on you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single stubble yes</font>

383
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,790
and you're poisoning something outbound

384
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:47,649
through a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of upstream a esas most</font>

385
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,529
networks are slightly more complex than

386
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:53,140
that so by first of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> why poisoning</font>

387
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:54,370
one path you've now removed a backup

388
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,980
path which is the reason most people

389
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,709
have multiple up strings second of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

390
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,899
you've optimized a single path from a

391
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:07,449
client to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a piece of content on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

392
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:09,010
network whereas the graph of all source

393
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,170
and destination points especially for a

394
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,470
transit network is far richer than this

395
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:16,149
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> your three-point-seven percent</font>

396
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,500
improvement on the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible case</font>

397
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:21,660
scenario where you have a stub network

398
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:25,300
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> two up streams seems like a low a</font>

399
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:29,560
very very low of<font color="#E5E5E5"> benefit for what could</font>

400
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:32,589
be a complex and massive disaster for

401
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,689
other things so your real-world question

402
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:36,130
I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer to that</font>

403
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,500
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though to be honest I do this for a</font>

404
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,290
living it doesn't sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's a good</font>

405
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,940
idea at least not for poisoning perhaps

406
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,279
for prepending you might have a

407
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,230
different case but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you run</font>

408
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,339
into things like people<font color="#E5E5E5"> may not want you</font>

409
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to prepend because their business</font>

410
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:52,209
relationships forcing it from transit<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

411
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:54,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">to transit be suddenly costs them more</font>

412
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:56,319
and so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are reasons why these kind</font>

413
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,209
of things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not done and that's one of</font>

414
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the main reasons that content writing</font>

415
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:03,099
tends not to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to influence the</font>

416
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:06,160
network there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really question</font>

417
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,839
that's just common thanks in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

418
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">is precisely the kind of comment that</font>

419
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:14,020
was looking for kind of feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

420
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:15,899
wanted so as I mentioned s path

421
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,040
poisoning is really not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best way so</font>

422
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:25,079
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better methods that</font>

423
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:25,079
would be perfect more questions

424
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:33,220
Michael Sinatra<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes net I guess my</font>

425
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:37,270
question is how close does this get us

426
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:39,670
to actually do in content centric

427
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:42,670
networking like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jacobson and people</font>

428
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:44,020
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are starting to do and should</font>

429
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:46,720
we be putting our efforts into that

430
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:50,230
instead of some hybrid solution like

431
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,520
this so can I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask you for the</font>

432
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,020
clarification of what you mean by

433
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,270
content sent ignoring I'm not very

434
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,860
familiar I'm specifically talking about

435
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,840
the work that Ben Jacobson<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I believe</font>

436
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:04,870
leashes involved in that also and a few

437
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:06,310
other people are doing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> ndn and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font>

438
