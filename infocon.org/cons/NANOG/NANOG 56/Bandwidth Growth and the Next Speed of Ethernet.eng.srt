1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:11,750
okay our next talks another timely one I

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,410
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of important because</font>

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:21,029
the role that we operators have in

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:23,250
providing the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of neat the statement</font>

5
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,650
of needs for bandwidth is very important

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,970
in the I Triple E and ethernet Alliance

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,250
I believe are both very interested in

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,900
that so we have a presenter from brocade

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,450
Scott Kip who's also involved with the

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,110
ethernet<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alliance and he's going to talk</font>

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,390
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next speed of ethernet all</font>

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,760
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you yeah and I also want to</font>

13
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,649
talk about bandwidth growth you know

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,550
everybody knows the bandwidth is growing

15
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,500
more users faster speeds what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font>

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,780
do is give you some rules of thumb some

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,719
ways to wrap your<font color="#CCCCCC"> head around these huge</font>

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,899
exponentially growing numbers and then

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,850
we'll go into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next speed of ethernet</font>

20
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,809
now how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many know what the next feet of</font>

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:06,210
ethernet is going to be alright so a new

22
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,950
crowd I was surprised because I got on a

23
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,070
plane the other day and the guy sitting

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,960
next to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me knew what it was he you know</font>

25
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,169
it was only a week before that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd met</font>

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,979
in Geneva and talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about going to 400</font>

27
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,869
gig as the next speed so he pretty much

28
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:27,119
have consensus on 400 gig being in the

29
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:35,600
next speed but first off I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to give</font>

30
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:35,600
a disclaimer didn't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

31
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:48,860
sorry little technical difficulty<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

32
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,840
there we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go so the views I'm expressing</font>

33
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,970
our my own views I can't represent the I

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,590
Triple E or even the ethernet<font color="#E5E5E5"> alliance</font>

35
00:01:52,970 --> 00:02:03,350
even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm the president the</font>

36
00:01:54,590 --> 00:02:05,150
organization so with that said just one

37
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,470
slide about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ethernet alliance I mean</font>

38
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,810
we're a global consortium of

39
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,150
stakeholders and the ethernet industry

40
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,740
and with respect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this group what we</font>

41
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,470
want to be as a funnel for you to give

42
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,300
us your input we can refine<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and then</font>

43
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,390
present it to the I Triple E to help us

44
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,400
decide when how to do the next speed how

45
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,649
quickly what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reach what kind of</font>

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,890
media to do it on and we'll go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

47
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,360
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> more detail after we helped develop</font>

48
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,880
the standards in the ethernet<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alliance</font>

49
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,520
we also test it this week we're having

50
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,989
the largest plugfest ever of over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20</font>

51
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,720
companies at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the University of New</font>

52
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:42,739
Hampshire interoperability<font color="#CCCCCC"> lab so we're</font>

53
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:47,750
testing all at 10g based e 40 gig and

54
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:50,390
data center bridging this week so first

55
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,950
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the new study that we</font>

56
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">just finished in the I Triple E about</font>

57
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:57,980
bandwidth growth how how fast is it

58
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,930
growing here's one summary slide and

59
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,910
what we found out is there's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

60
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:05,239
growths so we would row two lines on

61
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:07,700
here the line that's going fasters for

62
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,950
networking the aggregation traffic that

63
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're you guys deal with every day what</font>

64
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,329
we're seeing is that it's doubling every

65
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:16,280
18 months so that's one figure of Merit

66
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,820
then when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I prefer those relays every</font>

67
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,320
five years we see a factor of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten growth</font>

68
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,870
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years we see a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred times</font>

69
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:27,079
growth will give some examples of that

70
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,030
coming up<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but that's you know one</font>

71
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,730
figure of Merit that you can use or one

72
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,670
rule<font color="#CCCCCC"> of thumb there's a lot of variation</font>

73
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:37,760
within that but if you know we how we

74
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">went to from 10 gig the consensus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

75
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're going to go to a hundred gig</font>

76
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,160
what we found out is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

77
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,230
wanted especially the server industry

78
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,420
weren't growing at that same rate so

79
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,160
they wanted 40 gig and that's what's

80
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,630
represented by the lower line there

81
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,840
there you see a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times growth</font>

82
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,700
15 years so on the horizontal axis it's

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,430
on in five year increments on the

84
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">vertical axis its factors of 10 for</font>

85
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,130
bandwidth growth so you can see in the

86
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:09,630
network it's growing<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 times every five</font>

87
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:11,790
years in the server space we aren't

88
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">growing as fast it's doubling every two</font>

89
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,409
years more closer to maybe Moore's<font color="#CCCCCC"> law</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

90
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,110
think most people know that the network

91
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:24,090
bandwidth is growing faster than Moore's

92
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:29,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">law typically so if you had like 10 gig</font>

93
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:34,080
in your network in 2005 you have your in

94
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:36,059
2010 you just apply that by 10 so you're

95
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,250
up to a hunter gig if you keep on that

96
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,530
rate by 2015 you're going to be at a

97
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,870
terabit already through that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

98
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,630
aggregate traffic in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network so how</font>

99
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,520
fast of speeds do we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to get to</font>

100
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,770
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of aggregate bandwidth</font>

101
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,200
that's we've been studying this in this

102
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,180
report and so the report is released

103
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,010
here's information how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that</font>

104
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,840
there's a white paper it's got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

105
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,250
pictures for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so you don't have to</font>

106
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,590
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the time you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can scan through</font>

107
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,600
it but the final report i think the

108
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,280
fourth bullet down there you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go</font>

109
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,210
online it's readily<font color="#CCCCCC"> available for</font>

110
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,760
everybody here's one of the pictures

111
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:14,630
from it this is from Cisco's visual

112
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,400
networking index so it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

113
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,740
it's a database basically you can go on

114
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,630
the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> and find pull up all kinds</font>

115
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,180
information what we're seeing here is

116
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:29,280
the IP traffic is growing about thirty

117
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:31,670
two percent a year so if you follow the

118
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,950
green bars there that's your fixed

119
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:37,050
access your fixed line you know the old

120
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,960
ethernet cable into the laptop or server

121
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,730
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing over forty percent it's the</font>

122
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,590
majority of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bandwidth today and I'm</font>

123
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:46,350
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not growing it'll be forty</font>

124
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">six percent of the traffic in 2015 what</font>

125
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,590
we're seeing is the wireless

126
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,920
connectivity is growing faster than that

127
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,940
and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about match it in 2015 so</font>

128
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,430
you know once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your laptop</font>

129
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,080
wirelessly we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't run cables</font>

130
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,210
throughout this room right everything's

131
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,450
Wireless it's so much easier in your

132
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,950
home in a conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this what</font>

133
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,340
we're seeing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot faster</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gross of</font>

134
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,500
course

135
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,169
is in the iphones or you know

136
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,310
smartphones we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> 92% traffic</font>

137
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:16,979
growth a year for the track<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

138
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,600
smartphones or the mobile data so we're

139
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,659
saying it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very small sliver</font>

140
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,880
today just a couple percent but just by

141
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,710
2015 it'll be about eight percent and

142
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,169
it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue growing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

143
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,210
so really amazing the transformation

144
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:32,789
we've gone through you know just in the

145
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:35,070
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> few years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like five years ago</font>

146
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:37,710
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> few people had smartphones now</font>

147
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:42,719
almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody has some right at least</font>

148
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:44,520
techies like us so here's a slide that I

149
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">put together I did quite a few</font>

150
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,250
presentations for this on data center

151
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:52,169
growth so<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting at storage you know</font>

152
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,510
we entered the zettabyte area of million

153
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:57,150
terabytes and think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

154
00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:00,750
now about the size your cell phone you

155
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,849
can have a terabyte disk drive so you

156
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I have a backup drive that's about</font>

157
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:09,000
a terabyte so when the bigger company

158
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:11,340
you know EMC IBM in them put thousand of

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,560
these in a couple racks of storage you

160
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,780
got a petabyte of data right there so

161
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,280
the storage is becoming so cheap that

162
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,619
it's enabling a lot of these new

163
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,909
applications the computing power of

164
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,919
course is growing right with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

165
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,970
according to Moore's law we had our

166
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:28,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">first petaflop supercomputer in 2010</font>

167
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:31,560
individual servers now<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going into 10</font>

168
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,720
gigs of Io I have a lot of stats coming

169
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,599
up for you about how servers are going

170
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,639
to 10 gig now we're finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing that</font>

171
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:41,940
hockey stick growth that people are

172
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,229
expecting you know a decade ago and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

173
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,060
finally we have networking right we've

174
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:48,479
entered<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hundred gig era a couple</font>

175
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago an individual switches have</font>

176
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">Turbots of bandwidth within the chat</font>

177
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,560
with in a chassis we're seeing

178
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:58,710
individual switchblades having over

179
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,410
Terra bit of throughput<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so all those</font>

180
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,690
are coming coming together to create

181
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,550
this bandwidth explosion you know you

182
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,070
have increased storage you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

183
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,169
increased processing times the increased

184
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,630
bandwidth and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> BAM a big</font>

185
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:14,789
explosion like the fourth of<font color="#E5E5E5"> July on San</font>

186
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,890
Diego I don't know if you guys followed

187
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:18,740
that but they have a big fireworks

188
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:22,580
display in a

189
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:24,500
diego five locations in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bay there's</font>

190
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,258
a computer glitch that blew<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all off</font>

191
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,880
it's simultaneously the host whole show

192
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:31,430
that was supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last 18 minutes be</font>

193
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,370
all orchestrated blew up in 18 seconds

194
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:37,039
so just one big explosion<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we're</font>

195
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:41,380
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of condensation of data</font>

196
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:44,420
and throughput in our networks today so

197
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:46,939
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're trying to quantify so</font>

198
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,630
so looking a little bit closer at

199
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:53,959
storage here this is external storage

200
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:57,290
subsystems and in 2005 130 exabytes

201
00:08:53,959 --> 00:09:00,680
stole<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2010 we saw about that 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times</font>

202
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:03,770
growth so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we entered the zettabyte</font>

203
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,750
era so that's a thousand exabytes by

204
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,699
2015 we're not going to see quite as

205
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,830
much of that but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is physical</font>

206
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,170
data that gets stored or shipped every

207
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,430
year you know the network it's easy

208
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,229
because you're descending the way

209
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,969
sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bits over the wire this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

210
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,399
stored bits so it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite a bit</font>

211
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">different and what even it changes more</font>

212
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,540
than that is like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of files</font>

213
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,670
because we have all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people with</font>

214
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,939
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> digital cameras or you know 12</font>

215
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,500
megapixel 16 megapixel cameras taking

216
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,120
pictures everywhere they store them all

217
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,190
the time they send them to friends they

218
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,310
upload them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook they get backed</font>

219
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:40,850
up replicated this data<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just it's</font>

220
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:43,550
growing at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind-boggling pace and that</font>

221
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,160
shows how there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> this exponential</font>

222
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:50,959
growth when you look over like five-year

223
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,240
periods for servers themselves this is a

224
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,949
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling chart you see the red bars</font>

225
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,250
across there that's all you're one gig

226
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:00,140
servers now this is port ship so

227
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,260
individual servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have multiple</font>

228
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:05,120
ports so as we do server virtualization

229
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're getting more throughput through</font>

230
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,520
each server so so one server might have

231
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,620
four gigabit ethernet ports at some

232
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:16,100
point they get they come to a point

233
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:18,860
where well it's not easy to put six gig

234
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,649
ports on us on a server let's go to 110

235
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,450
gig or to 10 gig ports so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font>

236
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:25,070
transition we're seeing right now I mean

237
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,779
this is that from the ethernet

238
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,610
perspective this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the biggest</font>

239
00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:32,689
transition the industry is going through

240
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:34,970
is 10 gig server ports escalating

241
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:37,460
mean we expect it to out ship one gig

242
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:41,300
ports in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next couple of years this</font>

243
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,710
is from Crais<font color="#CCCCCC"> Han research here but</font>

244
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,750
think of how this ripples through the

245
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:47,660
network if you have 10 gig uplinks you

246
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,280
up links from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server the uplinks</font>

247
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,290
into the core of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network have to be</font>

248
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,030
even higher speed than that so that's

249
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:56,270
what's driving that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 gig the hunter</font>

250
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:58,339
gig in eventually 400 gig especially

251
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:03,670
when these servers get to 40 gigabit per

252
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:07,550
second so here's a study of the network

253
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:10,189
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some recent data that Martin</font>

254
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:13,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">pels of am-6 presented at an alliance</font>

255
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:16,550
panel at a in Amsterdam last month

256
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:20,240
so what he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> shown is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exponential</font>

257
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:25,699
growth of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> aggregate network in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

258
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:28,280
euro IXPs so if you look at 2006 we were

259
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:31,360
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 there were about one terabit per</font>

260
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,800
second so if you look five years<font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font>

261
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:38,480
2012 it looks like they will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

262
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,099
terabits per second so they just this is

263
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,950
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> updated chart from what's presented</font>

264
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,990
in the bandwidth assessment report so

265
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:46,670
you can go there and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is one</font>

266
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:50,090
year behind so this is the latest data

267
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:52,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">for you but what we're seeing then so 10</font>

268
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:54,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">times growth every five years and a</font>

269
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:59,000
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> times grew with every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font>

270
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:02,210
so if you go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> what 2006 you see</font>

271
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,260
it's under one terabit it's / they're

272
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:07,520
predicting 90 terabits and 2016 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

273
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,740
hundred percent so just think of that

274
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">what one percent of your data today or</font>

275
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,550
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data today will be one</font>

276
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,520
person of the traffic a decade from now

277
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:19,579
if you're growing at this rate of about

278
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,770
fifty eight percent compounded annual

279
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,690
growth rate so these are this

280
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:27,230
exponential growth that's just really

281
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:32,180
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hard to grasp doubling every 18</font>

282
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:34,250
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten times every five years you</font>

283
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,979
know when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> first came to I Triple E</font>

284
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:38,570
and this is am-6 has been one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

285
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,940
leaders of coming into the I Triple E

286
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,970
and showing us how much they're growing

287
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,030
so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> came in 2007 and said yeah we're</font>

288
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,660
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grow all these</font>

289
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:50,790
terabits and I was hesitant to believe

290
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,189
them actually but<font color="#CCCCCC"> here we are four years</font>

291
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,079
later and it's right on track of what

292
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:58,260
they were predicting<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

293
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:01,710
IXPs joining their network more users at

294
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:04,410
each ixb people logging on more hours

295
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:08,580
you know an aggregate it's this amazing

296
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:11,610
growth rate so we took a lot of this

297
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:14,100
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> just from all the end users what I</font>

298
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:16,590
wanted to do is consolidate it into will

299
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,410
give a bigger perspective and show what

300
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:23,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">variation there is so this chart just or</font>

301
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:26,160
just explains this chart<font color="#CCCCCC"> here so what we</font>

302
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,010
did was we<font color="#CCCCCC"> took a unity at unity all the</font>

303
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,339
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> was normalized to 2010 so 2010 you</font>

304
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:34,200
have a relative value of one where's

305
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,420
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> data going to be in 10 years from</font>

306
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,130
now or five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years from now how long is</font>

307
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:42,000
it going to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go up an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> order of</font>

308
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:44,700
magnitude of your bandwidth so if you

309
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,260
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top curve and Ibaka</font>

310
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,940
the New York Stock Exchange when he

311
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:53,610
worked there he he saw a cagar of 90

312
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,310
over ninety percent so that was doubling

313
00:13:53,610 --> 00:14:00,180
or going up an order<font color="#CCCCCC"> of magnitude every</font>

314
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:02,310
what three<font color="#CCCCCC"> or four years now if you</font>

315
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,650
follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the red dashed line intersects</font>

316
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:07,500
you know from unity to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very corner</font>

317
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:10,709
so in 2020 it's right at a hundred

318
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:14,430
terabits per second or a hundred if you

319
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:16,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">had a if you had 10 gig in your network</font>

320
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,380
in 2010 and you're on that growth rate

321
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:23,790
you're going to have a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig at</font>

322
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:25,500
2015<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a terabit at2020 now going down</font>

323
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,180
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lowest curve that's the IP</font>

324
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,460
traffic gets growing at<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty two</font>

325
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,310
percent so you see it doubles about

326
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,890
every eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> years and I'm sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes up</font>

327
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,939
an order<font color="#E5E5E5"> of magnitude every eight years</font>

328
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:38,340
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're growing about thirty two</font>

329
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,310
percent so so again a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of numbers</font>

330
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,870
sorry to hit you with all these but I

331
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:45,150
got more to come there's a lot more in

332
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,770
the spreadsheet but this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

333
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,810
the conclusion of that bandwidth

334
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:52,829
assessment report that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> download</font>

335
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:54,660
and check out for yourself so now on to

336
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:57,300
the next speed<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet this is a real</font>

337
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,649
hot topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the industry we always</font>

339
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:03,930
consolidate see the latest technology so

340
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,540
we'll show you why I'll show you why

341
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,099
it's 400 gig and not<font color="#CCCCCC"> turbid I know a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

342
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,230
of there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of publicity about</font>

343
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,730
turbid Ethernet but we just don't know

344
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,619
how to do it we're running to get into

345
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,059
the laws of<font color="#E5E5E5"> physics I shouldn't say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

346
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:17,699
we know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it it's just a matter</font>

347
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:20,009
of making a cost effective we need to

348
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:22,170
not you know we've sent people to the

349
00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:24,029
moon right just takes a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money to</font>

350
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,349
do that we could give you a<font color="#CCCCCC"> terabit</font>

351
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:27,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ethernet it's just going to be very</font>

352
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:30,389
expensive and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a</font>

353
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:32,420
repeat<font color="#E5E5E5"> like of what we've seen with 100g</font>

354
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:34,649
base lr4 where it's been real expensive

355
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,959
people see the price tag and they'll

356
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:39,269
they'll wait to buy it we need ethernet

357
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,138
has always been a low-cost networking

358
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:44,759
solution so we'll show you about that so

359
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:48,209
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> told you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the 10 gig servers</font>

360
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:51,509
growing here's some stats from crate and

361
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:53,128
research so on the left side you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the</font>

362
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:54,660
number of 10 gigs server ports and you

363
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:57,149
see it's been growing it actually

364
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,829
stalled a little bit right before 2011 I

365
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:00,749
think that's why because people were

366
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:03,479
waiting for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> romley server to come</font>

367
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:06,019
out and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> romney servers designed for</font>

368
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,879
10 gig and specifically for 10g<font color="#CCCCCC"> base-t</font>

369
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:10,829
so if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that growth in the</font>

370
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,569
last couple of quarters and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

371
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:15,989
break it down in the right side<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

372
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:17,759
graph that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10g</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> base t 10g base t has</font>

373
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:22,350
this hockey stick effect where it's

374
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,819
growing tremendously<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's this is you</font>

375
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,559
know the kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 get growth rates</font>

376
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:30,929
that really make that jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the curve</font>

377
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:33,629
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10g base t you know has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been very</font>

378
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:36,329
powerful before like high power like

379
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:38,220
consumes too much power to incorporate

380
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:41,248
into a server now with the latest

381
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,839
processes we it's under<font color="#E5E5E5"> control and so</font>

382
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:46,110
it's starting to be deployed quite a bit

383
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:49,769
so wrongly servers are being deployed

384
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:52,259
now have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10g base t capability a</font>

385
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:53,819
lot of other capabilities to that are

386
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:57,839
driving that but we're seeing really

387
00:16:53,819 --> 00:17:00,089
solid growth in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that 10 gig here's some</font>

388
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,369
stats on the terabits of traffic from

389
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:04,199
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> summer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> olympics through the i think</font>

390
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:09,839
the london internet exchange is more

391
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:12,270
charts for you here's a HSE consensus

392
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,179
call or I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> a consensus ad hoc</font>

393
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:17,099
where we're starting a new form in the I

394
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,500
Triple E so that we can discuss what the

395
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,849
next speed of Ethernet is so this is an

396
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,560
active group we would love to have

397
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:24,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">people like you come in and present to</font>

398
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,690
us saying why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need the next beat now</font>

399
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:31,590
100 gig isn't fast enough for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us give us</font>

400
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:35,550
more right so we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> a we did a survey</font>

401
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:38,399
last month in Geneva we did a straw poll

402
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:42,149
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> unanimous everybody wanted 400</font>

403
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,070
gig except one person was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stalwart</font>

404
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:47,700
wanted the rate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be selected later in</font>

405
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:49,649
the study group a terabit nobody know

406
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of Engineers we</font>

407
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,370
just didn't think it was practical<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

408
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,979
low-cost enough basically the group

409
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,409
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do 400 gig at a limited scope</font>

410
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,410
really quickly I'll go into more detail

411
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,210
on that we also came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to agreement that</font>

412
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:07,140
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the call for interest or</font>

413
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:09,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">cfi in march so it's coming coming quick</font>

414
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,670
it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a two year at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least a two</font>

415
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,800
year development cycle from that so 2015

416
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:16,080
2016 we should have a standard for that

417
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,930
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what objectives we decide</font>

418
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,360
so let's look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit so</font>

419
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:24,480
first let's consider the options how can

420
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,360
we go at 400 gig so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little recap of a</font>

421
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred gig is it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten from electrical</font>

422
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,770
interface it's ten lanes of 10 gigabits

423
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:33,330
per second right right now we're

424
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:36,150
defining the second generation and I

425
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:38,460
Triple E which is four lanes of 25 so

426
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,620
two and a half times power<font color="#E5E5E5"> or faster /</font>

427
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,020
lane we're looking at some advanced

428
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:46,080
modulation techniques but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks like</font>

429
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:50,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">it will continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be nrz or non return</font>

430
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:53,070
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero so just simple on-off keying so</font>

431
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:57,420
to go to 400 gig the prevailing thought

432
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:59,879
is that we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> do 16 lanes of 25</font>

433
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,170
gigs so just take four of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those lanes</font>

434
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to have in this new</font>

435
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:08,430
generation multiply it by 4 now you have

436
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:10,170
16 lanes of 25 gig we could also do<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

437
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:12,450
lanes of 40 gig but we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

438
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:15,240
standard for how to do 40 gigabit per

439
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:17,580
second yet or we could do eight lanes of

440
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,070
50 looks very promising as well I was in

441
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,710
a kawaii last week with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> optical</font>

442
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:24,139
internet working form I highly suggest

443
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,690
having a meeting there

444
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,700
really nice getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Hawaii was rather</font>

445
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:32,030
cheap<font color="#E5E5E5"> too I mean it's like 150 bucks at</font>

446
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,590
night for the hotel<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yes might look at</font>

447
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:36,649
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> going there in the future</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

448
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,899
really liked it anyway we're defining 56

449
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:41,000
gigabit per second electrical interfaces

450
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,070
there we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just starting that it's</font>

451
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,230
probably three to four your effort we're

452
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:48,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that's the same rate is going</font>

453
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:51,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be used for 64 gig fibre channel and</font>

454
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:55,250
it also defines 40 gigabit cereal as

455
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:57,560
well so 40 256 gig for cereal lanes so

456
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:01,610
you take eight of those and you got 400

457
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:03,800
gig now looking at a terabit we're

458
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,959
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for d'Alene so 25 gigabits per</font>

459
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,540
second and we you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't even</font>

460
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,070
defined that yet of how to do the 25 gig

461
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,510
we're we're getting there I mean that's

462
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a night Ripley right</font>

463
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">now but it just takes a lot of effort</font>

464
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,690
we're going against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the laws of physics</font>

465
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,970
here again of trying to get a long

466
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,620
distance over that fiber we have

467
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">shannon's limit working against us</font>

468
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,879
there's a lot of lect rana forward error

469
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,350
correction and different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we can</font>

470
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,900
do and we're throwing everything we got

471
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,790
at it and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there 25</font>

472
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,250
gig but we need to make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> low cost and</font>

473
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:35,659
low power I mean there's pretty good

474
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:38,690
correlation between something that's

475
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:41,750
high power and high<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost not only from</font>

476
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:45,410
operating expense but from capex expense

477
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:47,390
as well so but after<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get those 50 gig</font>

478
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,820
we could do 20 lanes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hippie gig</font>

479
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:52,880
that's still a lot if you guys know like

480
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:55,760
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CFP form factor supports 12 lanes of</font>

481
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,350
10 gig today and that's again about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

482
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,810
size of a cell phone that late the

483
00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,610
latest hundred gig module that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

484
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:04,700
deployed today we're defining one half

485
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:06,620
the size now cfp<font color="#CCCCCC"> too but we're at least</font>

486
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">a year away from production on that so</font>

487
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:13,040
anyway if terabit is just too many lanes

488
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,870
at not high enough speed we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

489
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">get there but it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be five plus</font>

490
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:20,689
years out it looks like but we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

491
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:25,760
to do 400 gig in the next couple years

492
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:27,730
so that's why we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that I</font>

493
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,140
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> are to answer this question</font>

494
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:34,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's just mainly economic feasibility</font>

495
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:37,720
and technical feasibility now here's

496
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:41,320
what we're going to be deciding and 400

497
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:45,460
gig is what what PMDs or what physical

498
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:48,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">variants you have we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> define so</font>

499
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,440
right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I show all the PMDs from 100</font>

500
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:54,790
Meg to 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig that's in the data center</font>

501
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:57,070
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the far right you can see the dark</font>

502
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:59,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">blue is single mode fiber the light blue</font>

503
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:02,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have as much bandwidth</font>

504
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,570
length product so it's shorter distances

505
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:06,730
in the light blue we have twisted pair

506
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:10,780
we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of problem get into 100</font>

507
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:13,330
meters at 10 gig so we're looking at 40

508
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:14,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">G</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> base t right now defining the</font>

509
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,740
objectives for that and it comes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

510
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:19,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">this reach media thing if 10g base t had</font>

511
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,550
only been defined at 10 meters for top

512
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,530
of the rack switches we could have done

513
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:26,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">it really quick it'd be really low power</font>

514
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:28,030
and to probably deployed everywhere but

515
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,090
we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the objective of going 100 meters</font>

516
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:33,520
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult to make that in</font>

517
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,649
the technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day now we're</font>

518
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting to that point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where 10g based he</font>

519
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:40,240
is being deployed now widely so going

520
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:43,000
over one step from that you have the

521
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,860
fuchsia color twinax then we have the

522
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,920
backplane applications that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

523
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:50,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">meter and then we have the electrical</font>

524
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,370
interface which a matter of inches so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

525
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:54,370
should have explained this at the start

526
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:56,560
that we have distance in the logarithmic

527
00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:00,370
scale on the bottom axis and we have

528
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:02,500
speed going up and the other axis so

529
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,810
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a lot of projects right now</font>

530
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,030
at a hundred gig or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> projects we're</font>

531
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,889
doing all these different PMDs that you

532
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,780
can see by these empty circles so these

533
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,510
are subject subject to change they're

534
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:16,210
not standardized yet the backplane ones

535
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:18,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">are getting pretty close but we're going</font>

536
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have 11 different physical variants</font>

537
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:25,270
in or interfaces at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred gig so you</font>

538
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:27,880
can see like it at 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> Meg we had three</font>

539
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:31,300
different variants one gig we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

540
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,890
10 gig we had 6 40 gig we're going to

541
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,379
have seven after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're defining a</font>

542
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,690
40-kilometer<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 40 gig right now then</font>

543
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:40,870
add a hunter gig we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have 11</font>

544
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:43,570
various so for 400 gig to do this

545
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:45,939
quickly we can't define that many number

546
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,539
of variants<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would hope that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll do</font>

547
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,509
like three variants one

548
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:52,249
probably 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> kilometers single-mode fiber</font>

549
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:54,440
another for multimode fiber to maybe a

550
00:23:52,249 --> 00:23:58,580
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> meters and then the electrical</font>

551
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:02,419
interface of 16 x 25 gig so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

552
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:04,070
where let me just<font color="#E5E5E5"> progress on so if we</font>

553
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:06,289
pick a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things or we pick</font>

554
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:08,989

555
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:10,729
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> take five years if we just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do 16</font>

556
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:13,850
lanes of 25 we should be able to do it

557
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:16,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">within a couple two to three years and</font>

558
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:18,918
we'll be starting that starting in march

so the ethernet<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alliance to support this</font>

565
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:35,689
we're doing is building consensus for

566
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:37,700
400 gig to understand if there's a broad

567
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:42,559
market potential what reach we're going

568
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:44,659
to have and what media so the broad

569
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,580
market potential is basically how many

570
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:50,989
ports of 400 gr we're going to ship and

571
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:53,389
say 2015 if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 ports then we it's</font>

572
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:55,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard to justify the project we</font>

573
00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:58,719
need thousands of ports leading to

574
00:24:55,099 --> 00:25:01,460
millions of ports to substantiate or

575
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,190
make the investment worthwhile for the

576
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:07,039
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet industry right I mean to</font>

577
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">get to 100 100 gig now we've invested</font>

578
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,179
hundreds of millions of dollars

579
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:13,789
individual switchblades can cost tens of

580
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:16,399
millions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to develop so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

581
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:19,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">only sell hundreds of ports of these</font>

582
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:22,039
it's hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back that investment we</font>

583
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:24,259
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get one to do 400 gig at</font>

584
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:26,509
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right time when thousands of ports</font>

585
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:29,080
are needed so that its<font color="#CCCCCC"> low cost again</font>

586
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:31,669
that's one of that's our new mantra and

587
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:35,539
the I Triple E is it has to be cost

588
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:37,249
effective per bit it has to be less 400

589
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:39,470
gig has to be less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> four times the</font>

590
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:41,749
cost of a hundred gig to make it widely

591
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,759
deployed and of course those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all</font>

592
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:47,720
seen these exponential<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop off and</font>

593
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:51,109
price as well so reach and media again

594
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,479
that's that's real important if we if we

595
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:57,080
pick right now we're really sweating it

596
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:58,759
defining four lanes of 25 gig to 100

597
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,379
meters that's where it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we're</font>

598
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:04,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to use feck</font>

599
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:08,600
and equalization<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andrey timers all this</font>

600
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:12,050
stuff to get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get to 100</font>

601
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:14,060
meters so to summarize again the

602
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:15,850
bandwidth were<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing on average we</font>

603
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:19,070
think it's about fifty eight percent

604
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:21,949
every year that means it doubles every

605
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:25,370
18 months and every five years it goes

606
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:27,050
by a factor of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten every 10 years your</font>

607
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,850
traffic today is<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one percent of</font>

608
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:31,250
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll be in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred</font>

609
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:33,199
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> growth so there's some rules at</font>

610
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,420
them that hopefully you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can remember and</font>

611
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,850
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and judge your industry is it</font>

612
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,170
growing less or more if you're in the

613
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:41,689
mobile<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone industry you're growing</font>

614
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:43,880
more than that probably so we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> created</font>

615
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:47,810
in the I Triple E that consensus ad hoc

616
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:50,420
and we're developing the consensus to do

617
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:53,360
a cfi to start the standardization in

618
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:55,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">March we expect it to be 400 gig we have</font>

619
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,639
pretty good consensus on that what we

620
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,450
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have is on the physical layer</font>

621
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,910
specifications the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach and media</font>

622
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,760
that's where we could have your input do

623
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:06,710
you want a new type of parallel fiber

624
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,830
ribbon fiber that's 16 fibers instead of

625
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:11,660
the standard 12 that we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> love for you</font>

626
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,669
to come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ethernet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Alliance and</font>

627
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,050
tell us what you need as well as you can

632
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,130
growth that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've been saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

633
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:30,610
and I've go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to data centers I these guys</font>

634
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:32,930
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like oh my god</font>

635
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:35,149
everything is growing so fast I just

636
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:37,580
have a thousand things to deploy within

637
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:42,680
the next two months this growth is just

638
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:45,980
crazy so I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear those stories</font>

639
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:51,200
and I'll pass them on so all rights good

640
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:54,200
i believe we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question Randy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bush</font>

641
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">ioj it's really cool that you've</font>

642
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:00,260
seriously enhanced the performance the

643
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:03,320
presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the 15 years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aside</font>

644
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:07,040
from just adding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 and changing the</font>

645
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:11,480
dates but it's the same excuses the same

646
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:14,450
numbers except x 10 how much 40 gig

647
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">there did we really use vs finally once</font>

648
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:19,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">he came through hopping to a hundred</font>

649
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:21,170
come on we're going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

650
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:23,480
thing can't we learn from last time we

651
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:25,880
understand you want it wait until it

652
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:30,560
there's enough need that its commodity

653
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:33,740
and it pays<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it that's cool but can</font>

654
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,929
we focus on the goal not though<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

655
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,070
this is where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I was trying</font>

656
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,510
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you is there's the network</font>

657
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,210
perspective it then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a server</font>

658
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:43,190
perspective so the network is growing at

659
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:46,340
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rate but the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> server's</font>

660
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:49,010
aren't they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing that fast so</font>

661
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:51,080
what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing now is more 40 gig is</font>

662
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:54,260
being deployed than 100 gig I mean we

663
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,629
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a serve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 25 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

664
00:28:54,260 --> 00:29:00,740
so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> even by Lori just move the</font>

665
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:03,560
decimal point well we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it we</font>

666
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,300
we we will do terabit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just tried</font>

667
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:08,210
to show you how weak we don't know how

668
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:10,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">to economically do that we know how to</font>

669
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:12,710
economically do 40 gig<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a qsfp today</font>

670
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,240
though<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're we're seeing</font>

671
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:16,490
wide scale deployment what's nice about

672
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,700
40 gig<font color="#E5E5E5"> too is we break it out into four</font>

673
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:22,250
lanes at 10 gig with octopus cables so

674
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:26,720
we see that being widely deployed and

675
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:34,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost-effective any other questions we</font>

676
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:38,170
have time for one more question<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um</font>

677
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:38,169
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much Scott that was great</font>

678
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:50,420
so it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to leave the meat locker</font>

679
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:53,270
and go to lunch sorry about the

680
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:59,060
temperature in this room we will

681
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:59,889
reconvene<font color="#E5E5E5"> at two-thirty and I just want</font>
