00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,509
hello all right guys let's settle down

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">real quick here we're starting the 1130</font>

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:14,280
session and we have three excellent

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,170
talks would encourage you guys to turn

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,750
off your Wi-Fi and start paying

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:25,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">attention for a change so first up we</font>

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:29,880
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> Philippa guilt from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> University</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:32,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Toronto also accepted a faculty position</font>

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,790
at Stony Brook so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> an earful ation</font>

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:43,260
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to welcome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Philippa to na</font>

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:46,469
nóg so first time thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,809
introduction yes so my Wi-Fi is off I

13
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,520
hope yours is off to today what I'm

14
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,620
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about is results of</font>

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,690
a preliminary survey we did of network

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,910
operators to try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a better feel of</font>

17
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,129
what sorts of routing policies are being

18
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">used in practice and really the goal</font>

19
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,378
this talk isn't just to present results

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,450
of a survey but rather to get feedback

21
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> input from you guys and try to get a</font>

22
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,740
better idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how you guys are routing</font>

23
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,030
traffic between your networks so here

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,630
I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in inter domain</font>

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,240
routing policies you might be wondering

26
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">why academic researchers are so</font>

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,750
interested in your writing policies

28
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:26,700
parlor is enforcing the internet for

29
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,340
example we might look at existing

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,439
protocols like ipv6 and try to reason

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,470
about why deployment is so challenging

32
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,559
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example we might look at how the</font>

33
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">performance of ipv4 to ipv6 conversion</font>

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,049
plays a role or how the connectivity of

35
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,929
a s is on the ipv6 internet plays a role

36
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">in networks incentives to deploy we also</font>

37
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,130
look at existing protocols like<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp sec</font>

38
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,380
and try to understand how effective

39
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,360
they'll be so what attacks will still be

40
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible and what sorts of impact will</font>

41
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,909
they have is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like bgp stack is</font>

42
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,340
deployed in the future researchers<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

43
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,869
sometimes take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer-term</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view and we</font>

44
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,210
propose completely new<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter domain</font>

45
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,128
routing protocols sometimes for example

46
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,829
a version of<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP that depends only on</font>

00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next hop a s in this case it's</font>

48
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,500
really important that we

49
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">can understand today's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

50
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,370
know how these protocols will behave if

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,880
they were in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be deployed</font>

52
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the past couple years there's also</font>

53
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,230
been a lot of interest in terms of the

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet in its relationship to policy</font>

55
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:31,470
for example in January 2011 we saw Egypt

56
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,300
use BGP to cut off their internet access

57
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,220
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need to understand the</font>

58
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet and how it plays a role</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in some</font>

59
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:43,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these government censorship and</font>

60
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:46,290
policy incidents so why is answering

61
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:48,268
these questions so challenging how the

62
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,870
reason for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that we can't always</font>

63
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:53,730
run experiments on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet itself</font>

64
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,350
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to study prefix</font>

65
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,359
hijacks we can't go out and hijacked

66
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,739
someone's IP prefixes and see what

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,430
happens just for the sake of our

68
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:04,560
research project<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we have a</font>

69
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,239
protocol that isn't fully tested we

70
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,860
can't go out and ask a network to deploy

71
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,230
it and kind of just hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works in</font>

72
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,700
practice on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and this</font>

73
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenge of getting networks to deploy</font>

74
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,459
protocols is really a bottleneck here

75
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:20,160
even if we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that is fully</font>

76
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,720
tested and fully mature if we had to

77
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,310
wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for multiple networks to deploy it</font>

78
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,549
before we could evaluate it we would

79
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">never get any work done because of this</font>

80
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:30,959
what research researchers spend a lot of

81
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,630
time doing is simulating the behavior of

82
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,940
entities on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet we do this</font>

83
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,850
using a combination of empirical data

84
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,920
from things like bgp monitors as well as

85
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:44,190
models of how entities are going to

86
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,320
behave an example of this is the a esta

87
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,870
pology where researchers use a

88
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,150
combination of data from<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp monitors as</font>

89
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,650
well as a model of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business</font>

90
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:54,780
relationships networks are using when

91
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,480
they connect in order to derive an AS

92
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,920
graph once the researchers have an ass

93
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,540
graph they want to understand how

94
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,358
traffic is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to flow on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> graph</font>

95
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,120
and this is done with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> combination of</font>

96
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:07,799
routing policy models so modeling how

97
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,910
networks are going to choose paths and

98
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,730
how they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to announce these</font>

99
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,400
paths to their neighbors and also a

100
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">model of traffic matrices so how much</font>

101
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,280
traffic is each<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network sending to every</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second point that I'm going</font>

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,420
the time that they did their study the

112
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,240
goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this model</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is to provide a</font>

115
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,080
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to emphasize here that the goal</font>

116
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,900
isn't to capture the behavior of each of

117
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,789
the 40,000 a<font color="#E5E5E5"> esas on the internet but</font>

118
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,620
rather to get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> general sense of what</font>

119
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:01,890
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the networks out there are doing</font>

120
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,060
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can run simulations and part</font>

121
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">of my goal here today is to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

122
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,450
understand if this model<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font>

123
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,700
capturing what most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the networks are</font>

124
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,440
doing or if you guys are seeing a lot of

125
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,570
exceptions to this model in your network

126
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,100
and if these exceptions are something we

127
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:18,060
should maybe be building into a new

128
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:20,640
model of routing policies the routing

129
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,140
policy model gives us two basic

130
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,969
components the first is this path

131
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,039
selection algorithm and this basically

132
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,650
dictates how ISPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to be</font>

133
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,030
choosing their paths on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet the</font>

134
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,700
first step of the path selection

135
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:35,400
algorithm approximates local<font color="#CCCCCC"> pref based</font>

136
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,650
on a model of business relationships for

137
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,989
example on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here we have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP</font>

138
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,870
and he's got a customer who's going to

139
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,610
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> him for transit he has a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peer that</font>

140
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,560
he engages in settlement for appearing

141
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,720
with so when I say peer I'm not talking

142
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">about just any bgp peer I'm only talking</font>

143
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,919
about settlement free peers and he also

144
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,500
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a provider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that he's going to pay</font>

145
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:57,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">for transit and if you look carefully at</font>

146
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,080
this diagram you'll see that money is

147
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,210
basically following the arrows what the

148
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,859
routing policy model says is that the

149
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISP is going to choose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> route through</font>

150
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,130
his customer before he wrote through a

151
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,530
peer before he routes through provider

152
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,460
so he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to send traffic on</font>

153
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:15,239
the link<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to generate</font>

154
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,430
revenue for him if the ISP has multiple

155
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,530
paths with an equal local prep value it

156
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,780
then goes down to preferring the

157
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,909
shortest path and if there's still

158
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,250
multiple equally good paths it then goes

159
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">down to an arbitrary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tiebreak so one</font>

160
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,210
thing this model is not capturing is

161
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:34,010
things like introdu mean outing or meds

162
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,010
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the route selection process</font>

163
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,120
so the second part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the routing policy</font>

164
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:42,780
model is this notion of export policy

165
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,210
and the expert policy basically says the

166
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,640
ISP has chosen a path who is the ISP

167
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:50,370
going to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this path and it has</font>

168
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,870
two components so if the ISP learns a

169
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,370
path from a customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's going to pay</font>

170
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,960
him<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's going to tell all of his</font>

171
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">neighbors about this path because the</font>

172
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,239
customer is paying him to do so however

173
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he learns a path from a non customer</font>

174
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,350
so appear or provider he's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

175
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,830
send this path on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers who are</font>

176
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:10,110
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay him and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basic intuition</font>

177
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,180
here is that networks will only transit

178
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,490
traffic if it generates revenue for them

179
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,590
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do this if it</font>

180
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:21,060
doesn't generate revenue or worse yet it

181
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:22,859
costs them money you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice this</font>

182
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,480
model has a lot of assumptions about how

183
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,370
networks are going to behave in practice

184
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">and my goal here today is to validate</font>

185
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,970
how often these assumptions are holding

186
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,160
in your networks and what sort of

187
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,470
exceptions you're seeing and if you see

188
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,720
an exception is this exception done

189
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:40,380
usually or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just done in say a</font>

190
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,840
corner case an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really</font>

191
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,240
spurred this work was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> following our</font>

192
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,409
model has this assumption that a network

193
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,270
is going to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to route through a</font>

194
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,340
customer before<font color="#CCCCCC"> it routes through a peer</font>

195
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,409
network and when we look at the

196
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,150
empirical<font color="#E5E5E5"> a/s graphs that are published</font>

197
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,120
by different research groups we often

198
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:59,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">saw this topology where you have a s1 on</font>

199
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,080
the slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a settlement</font>

200
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,880
for appearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> linked to a content</font>

201
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,060
delivery network or a large content

202
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,630
provider however when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

203
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,880
topology this ALS also had a much longer

204
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:15,120
customer path to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the content delivery</font>

205
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,219
network in this case it doesn't seem

206
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,960
likely that this a s is going to want to

207
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this longer customer path when he</font>

208
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,030
has this direct settlement free peering

209
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:26,310
link and really one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my goals here</font>

210
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,979
today is to try to understand how often

211
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">these sorts of cases are happening where</font>

212
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,980
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a network who maybe would</font>

213
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,380
rather prefer a peering link over a

214
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,940
customer link as well as what other

215
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,490
deviations do you guys see from these

216
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,160
assumptions we also want to understand

217
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,960
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often this model holds so if you're</font>

218
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,490
if the routing in your network follows

219
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,200
this model very well I'd also be

220
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,450
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in hearing that but I'm</font>

221
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,880
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font>

222
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,890
this notion of exceptions so what sort

223
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,439
of business situations are causing

224
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:57,260
exceptions to happen how often<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

225
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,510
occurring and what types of networks are

226
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,100
having these exceptions so if you're

227
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,300
running a content provider is your

228
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:06,410
writing significantly different than

229
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:08,449
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say a Tier one network so the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this study is that as we know you know</font>

232
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,380
you guys all sit in different commercial

233
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,300
organizations with different business

234

238
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,640
with your routing policy and the goal

239
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,069
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really to understand this notion</font>

240
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,069
of exception versus the rule so what

241
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:33,020
exceptions are you seeing but also if

242
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,970
there's a general consensus of how

243
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,530
routing is being done on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

244
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,880
I'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's</font>

245
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:41,569
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the networks are</font>

246
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,460
doing how we went about resolving these

247
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,380
challenges was that we performed an

248
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,690
informal survey of network operators

249
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,800
about their routing policy and it's the

250
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,080
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the survey that I'm going to</font>

252
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,200
emphasize here that the survey<font color="#E5E5E5"> was very</font>

253
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,580
preliminary and there's still a long way

00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,710
to go so part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the reason I'm here</font>

255
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,630
today is to ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your help we have</font>

00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,450
another survey posted at the URL on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

260

to tell me more about routing policies

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,480
in your network so with that I'm going

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:16,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to dive into our existing survey results</font>

nanog mailing list and other operators

266
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:25,280
centric mailing lists it consisted of a

267
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,470
set of yes/no questions about routing

268
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,689
policies and to get the participants an

269
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,870
opportunity to specify why they gave the

270
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:34,670
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> they gave and we also gave the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">networks an opportunity to specify what</font>

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,469
type of network they were operating so

273
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,300
after running this survey for a couple

274
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> months we ended up with 100 responses</font>

assumptions about local prep so our

networks going to assign a higher local

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,740
it's the local prep only going to depend

290
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,709
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that next hop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AS as it is in our</font>

291
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:23,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">model we also look at two assumptions</font>

292
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:25,268
about export policies so this notion

293
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:27,779
that networks will not export paths from

294
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:29,949
non customers to other non customers and

295
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:32,529
whether or not networks are doing some

296
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:34,959
sort of neighbor specific path selection

297
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:37,300
policy so will you always<font color="#E5E5E5"> send the same</font>

298
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,268
path to destination to all neighbors of

299
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,969
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same type the survey also covered</font>

300
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:45,070
other topics such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> MRA i prefer oldest</font>

301
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,760
path as well as some questions about<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

302
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,440
security that I won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> covering today</font>

303
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,959
so with that let's dive into this first

304
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,339
assumption the assumption basically says

305
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">that a network is going to assign a</font>

306
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,750
higher local<font color="#CCCCCC"> pref to a path through a</font>

307
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,300
customer then for a path through peer or

308
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,680
provider so the a s on the slide here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

309
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to route to his customer</font>

310
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">before he routes to his two other</font>

311
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,040
neighbors on the side<font color="#E5E5E5"> to validate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

312
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:10,839
assumption we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask the question if you</font>

313
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">always assign a higher local prep to a</font>

314
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:14,410
path through your customer then to a

315
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:17,110
path through your peer or transit

316
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:18,250
provider so if the assumption holds here

317
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,959
what we're expecting is that most

318
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,389
networks will say yes they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

319
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,649
prefer the customer path and when we

320
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:25,779
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the survey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> results the</font>

321
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:27,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">Assumption mostly holds with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

322
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:29,980
eighty percent of networks assigning a

323
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:32,800
higher local pref to pass through the

324
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,810
customers we then looked at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

325
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,120
comments people gave here and we saw

326
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,160
things like for the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that said yes</font>

327
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,779
we saw what you'd expect comments like

328
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,969
that's where the money flows these are

329
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:45,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">our customers they pay us of course we</font>

330
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,560
would choose to route to them however

331
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,060
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we looked at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the networks</font>

332
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">that responded no we saw more</font>

333
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:55,388
interesting things such as no we don't

334
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:56,979
use local<font color="#CCCCCC"> pref I'm not quite sure what</font>

335

337
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:03,370
in your network I'd be really interested

338
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:06,579
to know why and what sorts of criteria

339
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:08,380
are you using for selecting paths so to

340
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:10,269
summarize<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw that assumption one</font>

341
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,510

345
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,740
local hop or does the local prep depend

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,970
only on the next hop a s in order to

347
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,650
validate this assumption we ask the

348
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,510
question does your local<font color="#CCCCCC"> prep</font>

hop<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS and not on other guesses on the</font>

351
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,050
path so here we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font>

352
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:34,150
knowing whether networks were looking at

<font color="#E5E5E5">that next hop yes and here again if the</font>

355
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:43,270
assumption holds we were expecting a yes

356
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,790
response but the result here was

357
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:47,260
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> less clear and we see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that more</font>

358
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">than thirty percent of networks saying</font>

no their local prep is depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on more</font>

00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,510
than just that next hop a s and here we

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">really want to understand you know why</font>

362
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,560
are so many networks having local prep

363
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,050
depend on more than just that next hop

364
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,010
is and we looked into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the comments we</font>

365
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,810
didn't find a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good explanation</font>

366
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,550
here so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> broke it down by the</font>

367
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:10,959
different networks that responded to our

368
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:13,420
survey what we saw is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we look at</font>

369
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,160
tier<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones it's unanimous all of the tier</font>

370
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,930

371
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,990
their local prep is depending only on

372
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,640
that next hop a s but when we looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

373
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,370
the large content providers we saw more

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,710
exceptions for large content providers

375
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,050
that answered our survey they broke down

376
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,910
roughly evenly between yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and no in</font>

377
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,310
terms of local prep depending only on

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next hop es so if you're running</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

379
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,040
these large content provider networks

380
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,229
I'd be interested to learn more about

381
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,980
what sort of factors are impacting your

382
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,960
local<font color="#CCCCCC"> pref so to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> summarize for</font>

383
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,760
assumption<font color="#CCCCCC"> too we saw that it didn't</font>

00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">hold as strongly as assumption one and</font>

385
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,210
actually there tended to be more

386
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:53,439
exceptions for the large content

387
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:56,500
providers next we take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at the</font>

388
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,000
export policies and whether ases are

389
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,240
going to export paths from knowing

390
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,140
customers to other non customers to

391
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,910
illustrate what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean by this</font>

392
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,250
assumption we have an ass on the slide

393
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,829
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he's got a peer and provider if</font>

the pier<font color="#CCCCCC"> and providers send pass to this</font>

395

00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,640
on to customer networks oops

397
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:19,060
he should only send these paths on to

398
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,820
customer networks and not on to peer or

399
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,199
provider networks in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our de validate</font>

400
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,480
this assumption we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the following</font>

401
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">question we said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D announced paths from</font>

402
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,340
peers and providers to other peers and

403
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,260
providers so if the assumption holds

404
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">here the answer were expecting is no</font>

405
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,220
that networks are not announcing paths

406
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,530
from non customer networks to other non

407
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,150
customer networks and in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we</font>

408
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:42,520
looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the survey results</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we saw this</font>

409
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:44,140
assumption mostly holds with more than

410
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,699
seventy percent of networks saying that

411
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,300
they're not announcing paths from

412
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,650
non-customers to other non customers

413
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,540
when we looked into the comments here

414
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,920
when we looked into the no responses we

415
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,140
saw things like you would expect

416
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">networks saying we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not interested in</font>

417
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,819
being an unpaid transit provider however

418
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,040
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we looked at the exceptions things</font>

419
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,860
were more interesting we saw comments

420
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,199
like mostly to be a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> neighbor and</font>

421
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,000
secret agreements so when these

422
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,310
exceptions occur I'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested to</font>

423
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's normal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for an exception</font>

424
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:17,229
like this to occur or is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a special</font>

425
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:20,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">case we decide to be a good neighbor for</font>

426
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:22,420
some subset of your neighbors<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

427
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,560
know if you're transiting traffic for

428
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,270
non-customers I'd be really interested

429
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,510
in hearing more about why you're doing

430
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:30,490
this so to summarize<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw that</font>

431
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,800
assumption three held for about seventy

434
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:42,040
networks exporting paths of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

435
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,260
type to observe the exporting paths to a

00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,660
given destination<font color="#CCCCCC"> two neighbors of the</font>

437
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:49,210
same type that are the same so just to

438
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,339
clear this up let's draw a picture we

439
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:53,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an ass on the slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here with a</font>

440
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:56,070
provider and appear the provider tells

441
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,000
him one path to a destination prefix and

442
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,790
the pier is going to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them another</font>

443
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,500
path to this destination prefix if this

444
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,720
assumption holds the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s is going to</font>

445
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:07,030
export<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same path to this destination</font>

446
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,640
to all neighbors of the same type on the

447
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,960
slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> here that's customers so if he</font>

448
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,760
tells his customers about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path</font>

449
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,560
through his provider he shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

450
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,920
one customer that he's telling about

451
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:19,480
this path through his peer in order to

452
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,520
validate this assumption the question we

453
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,400
asked was do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do neighbor specific</font>

454
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,170
path selection for example selecting a

455
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,760
different path for different customers

456
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:31,900
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy reasons</font>

457
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,580
not due to hot potato routing etc and if

458
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,440
our assumption holds<font color="#E5E5E5"> here the answer</font>

459
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,560
we're expecting is no that networks are

460
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,060
not doing this / neighbor path selection

461
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,760
but when we looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the responses it</font>

462
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:45,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">was actually less clear-cut we see that</font>

463
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 40% of networks say yes they are</font>

464
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,919
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> neighbor specific path selection</font>

465
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,330
and when we look<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the responses here</font>

466
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,550
for the people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no it was what</font>

467
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,860
we would expect they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the policy</font>

468
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets too complicated if they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> select</font>

469
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,629
different paths for different customers

470
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,550
for policy reasons however there's still

471
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">this large number of networks that say</font>

472
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:08,440
they are doing per customer path

473
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:11,200
selection and we didn't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

474
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,760
satisfying responses in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the text</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> box</font>

475
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,930
with again we break it down by the

476
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,470
different networks that answered our

477
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:19,630
survey and here what we see is that

478
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">there tends to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be more exceptions for</font>

479
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:24,850
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tier 1 networks and large content</font>

480
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,230
providers so for the tier ones and large

481
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,810
content providers that answered our

482
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:31,840
survey more of them are saying yes they

483
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:34,360
do customer specific path selection than

484
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,189
are saying no and so I'd be really

485
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,110
interested in understanding why tier 1

486
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,360
networks and large content providers are

487
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:44,409
doing path selection on a per neighbor

488
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:46,120
basis so to sum up for assumption for we

489
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,890
see that mostly exceptions tend to be

490
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,770
four tier<font color="#CCCCCC"> one networks as well as for</font>

491
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,660
large content providers but i want to

492
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:54,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">emphasize here that even when the</font>

493
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,200
assumptions hold they never hold one

494
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,640
hundred percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we're still</font>

495
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,740
getting twenty to thirty percent of

496
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,240
networks that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> violating the</font>

497
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,360
assumptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are made by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this model</font>

498
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,830
so really<font color="#CCCCCC"> my goal here today is to get a</font>

499
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,189
but a better understanding of what sort

500
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:10,810
of corner cases are causing networks to

501
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,120
have these exceptions is their business

502
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:15,850
situations that are causing routing

503
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,800
policy to change if you're running a

504
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,060
specific type of network do you place

505
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,370
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> constraints on your routing</font>

506
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,500
policy and I'd really<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font>

507
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:26,229
hearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> more about your experiences in</font>

508
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,520
configuring routing policy and if you're

509
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,170
willing I'd really appreciate if you

510
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,700
could fill out the survey at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the URL on</font>

you guys have questions or if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting it's the time so I</font>

519
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,380
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one question one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

520
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,450
that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting is to</font>

521
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,890
understand what's the geographic spread

522
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:05,980
of the responses<font color="#E5E5E5"> if God does it</font>

523
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:08,560
primarily us are as it spread over we

524
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,960
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a summary of that since we</font>

525
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:13,480
sent it to nanog first it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was probably</font>

526
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,220
more North America focus but our

527
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,960
eventual goal is to get more worldwide

528
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,580
view yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting</font>

529
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,150
to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're observing is</font>

530
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,639
different from different<font color="#E5E5E5"> portions yeah</font>

531
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:26,080
anecdotally I've heard Europe has kind

532
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,250
of different routing policies and

533
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:32,620
business relationships my name is Andrew

534
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,610
Sullivan I have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question because some</font>

535
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,330
of those answers were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

536
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:39,310
surprising<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me too I wonder how how</font>

537
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:40,750
likely it is you think that some of

538
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">these answers are just wrong that is</font>

539
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,970
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are reporting incorrectly to you</font>

540
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,800
what they're actually doing yes I mean

541
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,110
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very good point the survey was</font>

542
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,430
very preliminary and as academics we

543
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,379
were still trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how to</font>

544
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,180
phrase these questions in a way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

545
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:59,830
operators could understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

546
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:01,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">asking I think it's definitely the case</font>

547
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,460
that some of these exceptions are

548
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,130
occurring but that's part of the goal

549
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">with our new survey is to get a better</font>

550
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,430
reading of what the operator community

551
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,070
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and whether some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

552
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,780
exceptions we're seeing are happening

553
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,820
often or if it's kind of a corner case

554
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,560
because with a yes/no question if

555
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,360
someone's done this one time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

556
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">neighbor they still technically could</font>

557
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:28,419
give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the unexpected response can I</font>

558
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:30,250
ask one question is has anybody in this

559
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:34,660
room responded to the service that they

560
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:37,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">sent out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's so we have a few hands</font>

561
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,500
showing up<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

562
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,179
let's thank our speaker
