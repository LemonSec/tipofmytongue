00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:07,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright thanks a lot John coming up next</font>

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,480
we have Lee Howard I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,150
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> total cost of ownership of</font>

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:17,150
carrier-grade NAT or throw the acronyms

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:20,160
out there TCO of CGN thanks Lee thanks

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,959
good morning my name is Lee Howard I

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,750
work for Time Warner Cable the director

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,039
of narrow technology there and my job is

9
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at technologies there are two to</font>

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,470
five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from being deployables</font>

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,070
one of the interesting things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font>

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do then is to when we have</font>

13
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,440
technologies that are a couple of years

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,940
away we need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at different</font>

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">evaluate different options different</font>

16
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,718
technologies and decide which ones we

17
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,629
want to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of thing</font>

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,969
that I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we said gee</font>

19
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:52,230
ipv6 looks like it's two to five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

20
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:54,870
away it was and so we ought to go start

21
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,949
to pulling out dv6 naturally we we find

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,440
ourselves here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dallas we find</font>

23
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,000
ourselves in the center of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the widest</font>

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,550
deployment of ipv6 the Time Warner Cable

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,330
has this is we have deployed ipv6 fairly

26
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,070
broadly across Texas we have but but

27
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,770
while we're doing the evaluation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

28
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:13,199
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I know that I want to do ipv6 I</font>

29
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,850
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about are there any other</font>

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,770
alternatives I think the carrier grade

31
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,330
net is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way to go but is</font>

32
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,520
there a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that I can quantify that is</font>

33
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,710
there a way that i can say here's here's

34
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,490
why carrier-grade NAT is not the most

35
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,809
the best idea for us so let me well let

36
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,250
me stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a second and say I'm going</font>

37
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:35,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and skip to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last slide</font>

38
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:37,799
the last slide says go to wws gorg that

39
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,540
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> email address is there and there's a</font>

40
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,119
link the page there it's called

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,189
documents and on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> page I have this</font>

42
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,810
slides the set of slides i have a

43
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,639
spreadsheet so you can do your own

44
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,770
numbers manipulation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have a</font>

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">10-page white paper explaining the whole</font>

46
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,369
methodology that i use for everything

47
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,750
I'm about to say with lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lots of</font>

48
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,030
footnotes so if you disagree with my

49
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,820
numbers where I got those numbers comes

50
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,469
from is all documented in in that white

51
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,199
paper so go ahead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> download it now if</font>

52
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,579
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll see what happens</font>

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,649
so I've already said this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not exactly</font>

54
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,568
<font color="#CCCCCC">I want to make clear I am NOT presenting</font>

55
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,640
Time Warner Cable's strategy this is not

56
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:14,079
a strategy document this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an analysis</font>

57
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,239
that I did the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea was</font>

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,160
we keep hearing that carry great nad is

59
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,900
going to be expensive well how expensive

60
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,340
is it it well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so there are three</font>

61
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,660
costs are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into that there's</font>

62
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,210
how much capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you going to spend</font>

63
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">theirs what's the OP X to maintain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

64
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,990
system and then there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we keep</font>

65
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,399
hearing that stuff breaks what is it

66
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that breaks and is there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any way to</font>

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,360
quantify the cost of that breakage and

68
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,160
that's really where I started from and

69
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,960
then once I was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,280
analysis I then said well what can I do

71
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that information what else does</font>

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">that tell me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so here's what here we go</font>

73
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,920
so what does carry<font color="#E5E5E5"> great net cost well I</font>

74
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,930
start with you have to buy some hardware

75
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,089
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT device</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a card</font>

76
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,640
in a router or maybe a 1u device and I

77
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,250
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of picked a round number of 10,000</font>

78
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:58,000
users so for a 10,000 user carrier-grade

79
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:59,350
NAT you need to buy a device now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,090
the list for seventy thousand dollars is

81
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,440
about an average<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the list prices of</font>

82
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,770
several different vendors that I talked

83
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,390
to so that's that's the number i picked

84
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,090
and that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a redundant pair</font>

85
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,339
because even with 10,000 users seems

86
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,440
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know a failure domain of a</font>

87
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,760
significant size but<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe an acceptable</font>

88
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,290
side depending on what kind of network

89
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,268
iran but you still probably want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

90
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">redundant pair of whatever they are</font>

91
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,910
you're going to have to do some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

92
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,810
systems development for your logging

93
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,100
systems and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

94
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,269
capitalized<font color="#CCCCCC"> abul and they're going to</font>

95
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to do some software development</font>

96
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:29,530
your provisioning systems your OSS your

97
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,089
discovery systems whatever else it is

98
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,040
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do there's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

99
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,989
more work required and it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

100
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,670
that for a smaller<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp that only has</font>

101
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,050
10,000 users it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> few</font>

102
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">months it's going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be about ten</font>

103
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,530
thousand dollars for a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> B</font>

104
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,850
it's going to scale up fairly linearly

105
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,380
for the number of systems that have to

106
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,730
be touched and developed in order to

107
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,590
handle you carry great Matt so that's

108
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,179
sort of where I got to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> number you</font>

109
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,459
can disagree with it that's fine this is

110
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,320
sort of to get an order<font color="#E5E5E5"> of magnitude for</font>

111
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:54,519
where we're going and then it's how much

112
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,930
is it gonna cost to run this thing once

113
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,970
you've bought a device it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

114
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,440
it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> space power cooling it's the</font>

115
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,790
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing the cabling it's</font>

116
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,680
the people who have to monitor the

117
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,570
monitoring systems all those sorts of

118
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,080
things so I sort of said ten<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand</font>

119
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,250
dollars a year yeah okay so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can it</font>

120
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,570
may be at seven thousand dollars a year

121
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,620
maybe it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifteen thousand dollars here</font>

122
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,269
but it's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of their in there</font>

123
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,950
and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go plug in your own</font>

124
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:16,540
numbers in spreadsheet and figure out

125
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,880
what it costs this is the boring part

126
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,489
where it gets interesting is when we say

127
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right what breaks well so I brought</font>

128
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:25,390
an intern in my lab a few years ago and

129
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,760
i said here's a couple of different CGN

130
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:31,360
vendors go test them with

131
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,310
everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can think of and and</font>

132
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,170
tell me what breaks and what we found

133
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">was head-to-head gaming through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> xbox</font>

134
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">breaks and and some PlayStation games</font>

135
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,960
we're breaking peer-to-peer networking

136
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,470
you could do downloads<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't do</font>

137
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,719
uploads Netflix with some home gateways

138
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,330
wasn't reachable or was significantly

139
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,550
degraded and a few other sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> minor</font>

140
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,169
things we're sort of we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

141
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,300
very well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will say this is all</font>

142
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:58,120
documented in the IETF draft draft

<font color="#CCCCCC">donnelly NAT 444 impacts their testing</font>

144
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,700
was a little bit different than my

145
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,650
testing and so that's that's all in

146
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,050
there and I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> point out that this</font>

147
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,109
document NAT 444 impacts has been

148
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:11,590
updated that subsequent testing shows

149
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:15,490
that the xbox 360 now does work through

150
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,989
carrier-grade NAT<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me let me</font>

151
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,600
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the ramifications that so</font>

152
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,340
here's what this table says I went to I

153
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">said well how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many users</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are there using</font>

154
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">an xbox or playstation or peer-to-peer</font>

155
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,510

156
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,160
are using these devices systems and I

157
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,300
came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these numbers all in the</font>

158
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,000
pit white paper for where the footnotes

159
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,730
come from so for ten out of ten thousand

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,040
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000 users something like 2100</font>

161
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,930
then we'll probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an xbox</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font>

162
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,310
that 2100 I don't know if all of them

163
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,040
are doing a head-to-head gaming so let's

164
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">say half use their Xbox to play games</font>

165
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,640
with somebody across town or across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

166
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,070
country or some other isp all right so

167
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,719
half users are potentially affected if

168
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">xbox gaming breaks through carry great</font>

169
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,120
net and half of users use the xbox in a

170
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,750
way that would break<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's how</font>

171
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:04,080
I get to that that 1050 number now total

172
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,460
swags I have no defense for this number

173
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,950
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers if you break their</font>

177
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,520
twenty five percent are going to call

181
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,520
they call first and then cancel<font color="#E5E5E5"> or just</font>

numbers you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick any numbers you</font>

185
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,330
want to the numbers certainly the

186
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,530
results certainly change but sort of

187
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,909
this here's the methodology that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went</font>

188
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fifty percent are affected</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">percent cancel take your own numbers</font>

191
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,440
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been told when I've given this talk</font>

192
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,300
before I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been told that I've aired on</font>

193
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,410
the low side and the high side for both

194
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,960
the number of support calls and the

195
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,340
number of cancellations<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I if anybody</font>

196
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,140
has a citation<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I can point to</font>

197
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,520
saying when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> break customers here's</font>

198
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,719
how many cancel I would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that</font>

199
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">they would really provide a lot of help</font>

200
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,240
for for the analysis that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing here</font>

201
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:00,340
so then I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the things that I know</font>

202
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,980
break how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will call</font>

203
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:06,010
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I end up with the the totals on the</font>

204
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,600
bottom there out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000 users that</font>

205
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,000
you put behind Kerry great net some

206
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,690
thick 6700 will be potentially affected

207
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,830
so me some 6700 will have one of the

208
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,160
systems that is potentially affected

209
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:21,400
some 3,600 will be actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> affect it</font>

210
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,140
plus or minus you'll get 914 support

211
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,120
calls when we get 914 customers

212
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">canceling all right that's actually</font>

213
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty significant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a real</font>

214
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,190
number maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a precise number but</font>

215
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,830
it's a real number let's let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

216
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so for each 10,000 users</font>

217
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,060
let's say you're the cost of a tech

218
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,710
support call is twenty dollars maybe

219
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,510
it's five if you've offshored maybe it's

220
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,340
58 depends on what tier they go to and

221
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,930
your customer care center and it depends

222
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,969
on how long the call is let's say it's

223
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">20 for a round number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's</font>

224
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,150
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cost you 914 calls times twenty</font>

225
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,710
dollars it's gonna cost you eighteen

226
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,500
thousand dollars in sport costs that's

227
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,270
for 10,000 users that you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

228
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,380
you put mind carry<font color="#CCCCCC"> big net you're paying</font>

229
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,599
eighteen thousand dollars in support

230
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,330
costs that's not insignificant but what

231
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,890
really kills you is if your average

232
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,870
revenue per user is four hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars</font>

233
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:07,840
a year by the way I went to the annual

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,520
reports for AT&T Verizon comcast and

235

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay total cost let's say you take it</font>

over five years you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

247
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,539
depreciate your CGN over five years okay

248
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,830
so you take your capex of seventy

249
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:44,680
thousand dollars do a straight line

250

here's what the in network engineers

254
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:55,480
have to think about so you'd appreciate

your capex over five years great 18,000

that customer support calls eighteen

260
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,160
ago well you know once you've done the

00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,980
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that just happens you know day</font>

266
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">one you deploy kari berry nat boom all</font>

your calls come in and then you done

268
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,079
with calls and then you losing the

270
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:23,949
three hundred sixty five thousand

00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:26,709
dollars in lost revenue that was per

272
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:28,870
year so<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiply that out times five</font>

273
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:31,209

almost two million dollars in lost

revenue and capex and opex and customer

277
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,269
pain well here's my conclusion by the

278
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,100
way the title slide was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:43,870
animated but I saved<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in PDF so we</font>

280
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,779
don't do animations so here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

281
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,760
conclusion CGN<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two million dollars</font>

282
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:51,550
for every 10,000 users it's used for or

283
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,189
forty dollars per user per year there

284
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,870
you go what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think no don't tell</font>

285
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">me yet that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

286
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,230
conclusion so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty</font>

287
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:01,630
shocking i think is a pretty radical

288
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,910
conclusion but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking through my</font>

289
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,740
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing this and you can quit with</font>

290
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,060
the numbers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you take xbox</font>

291
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,680
off of there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey it works</font>

292
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:13,000
perfectly it's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty nine dollars</font>

293
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you say hey you're if you break a</font>

294
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,660
thousand customers you're not going to

295
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,670
lose 250 you're going to lose 500

296
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,560
customers it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> like fifty five</font>

297
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,729
dollars per user per year that's why you

298
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to do your own math and take the</font>

299
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,240
spreadsheet and go and follow the white

300
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:26,769
paper and figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out for yourself</font>

301
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,790
this order<font color="#E5E5E5"> of magnitude seems pretty</font>

302
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:32,529
solid to me ok so if CGN is going to

303
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:36,010
cost you forty dollars per user per year

304
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:38,230
what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean alright would it be</font>

305
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,250
cheaper to just buy addresses I mean if

306
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,069
you see jen's going to cost forty

307
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,470
dollars and it had an ipv4 address we've

308
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:47,229
seen on a couple of very public

309
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,420
transfers have cost 1125 twelve dollars

310
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,600
per address it's cheaper to buy

311
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,910
addresses then is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> boise GN cool good</font>

312
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">I didn't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to play CGN anyway now</font>

313
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,600
above forty dollars once the price of

314
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,610
ipv4 addresses goes above forty dollars

315
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,810
per address then it's cheaper to deploy

316
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:07,089
CGN holy cow<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right is there a point</font>

317
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:09,010
where cg n becomes too expensive if you

318
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:09,400
keep if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at between 12</font>

319
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,830
and four

320
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,890
dollars by addresses at forty dollars

321
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:16,690
and up deploy CGN is there an upper

322
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:19,330
limit to the price of addresses where

323
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:20,590
you wouldn't deploy CGN anymore well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

324
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,170
went back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the annual reports of those</font>

325
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:25,420
large ISPs and on there are two of four

326
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:28,089
hundred dollars they reported an average

327
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,849
margin of thirty-five percent profit

328
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:31,960
margin so<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty five percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of forty</font>

329
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,200
dollars is one hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and forty dollars</font>

330
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,930
per user<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if you go and buy</font>

331
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,530
addresses in order to turn up new users

332
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:44,229
and you're spending seventy dollars to

333
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:47,199
buy an address then your margins just

334
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,640
been cut in half right so if you spend

335
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,720
seventy dollars you're no longer making

336
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,520
a hundred and forty dollar profit you

337
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,550
making a seventy dollar profit if the

338
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,829
price<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that address is $71 you're now</font>

339
00:11:54,550 --> 00:12:01,569
only making sixty nine dollars in profit

340
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:03,310
in fact at that point it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost</font>

341
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:05,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">effective you make a higher profit if</font>

342
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:08,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">you sell the address rather than turning</font>

343
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:11,020
up the customer wait what'd you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say</font>

344
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,320
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say that again if the price</font>

345
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,930
of an ipv4 address exceeds half of your

346
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,760
profit margin it's more profitable to

347
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,790
sell the address than to turn up the

348
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,950
customer at least in the one year roi

349
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,530
now I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what your CFO likes to</font>

350
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,300
do but in a one-year roi it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

351
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,130
profitable now you can decide well gee

352
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> average lifetime of a customer is</font>

353
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,360
actually two years okay to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ROI</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

354
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,160
maybe it's a five-year ROI is what you

355
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,770
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at okay so then you have to</font>

356
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,480
go to what's half of the five-year roi

357
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,510
okay five years customers worth seven

358
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,520
hundred dollars could prices reach<font color="#CCCCCC"> $350</font>

359
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:49,090
I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun conversation with Jeff</font>

360
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,860
Houston yesterday and he said oh yes in

361
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:53,100
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said oh yes I think something</font>

362
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,100
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

363
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:56,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to more of what</font>

364
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:59,040
Jeff fews net's say so here's conclusion

365
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,679
number two is between this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is advice to</font>

366
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,939
isps between zero and forty dollars by

367
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,499
addresses now maybe that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty nine</font>

368
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:06,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollars do your own math it's up to you</font>

369
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:07,439
between 0<font color="#CCCCCC"> and four dollars by addresses</font>

370
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:09,149
between forty dollars and seventy

371
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:11,309
dollars deploy carrier-grade NAT in

372
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:12,540
excess of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 70</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars deploy</font>

373
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:13,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">carrier-grade mad because you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

374
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,809
you want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and keep your customers but</font>

375
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:17,160
then you can actually crunch more

376
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:20,540
customers on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrier grade Matt and</font>

377
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,829
sell off those ipv4 addresses holy cow

378
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,939
that surprised<font color="#CCCCCC"> me an awful lot I never</font>

379
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:25,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say you should buy</font>

380
00:13:23,939 --> 00:13:26,969
a dress is rather than to play

381
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:28,949
carrier-grade NAT and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I never thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

382
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,600
would say you should sell addresses I'm

383
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:32,459
not actually providing counsel to

384
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,999
anybody here that would be a very bad

385
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:37,979
idea but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a very interesting</font>

386
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:41,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought experiment isn't it I'm guessing</font>

387
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,709
everybody's awake now maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kira</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> green</font>

388
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,239
net<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't that bad I never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thought I'd</font>

389
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:48,988
hear myself say that but let's take that

390
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:50,399
as a thought experiment okay so ipv6 is

391
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:52,980
coming real soon now that provides some

392
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,720
relief<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay web and email actually work</font>

393
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,209
pretty well through carrier-grade net I

394
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean you lose the the granularity be</font>

395
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:01,049
able to track your user if your content

396
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:03,359
guy as they move them among your content

397
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,679
properties you lose some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the law</font>

398
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,959
enforcement doesn't like it so you lose

399
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:08,850
some things but from the users

400
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,219
perspective they work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so who would</font>

401
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,329
you put behind your carrier grade NAT

402
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,249
I've only been only think of two<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to</font>

403
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:15,809
figure out who would be unaffected by

404
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:17,639
carrier-grade NAT who only uses things

405
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:19,740
that don't break one is to use deep

406
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,540
packet inspection take one of the DPI

407
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,309
vendors and go say hey I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

408
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,799
sniff all your traffic and if you're

409
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:27,420
using Xbox Live then I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

410
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,100
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> you behind Carey right net well</font>

411
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,589
that's pretty expensive and pretty

412
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,240
intrusive and it assumes that a user

413
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:34,290
who's not doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something now is never</font>

414
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,209
going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so it's pretty</font>

415
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,529
unreliable so the only other way I've

416
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,868
been able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out to get out how</font>

417
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:42,029
to do this is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let customers sort</font>

418
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:44,040
themselves into using carrier-grade NAT

419
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:45,389
and not using carrier-grade NAT how

420
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,368
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would a customer ever choose to</font>

421
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:51,419
use carrier-grade NAT I can only think

422
00:14:47,369 --> 00:14:53,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">of one reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's price so how</font>

423
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:55,559
would prices be affected by the use of

424
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:59,730
carrier-grade NAT in this you know 12

425
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:01,290
240 4278 kind of kind of era all right

426
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:04,110
if carrier-grade NAT cost forty dollars

427
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:06,329
per<font color="#CCCCCC"> year and a native I people are just</font>

428
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">costs 12 to seven dollars then that's</font>

429
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:08,550
the

430
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,010
increased<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP for deploying</font>

431
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,500
either a carrier-grade NAT service or up

432
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,970
we buy you an ipv4 address service so

433
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,880
you end<font color="#CCCCCC"> up having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tears you got your</font>

434
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:20,700
basic tier carry<font color="#E5E5E5"> great net and your</font>

435
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,160
native ipv4 address tier where you buy

436
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,540
when you buy them in a dress now so the

437
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,209
prices<font color="#E5E5E5"> will increase by forty dollars</font>

438
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,120
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CJN customer and 12 270 dollars</font>

439
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:32,460
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the purchase an ipv4 customer</font>

440
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,070
the problem there is that's actually

441
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,600
assuming that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> isp is just well so</font>

442
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,910
the ice be has two choices really the

443
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISP can either absorb that cost into</font>

444
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,900
their margin that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sound you just heard</font>

445
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:47,850
as a collective gasp among all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CFO's</font>

446
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:50,370
in the country or you can pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> that cost</font>

447
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,990
along the customer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> P is in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> general</font>

448
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,570
are for-profit entities and don't just

449
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,620
pass things long at cost right we

450
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,490
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> said there's a thirty five</font>

451
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:03,780
percent margin so the change<font color="#E5E5E5"> in pricing</font>

452
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:05,730
that i can predict is I 400<font color="#CCCCCC"> ARPU means</font>

453
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:08,819
thirty-three dollars a month on average

454
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,830
for broadband internet service so if you

455
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,140
increase the for the carrier a net at

456
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,730
forty dollars at forty dollars per<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

457
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,250
you're going to increase the cost by

458
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,620
thirteen percent for a decreased service

459
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,990
in other words from the internet we know

460
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,460
today add carrier-grade NAT and for that

461
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,860
privilege you get to pay thirteen

462
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,940
percent more as a consumer if as a

463
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,520
consumer you don't want carrier-grade

464
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,410
NAT well so as an ISP you can choose

465
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,970
where you're going to price that service

466
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:35,730
you're probably gonna price it at the

467
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,990
higher end of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address market right</font>

468
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,030
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to charge twelve</font>

469
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:41,040
dollars for to buy an address because

470
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">your cost per address may increase up to</font>

471
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,370
seventy dollars we said so if they

472
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,510
increase up to seventy dollars that's

473
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,370
the line that where you're going to set

474
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,810
your pricing so that seventy dollars

475
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,550
becomes<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty-one percent increase in</font>

476
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:53,790
order to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same service that you</font>

477
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:59,219
have now Wow or of course you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use</font>

478
00:16:53,790 --> 00:17:01,020
cut margins gasp I'm not done yet oh so

479
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,970
okay there's there's one more thing I

480
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,379
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring in here so this assumes and</font>

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,440
this is back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my Jeff Houston</font>

482
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,200
conversation so this assumes that it's

483
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,700
all costs right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs just deploy</font>

484
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,620
carrier-grade NAT and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they suck</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up the</font>

485
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost and either just absorb it or pass</font>

486
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:17,550
along it pestle on the consumers<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff</font>

487
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">Houston bumped in him at lunch yesterday</font>

488
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,428
and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> said you're thinking about this</font>

489
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,099
all wrong

00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:26,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">Carrie droid net can be a profit Center</font>

491
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:29,289
if you're running carrier-grade NAT then

492
00:17:26,769 --> 00:17:30,940
there are content guys who would if

493
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:35,289
you're running carrier-grade NAT their

494
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:40,299
content guys who would pay through the

495
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:42,519
nose to be inside your net there's a

496

premium CDN service to be on your net10

497
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,690
space and that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very because then</font>

498
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:47,769
they can see the actual addresses for

499
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,169
all those users and track them is

500

they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the various properties</font>

501
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:53,169
so in fact you can make money to put by

this was at lunch yesterday so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

504
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:58,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">been able to build this into the model</font>

505
00:17:56,379 --> 00:18:01,149
and see what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and then he</font>

506
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:05,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">said you're assuming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're only</font>

going to to log the have to multiplex 10

508
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,940
or 100 or a thousand users / ipv4

509
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:11,289
address the jeff has told me that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's</font>

510
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,190
actually seeing cases where you have

511
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:17,019
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> tuple netting meaning if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

512
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,909
thousand users going to a thousand

<font color="#E5E5E5">different websites they can share the</font>

514
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:23,590
same outside address and port number it

515
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:25,299
because you only need that same outside

516
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:26,649
address and port number for each of the

517
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:29,259
different instances when the response

518
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:31,748
comes back in you've mapped that that

519
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:33,909
website that's you know that website to

520
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:36,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same internal user so if you do a</font>

521
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:37,960
five tuple carrier-grade netting then

522
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:40,119
you actually of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you've got much</font>

523
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,889
larger logs but then you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

524
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,629
much greater compression of users to

525
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:44,619
ipv4 address that certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps you</font>

526
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:47,439
want to go sell off the rest of your

527
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:50,499
ipv4 addresses now then he says you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

528
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,259
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that you now have the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you put a time stamp on that somebody</font>

will pay you dearly for the ability to

say show me for that user<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can see i</font>

00:19:19,749 --> 00:19:22,899
website what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they click on next and</font>

542
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:24,820
then where do they go and before they

00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:25,988
came here<font color="#E5E5E5"> where do they come from that's</font>

00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">really valuable information now I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't again there's only 20 hours old</font>

546
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:31,149
I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really had time to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

547
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:33,850
this but I woke up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle tonight</font>

548
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:37,539
and I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right so</font>

549
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:41,230
if if a frequent flyer program will give

550
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:42,700
you something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a tenth of a cent in</font>

551
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,950
rewards for every hundred dollars you

552
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,120
spend that's probably about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value</font>

553
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually this is Jeff again that's</font>

554
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably about the value</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

555
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,710
information so what if users spend

556
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:51,850
online here you go here's the value of

557
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,820
the information of user spends ten

558
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,330
thousand dollars a year online<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

559
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,289
somebody who's going to buy this

560
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,139
information will give you ten dollars

561
00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:00,520
for each user's each user's data in

562
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,380
order to see where they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going all</font>

563
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">right ten dollars per user now you can</font>

564
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,740
need some kind of massive big data

565
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,960
system in order to log those five tuples

566
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,669
for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single every single flow</font>

567
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,409
that's created on your network that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data just bandwidth alone</font>

569
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:17,440

00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:18,760
break-even proposition just in<font color="#CCCCCC"> language</font>

571
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">my three o'clock in the morning kind of</font>

572
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,289
ramblings I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure and if it's about</font>

573
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,210
break even at three o'clock in the

574
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:27,340
morning there may be some more

575
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,110
interesting research to be done there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

576
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,730
this is conclusion three and a half and

577
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:32,320
this is really scary to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me because I</font>

578
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:39,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't even thought of this and I told</font>

579
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:45,428
Jeff you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very bad man evil yes says</font>

580
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:47,200
the guy from google so how far can we go

581
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:49,539
I've already gone pretty far in this

582
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,480
thought experiment so how far can we go

583
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:54,070
okay so as an ISP runs out of ipv4

584
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,900
addresses obviously it's got to conserve

585
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,580
those addresses for its most profitable

586
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,110
customers now I already said you can

587
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:01,360
make customers you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> charge more for</font>

588
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:03,370
an AWP v4 address and that becomes your

589
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,559
more profitable customer the rationale

590
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">is P is going to say hey see jen's</font>

591
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:08,799
really expensive buying a dress is

592
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,750
really expensive as I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing these</font>

593
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,789
kinds of services I have to roll<font color="#E5E5E5"> it ipv6</font>

594
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,770
just so there's an exit strategy and I

595
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:17,760
can reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> my costs back out of the</font>

596
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:20,889
carrier-grade NAT or buying ipv4

597
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,200
scenarios but you can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> change a</font>

598
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,299
customer service either to add the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CGN</font>

599
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,580
option or the buying you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ipv4</font>

600
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:29,980
address option until contract renewal

601
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,780
time right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay contract renewal</font>

602
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:35,770
comes up and you say hey customer your

603
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:37,059
contract is set to renew we have new

604
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,830
service two years and you get to choose

605
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:40,299
whether you want basic or advanced or

606
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,820
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess I said here standard or</font>

607
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:45,340
advanced again the CGN or the native

608
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,020
ipv4 solution but hey congratulations

609
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,709
what an excellent choice you've made

610
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,120
will

611
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,490
increase your bill to reflect that and

612
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,820
here's a shiny new cable modem or DSL

613
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:58,390
modem or whatever CBE you choose that

614
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:00,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">supports ipv6 fantastic now wait a</font>

615
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:03,460
minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if it cable it if it</font>

616
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,520
contract renewal time an ISP starts to

617
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,559
change its services to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in then</font>

618
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:10,330
again I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could not find any sources</font>

619
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,658
online telling me the average lifetime

620
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:17,110
the average contract term for for a

621
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:20,200
residential customer so my conclusion is

622
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:22,979
one whatever the value of contract term

623
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:26,289
is after an ISP runs out of ipv4

624
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:29,679
everyone at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is people have ipv6 so</font>

625
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:31,658
how fast is that really well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay when</font>

626
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:35,350
Aaron runs out Jeff currently projects

627
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:36,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time middle of 2013 in the Aaron</font>

628
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,020
region he's got that probability curve

629
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:42,190
so you don't know whether it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

630
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:45,908
be April or August or December but let's

631
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:49,809
say it's middle of 2013 and let's say an

632
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:51,429
average contract is on a year two years

633
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:53,740
somewhere in the middle of a teen months

634
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:55,299
the prudent<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP is going to make sure</font>

635
00:22:53,740 --> 00:23:00,190
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of its customers have accessed</font>

636
00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:02,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv6 by the end of 2014 hey I actually</font>

637
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,899
came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a conclusion i kinda like I</font>

638
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:07,719
actually concluded something here that

639
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:09,729
says look ipv6 is not only<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming it's</font>

640
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,590
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only going to be here soon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

641
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,080
pick a date and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fairly arbitrary date</font>

642
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:21,100
but I can say look if ISPs are prudent

643
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:22,299
and rational oh if ISPs are prudent in

644
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,340
rational then they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be deploying</font>

645
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:26,830
ipv6 very rapidly over the next couple

646
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,689
of years as they approach run out so in

647
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">summary here my for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusions</font>

648
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,260
carrier-grade NAT costs<font color="#CCCCCC"> two million</font>

649
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">dollars over the course of five years</font>

650
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,570
for every 10,000 users you apply it for

651
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:39,250
and that debt divides out to forty

652
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,720
dollars per user per year again if you

653
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,370
take out<font color="#CCCCCC"> xbox it's more like twenty nine</font>

654
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,020
dollars by the way if you add in the

655
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,178
cost of buying addresses to put on the

656
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,230
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your carrier-grade NAT</font>

657
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,809
depending on the cost of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the address and</font>

the price curves of ipv4 addresses and

671
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,660
he says it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting thing in</font>

682
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:45,820
is that the price of ipv4 addresses will

be at its peak right before Aaron runs

than they currently are and the future

<font color="#CCCCCC">sure I can't I can't handle the math</font>

that he does there but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

690
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,959
interesting assertion<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so between</font>

691
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,820
forty dollars and seventy dollars deploy

kari regrading at above<font color="#CCCCCC"> seventy dollars</font>

693
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,658
it's more profitable<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell the address</font>

694
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,600
than it is to use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> address to turn</font>

695
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:15,970
up a customer we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at those</font>

696
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,559
prices and say prices would likely

00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,610
increase if eyes peas are incurring

698
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,710
these costs they're going to add those

699
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,840
prices they're going to pass those costs

700
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,870
with profit margin along to their users

701

at thirteen or twenty one percent

00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:50,950
here so you can see my methodology my

711
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:53,320
sources for the numbers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

715
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,580
a spreadsheet there that says plug in

716
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,320
your own numbers do the math<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here's</font>

717
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,668
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with I have about</font>

718
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,500
4 minutes left maybe a little long

719
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:08,350
before the break I would be delighted to

720
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:12,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">take questions and comments I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,749
watched my profile

my math class proved that two equals<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

725
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:26,090
yes and wow that was a flashback but the

726
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,629
one assumption that I can't help but

727
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:31,908
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is being overlooked is that you're</font>

728
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:33,799
assuming that when everyone goes to v6

729
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:35,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">that everything's going to work and</font>

730
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:37,970
they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to disconnect from you</font>

731
00:26:35,749 --> 00:26:40,279
and go to a provider that does before

732
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">because v6 maybe doesn't get them where</font>

733
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:44,720
they want to go right well of course

734
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:47,210
ipv6 works that's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what take is</font>

735
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,129
given<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ipv6 worse now actually one</font>

736
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:52,549
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do say the paper is</font>

737
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:54,259
that although ISPs what I'm sure love to

738
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:55,820
be able to pass those costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> longs</font>

739
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:57,499
that our customers in a competitive

741
00:26:57,499 --> 00:27:02,419
that because people<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go can go down</font>

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">the street to the next ISP and in turn</font>

743
00:27:02,419 --> 00:27:06,499
up service with them so yeah you may

744
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:08,389
have to you know and that's that's a

745
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,710
pretty scary idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the person</font>

that paper at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the folks wondering about</font>

750
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:21,350
the seemingly counterintuitive result

751
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,480
that prices should be always decreasing

752
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,459
that's a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> that turns on the fact</font>

753
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,440
that everyone knows everything and no

754
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,559
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ever surprised the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

assumption that economists love to make

right if you knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly how quickly</font>

757
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,249
ipv6 could be implemented<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you knew</font>

758
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:39,259
how much before was out there what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

759
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:41,539
price trajectory would be then there

760
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:43,759
would be no<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason for prices ever to</font>

761
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:45,169
increase for before because the asset

762
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,059
would only be getting less valuable if

763
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:49,519
there can be negative supply shocks

764
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:52,009
positive demand shocks the economy grows

765
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,200
faster v6 doesn't work then that

766
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:56,539
conclusion wouldn't follow but I wanted

767
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,460
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just weigh in on one other aspect of</font>

the of the slides quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

769
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,590
provoking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course the best</font>

770
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:06,889
analysis of its kind what we saw this

771
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:09,019
morning was all<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis of demand but</font>

772
00:28:06,889 --> 00:28:11,629
we didn't hear much about was supply and

773
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:13,220
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were to price water by thinking</font>

774
00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:15,529
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a thirsty man might be</font>

775
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,419
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay in the desert you could</font>

776
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:19,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a very funny estimate of what water</font>

777
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:21,350
is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cost if all you did was</font>

778
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:22,820
think about what you'd be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay</font>

779
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,678
what you'd be willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay if you were</font>

780
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,269
thirsty in the desert in fact water

781
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:28,070
isn't priced that way because there's a

782
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:28,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of it there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of supply of</font>

783
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,309
water and so the price

784
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:33,799
water is pretty close to<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero how about</font>

785
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:35,989
v4 there's before out there there are

786
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:38,779
people who can vacate their<font color="#CCCCCC"> v4 pushing</font>

787
00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:40,519
the price back down and a lot of folks

788
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:42,409
who might do pretty well to sell it the

789
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,659
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of prices that we saw on the board</font>

790
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:46,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I I wouldn't be too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quick to assume</font>

791
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:49,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the market clearing price will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

792
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:51,679
in the sorts of ranges just discussed if

793
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,659
it got to those ranges then I think we

794
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,069
know what we should do as ISPs but that

795
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:57,199
doesn't mean we'll actually be at those

796
00:28:55,069 --> 00:29:01,489
numbers so it's your assertion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

797
00:28:57,199 --> 00:29:04,789
does not equal one today so um actually

798
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:06,109
that's that's an excellent point and and

799
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:08,629
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you that we talked</font>

804
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:18,709

that monetization is worth way more than

853
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:24,970
the capital<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost of the CGN or its</font>

854
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:27,540
effects as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself showed once they</font>

855
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:31,030
get into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mold and monetize it</font>

856
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:35,139
what's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cost to get them to</font>

857
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:39,760
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of it thank you as I said you</font>

859
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,270
what Bobby flame has to say about the

860
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,100
topic to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bobby's with the FBI and they</font>

861
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:48,340
have interesting thoughts but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

862
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:52,090
tracking of IP addresses yeah that's um

863
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:53,560
oh and I wonder if then hey that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

864
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:55,240
money might have a chilling effect on

865
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Internet economy if people would be</font>

866
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,520
nervous<font color="#CCCCCC"> about being tracked that well Oh</font>

867
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:03,090
jeff has a response to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hands</font>

868
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:05,350
up everyone with a frequent flyer card

869
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,918
yeah we're all really nervous about it

870
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">yep</font>

871
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:12,679
anybody here use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google or Facebook</font>

872
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:15,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I think front likely still next</font>

873
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:17,200
and Rudolph<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cascadia I think one of the</font>

874
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:20,949
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be added to this</font>

875
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:25,519
thought process is the cost of deploying

876
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:29,269
v6 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of breakage and coming up</font>

877
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:32,289
with a three-tiered stool rather than a

878
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:34,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">two tiered stool that you have here and</font>

879
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:38,179
that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring some interesting</font>

880
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:41,408
conclusions with regard to the break

881
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:44,690
point between deploying v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs versus</font>

00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:46,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">twinks egn versus buying and that's</font>

883
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,169
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about</font>

884
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:50,029
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> two months ago but never got</font>

885
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:52,489
anywhere because regular work caught me

886
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:54,710
up with regular stuff I do have a

887
00:32:52,489 --> 00:32:57,320
section in the paper about the cost of

888
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:58,820
deploying ipv6 it is fairly hard to

889
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,789
calculate because it does vary so much

890
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:04,759
by what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of organization you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are I</font>

891
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:06,970
assert I think my assertion is that if

892
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:09,889
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a five-year deployment schedule</font>

893
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:11,749
get a time<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine if you have a</font>

894
00:33:09,889 --> 00:33:13,399
five-year deployment schedule then and

895
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:15,499
you have a five year depreciation cycle

896
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:17,119
then all of your non v6 capable hardware

897
00:33:15,499 --> 00:33:19,159
will depreciate over the course of your

898
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,320
basics deployment and your capex is

899
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:24,350
nothing you still have op<font color="#E5E5E5"> X but your op</font>

900
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,029
X is over five years it's whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

901
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:29,059
normal you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you go touch all of</font>

902
00:33:26,029 --> 00:33:31,009
your internal coded systems it's you

903
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:32,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">know add in some time to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> code v6 as well</font>

904
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:35,029
as whatever you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to add in for</font>

905
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:36,619
new features<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway and it's what five</font>

906
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:39,109
or ten percent so it's maybe not that

907
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:40,519
big a deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you compress the schedule</font>

908
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:42,259
then you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some hardware that</font>

909
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,419
isn't fully depreciated that you have to

910
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:46,369
replace before it's fully depreciated on

911
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:47,989
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand most hardware these days</font>

912
00:33:46,369 --> 00:33:50,059
actually dug depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on again we're</font>

913
00:33:47,989 --> 00:33:51,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about does Ford be six so i</font>

914
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:53,389
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the hardware you're missing</font>

915
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:56,869
is the cpe hardware there that's true

916
00:33:53,389 --> 00:34:00,168
and the costs associated with breakage

917
00:33:56,869 --> 00:34:02,779
when new CP comes in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> basics doesn't</font>

918
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:05,570
work as expected when devices try to use

919
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:07,129
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so now those three things are do you</font>

920
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:09,770
need me to cap the mics here we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

921
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:11,598
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> time well okay go ahead and front</font>

922
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:13,219
like I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this next no he is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

923
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,099
back might then it's like how Matthew

924
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:18,290
across from amazon I'll mark you down to

925
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:19,460
the Australian accent impression that

926
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">was pretty bad</font>

927
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:24,800
um depending on your economies view on

928
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,629
legal interception and so on if you're

929
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,669
owning see<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carrie great now you may have</font>

930
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:30,918
to be logging the data about the five

931
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:33,949
couple anyway so in fact the break-even

932
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:36,469
thing might in fact be a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of paying</font>

933
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:40,279
for that I don't want to reinforce

934
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:41,299
Jeff's fuse that feels dirty I that

935
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,980
that's absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> true if you're</font>

936
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:45,070
required by law to do it anyway then you

937
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:48,760
might as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a buck off of it yeah</font>

938
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:52,730
hi Patrick Gilmore Akamai as much as I

939
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:55,339
shudder to disagree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with such a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> steamed</font>

940
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,530
personnages Jeff I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

941
00:34:55,339 --> 00:34:59,710
everybody here who put your pre-cut fire

942
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:03,020
card in when you bought your nanog

943
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:04,190
registration I didn't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so everybody</font>

944
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,599
has a frequent flyer card I think I have

945
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:11,210
more miles and everybody in the room but

946
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">the point the point is things are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

947
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:15,290
actually worth point seven four cents

948
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,680
each time you spend a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of money that</font>

949
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:20,150
no one ever gives you any points on

950
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,680
nobody wants to your corner store

951
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,970
doesn't care about frequent<font color="#E5E5E5"> flier they</font>

952
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,919
don't want to know so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten thousand</font>

953
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:26,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">dollars you spent online it's very well</font>

954
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,460
tracked but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not every single store wants</font>

955
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,680
to know every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single thing so that's</font>

956
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually in a false equation you can't</font>

957
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,410
actually say well I spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dollar</font>

958
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:35,270
therefore I<font color="#E5E5E5"> get exactly that much money</font>

959
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:37,069
so you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much less</font>

960
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:39,800
you're going to get you've also talked

961
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:43,339
about things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like CG</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CDNs um I work for</font>

962
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,450
a small company called Akamai I don't

963
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:46,070
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling anybody that we're</font>

964
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:48,500
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay a premium for getting</font>

965
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:50,240
behind this CGN I never I've never told

966
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,670
a single person that and I've talked to

967
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,589
a lot of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room about cgm so</font>

968
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:57,680
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's many assumptions that</font>

969
00:35:54,589 --> 00:36:00,890
came out about see<font color="#E5E5E5"> James being a profit</font>

970
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,970
margin that don't actually hold now that

971
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,440
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that you're not going to</font>

972
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,810
get any money out of tracking people's

973
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,880
usage lots of companies do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

974
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:09,290
I mean even<font color="#CCCCCC"> Akamai has a product that</font>

975
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,300
helps you figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> where to target</font>

976
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:14,869
advertising so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a useful</font>

977
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:16,160
thing but you can't assume that $10,000

978
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:17,780
equals seven hundred forty bucks because

979
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,848
that is not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come close to</font>

980
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,890
the correct answer and you can't assume

981
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:23,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all cdns are going to pay to get</font>

982
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:25,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">behind the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CG in and you can't assume</font>

983
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:26,960
lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things so you've got a lot</font>

984
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,190
of assumptions on one end and you've got

985
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,830
a bad man telling you those assumptions

986
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,849
are wrong and I'm telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that not</font>

987
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,720
all of his assumptions are correct

988
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:36,960
either so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> general</font>

989
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,220
we have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> freakin clue right but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

990
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay because that's how we run the</font>

internet for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last 40 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

992
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:45,509
seemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually greatly</font>

993
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:47,310
reassured to hear your your push back on

994
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">the list ugh again that's the stuff that</font>

995
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:49,859
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't really been able to think</font>

996
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">through very long so you know three</font>

997
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:54,598
o'clock in the morning that's not my

998
00:36:51,270 --> 00:37:00,119
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> time Lee yes I have two quick</font>

999
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:03,300
questions first one is does the ISPs

1000
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,550
think that the consumer won't be able to

1001
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">make a choice between a dedicated ipv4</font>

1002
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:11,310
address and a nap so if they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

1003
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,980
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be tracked or they don't eat and it's</font>

1004
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:15,450
not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current users but people</font>

1005
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:20,849
who are making a decision where they

1006
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:23,129
might use Xbox or something else so it

1007
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:26,150
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's just assumed to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1008
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:28,790
way it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the second thing is</font>

1009
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:32,240
why do you believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by the end of</font>

1010
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:34,140
2014 the transition will be complete

1011
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,729
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting question let</font>

1012
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:39,029
me let me start with I would certainly

1013
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:41,369
not presume to speak on behalf of ISPs

1014
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:43,470
even one that I work for I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1015
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:44,339
presume to speak on behalf of them so

1016
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,560
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a really</font>

1017
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:49,049
interesting point is consumers might

1018
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,599
decide to choose the CGN for privacy

1019
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:53,490
reasons not just because it's a cheaper

1020
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,200
alternative I certainly hadn't done any

1021
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:56,368
breakdown on what the what the mix in

1022
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,180
uptake would be so that's an interesting

1023
00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:04,040
idea as far as deployment of v6 that's

1024
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:06,149
um uh yeah I saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I said is ISPs</font>

1025
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,650
behaving rationally and according to you

1026
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,510
know sort of their own contract renewal

1027
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:11,220
time would have it deployed to customers

1028
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,630
but I did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that consumer</font>

1029
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,549
electronics would be ready or that all

1030
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,830
websites or content would be ready that

1031
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,940
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the biggest problem</font>

1032
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest thing i think</font>

1033
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,690
holding back the deployment of ipv6 is

1034
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:25,260
that consumer electronics aren't ready

1035
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:28,320
and even when substantially all consumer

1036
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:30,420
electronics support ipv6 it will take

1037
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,369
years for the ones that don't to age out

1038
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:35,430
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network there may be some value</font>

1039
00:38:32,369 --> 00:38:36,990
of households that have only be six

1040
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:40,080
capable equipment that could live on a

1041
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:41,819
v6 only service if there's enough

1042
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,400
content that's on v6 but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1043
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:46,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have that density either so exactly</font>

1044
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">where and how that happens I would</font>

1045
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:51,360
love to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear more ideas for advancing</font>

1046
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:57,060
deployment very neat study yes more work

1047
00:38:51,360 --> 00:39:00,170
needs to be done middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> i see EG camera</font>

1048
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:03,240
and you see the club this is really

1049
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:05,850
really nice um I kind of did the math

1050
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,649
myself about a year ago not as good<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1051
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:10,799
this one so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go back</font>

1052
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:13,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">and do my math again but when I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did the</font>

1053
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,600
calculations for my<font color="#CCCCCC"> li work in a nice p</font>

1054
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">I did the calculations I came up the</font>

1055
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:20,940
number of a your 2015 I had to finish

1056
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:23,490
deploying v six hundred percent or I'm

1057
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:25,410
gonna start losing money so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font>

1058
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:29,640
that's a pretty close number<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1059
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:32,040
patina you came up with the one figure

1060
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,670
that I can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with was the</font>

1061
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:39,930
cost of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> innovation opportunities</font>

1062
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:41,970
that we would lose with czn I could not

1063
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:44,730
make that into numbers so I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1064
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:47,250
really interested if there was a way to

1065
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:49,500
you know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of make that a number and</font>

1066
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:52,350
so we could show that to our executives

1067
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,390
that's I have never been<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to figure</font>

1068
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">out a good way to quantify opportunity</font>

1069
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost either in terms of innovation or in</font>

1070
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of as you're deploying CGN or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6</font>

1071
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:04,649
even if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have along if you</font>

1072
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,910
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> started years ago and you're</font>

1073
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,350
still in the process of figuring out how

1074
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:09,029
you're going to do it you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1075
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:12,900
have to stop work on other products

1076
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:14,700
while you roll out v6 I you know I wish

1077
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,350
you'd started earlier yeah I agree

1078
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:21,350
thanks folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have time for one more</font>

1079
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:24,810
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks lave sawyer GCI alaska</font>

1080
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:28,440
MSO isp not speaking on<font color="#E5E5E5"> behalf of the</font>

1081
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:30,120
isp but as I suppose any<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp might do</font>

1082
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,000
there's another tier that you've

1083
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,759
forgotten I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think which is those users</font>

1084
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,500
wanting a static IP to always have that

1085
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,380
IP address available on the internet and

1086
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,390
you can provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> that both at the CGN</font>

1087
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:44,940
side right where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always have a</font>

1088
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:47,100
static translation or you can also have

1089
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,980
a static natural IP so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two</font>

1090
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,509
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas where you can monetize and I</font>

1091
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:56,010
think that might even touch on the other

1092
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:58,310
gentleman's a point about interesting

1093
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:58,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font>

1094
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:06,670
remote participant Derek Reese works for

1095
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,710
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP and made a comment that CGN makes</font>

1096
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,940
him nervous about customer experience he

1097
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,619
knows for a fact his company is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to charge a premium for a</font>

1099
00:41:11,619 --> 00:41:17,500
subscriber behind CGN<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I hope that</font>

1100
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:19,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">was as much fun good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope thats as</font>

1101
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,250
much for anybody else as it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me</font>

1102
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,420
I'm really you know I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font>

1103
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,410
thoughts as far as they can go and see

1104
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,710
where I can ended up so thank you all

1105

very much
