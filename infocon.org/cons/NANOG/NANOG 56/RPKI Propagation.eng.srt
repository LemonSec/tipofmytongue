<font color="#CCCCCC">alright welcome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back I hope you all had</font>

2
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:22,259
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good lunch and he's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get you</font>

3
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,538
folks in here and sit down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and be quiet</font>

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,720
and then we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting ready to get</font>

5
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:31,189
Randy to talk about measuring are picky

6
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:40,350
on our PK I that's difficult

7
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:42,899
repositories thanks Randy bush I jail um

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,079
they have all sorts of warnings on the

9
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,120
microphones etc to be civil<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beloit it</font>

10
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,270
to the center as if we normally weren't

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:59,608
well you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be with me just</font>

12
00:00:50,270 --> 00:01:01,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">be honest okay so just in case um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm an</font>

13
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,180
engineer and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> always think about the</font>

14
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,489
problems this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be about</font>

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,939
problems and I'm a researcher and we're

16
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,950
only interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems the rpki</font>

17
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,229
is actually going real well except in

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,159
America but I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the</font>

19
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:19,049
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and this was all done by</font>

20
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,119
friends and friends with the people that

21
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,090
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> are IRS who are doing this F</font>

22
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,840
etcetera but I am measuring what they're

23
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:31,200
doing first of all if you remember the

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,420
rpki infrastructure there's the

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,610
certificate hierarchy<font color="#CCCCCC"> etc the stuffs</font>

26
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,670
published in a repository the

27
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,820
repositories are gathered up yeah wrong

28
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">button backwards oh I can do it are</font>

29
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:49,740
gathered up in a cache and then fed to

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,869
the router and I'm concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

31
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:58,560
router of course and my routing relies

32
00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:01,860
upon these repositories so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning</font>

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,380
to worry a lot and of course the

34
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:09,000
software that<font color="#CCCCCC"> feeds the router the cash</font>

35
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I control is if the people are</font>

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,890
smart designed so it's very resilient

37
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,810
keeps etc but

38
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look at the current publication</font>

39
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:22,590
hierarchy it's pretty scary<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there's</font>

40
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,959
not much operational quality in it and

41
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:29,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">this has to be fixed these graphs are</font>

42
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,500
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source software we do and</font>

43
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:35,730
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web page for you you can look</font>

44
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:40,860
at it and so here's for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> in isp</font>

45
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:42,510
and there's how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even see</font>

46
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">the slide that I'm pointing to but</font>

47
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:49,590
anyway yes but I can't point there so

48
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:51,660
how many how long it takes to fetch<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

49
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,410
repository<font color="#E5E5E5"> from them how many objects</font>

50
00:02:51,660 --> 00:03:01,050
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> etc um and those are fairly</font>

51
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:03,870
reasonable<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good the</font>

52
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,780
actual fetching which you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see on 3</font>

53
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:12,660
July is pretty good but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look you</font>

54
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:18,390
can see certificate errors so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

55
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:21,450
have a multi-day outage and can anybody

56
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:27,000
guess what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the early</font>

57
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:30,109
beginning of July somebody got it Jeff

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,500
wins the prize the leap second so anyway

59
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:37,620
the problem is this rir doesn't have

60
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,620
knock they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not work weekends and I</font>

61
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,470
had to call an engineer inside and he

62
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,410
got it fixed within a few minutes once

63
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,829
they knew it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was bad so we're not</font>

64
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,209
monitoring this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rife was</font>

65
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,230
pretty good they stayed up across the

66
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">leap second but they've had can they had</font>

67
00:03:54,230 --> 00:04:00,840
continuous fetch failures which we can

68
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,840
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little more closely where we</font>

69
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,680
expand<font color="#E5E5E5"> this out and this is I tried to</font>

70
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,410
fetch from them and couldn't fetch gun

71
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,940
errors so what was the problem we

72
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally got down to it we were logging</font>

73
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,440
it all the time it was NFS which is a

74
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,029
disgusting protocol and you should never

75
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:23,700
use it um it went<font color="#E5E5E5"> on for months nothing</font>

76
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,429
can be wrong at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR it's fine it's</font>

77
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,210
fine it's fine your measurements are bad

78
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:30,030
finally

79
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,849
went around<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the back door to the</font>

80
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,219
actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> ops people and they fixed it</font>

81
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:38,009
small problems still remain so three

82
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,470
weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago oops let's see where's the</font>

83
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:43,110
back button three weeks ago here was a

84
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:46,319
migration<font color="#E5E5E5"> at ripe so that's what we</font>

85
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:50,130
expect still some errors so things are a

86
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:53,610
lot better now but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rio no I'd love</font>

87
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one here is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> afrinic for those folks</font>

88
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,889
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually use unix which I hope is</font>

89
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,960
most of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at those perms aren't</font>

90
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,570
they lovely you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

91
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,750
very often right that's a privilege

92
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,610
remember it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay by the way when we</font>

93
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,130
wrote to the multiple times we received

94
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,500
snarky responses<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how we should</font>

95
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">have pointed this out to them and who we</font>

96
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,400
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have pointed it out to and so on</font>

97
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:21,509
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth fix it that's another</font>

98
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,120
problem so the rirs are effectively like

99
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:28,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">PT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> T's they went to ptc school there are</font>

100
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:31,830
no problems right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the software itself</font>

101
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,320
has to take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this and it does it</font>

102
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:36,300
uses old data if it can't fetch<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew all</font>

103
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,060
those wonderful things so it's fairly

104
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:44,659
stable and the rpki data don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

105
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:47,490
frequently but the you can't run

106
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:50,969
operations a global operation with that

107
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:53,729
kind of reliability issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> um and if you</font>

108
00:05:50,969 --> 00:06:00,780
want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really scared remember ripes</font>

109
00:05:53,729 --> 00:06:05,280
um five-day inadar outage and there was

110
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:07,109
a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> post-mortem on it and um we're</font>

111
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,030
trying to make silk purse out of sows

112
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,750
ears it's not that the rirs our sows

113
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,669
ears but they are our bookkeepers you

114
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,699
don't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bookkeeper to run a</font>

115
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:21,180
reliable server you ask them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the</font>

116
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:23,310
books well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so here are some</font>

117
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,860
positives one positive slide on

118
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,719
statistics this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the number of objects</font>

119
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,469
in each repository and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

120
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:34,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">point out ripe that is wonderful they</font>

121
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:39,009
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> now something like 1,500 members</font>

122
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:44,529
have registered objects<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

123
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:47,379
thank you let us know go back to it ok

124
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:49,449
so the deployment is serious in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ripe</font>

125
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:54,149
region it's really good Alex and Tim are

126
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:56,439
doing a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> job rirs are not operators</font>

127
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:59,649
JP nick is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to set an</font>

128
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:01,779
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see but the software works</font>

129
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:05,639
around it we need more measurement and

130
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:08,349
monitoring so where we go from here

131
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,559
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the publishers to provide five</font>

132
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:14,649
nines is silly the Internet's about

133
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:18,370
building reliable network from

134
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:22,649
unreliable components so we need to

135
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:25,749
develop protocols and a deployment model

136
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:30,699
based on distributed and cooperative

137
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:33,870
protocols to get service<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> resilience</font>

138
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:39,430
and diversity and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on that</font>

139
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:43,509
so second half of this talk is so we've

140
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:47,199
got this<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpki thing the publishes so I</font>

141
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:50,349
can get my<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff in my router but it's</font>

142
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,550
relying on all those publication points

143
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:56,680
etc in a large<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP deployment all these</font>

144
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,979
caches will be to fetch fetching from

145
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:05,279
the publication points<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok we're going to</font>

146
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:10,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a laser show to come on music</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> music</font>

147
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:13,719
so um in this you know I'm relying on

148
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:15,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">these publication points and then I'm</font>

149
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:18,399
pulling them down to caches that I

150
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:20,529
distribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my network etc so what are</font>

151
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">these cash is going to perform like and</font>

152
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:24,759
and what's the reliability there and

153
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,919
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> their pardon me what's the</font>

154
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,649
propagation time what's the propagation

155
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:32,588
time and the deployment so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

156
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:36,370
propagation characteristics of the

157
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:40,839
infrastructure how<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitive is that two</font>

158
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:45,240
timers how much is propagation how much

159
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:47,800
is validation and what's it like in

160
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,260
latency in the network how does that

161
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">affect it so let's remember there's a</font>

162
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:55,329
publication hierarchy there's the iono

163
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:58,480
is the rirs etc etc and all our

164
00:08:55,329 --> 00:09:01,599
wonderful<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs below them I just want to</font>

165
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">point out some players in the game these</font>

166
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:09,069
these are the publication points which

167
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:11,680
is Diana and the rirs etc then I

168
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:14,290
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the top of my tier 1 have</font>

169
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,989
some gatherers who fetch directly from

170
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,599
those publication points but I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

171
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:24,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep the load down on them so I have</font>

172
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:27,879
caches<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok that feed from the gatherers</font>

173
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:30,579
not from the publication points<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

174
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:33,220
and I might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> also published my own</font>

175
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:39,339
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I've got routers who feed</font>

176
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:41,410
off the caches ok so the cash gets the

177
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:46,300
data from the publication points or

178
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:49,870
other caches every cash has the root

179
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:52,870
trust anchor this is an object security

180
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:58,120
model so every cash can validate all the

181
00:09:52,870 --> 00:10:01,300
data itself ok so somebody lies to it

182
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,560
it's fine the propagation time is from

183
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:10,449
parent down to child in the hierarchy um

184
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:16,388
and we measure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it by having everything</font>

185
00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:18,069
log when it receives things<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok the</font>

186
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:20,670
architecture is we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care</font>

187
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:23,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">about robbers in this measurement model</font>

188
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,149
because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just care about when the data</font>

189
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">gets to the routers we don't care about</font>

190
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:31,240
what they do with it so we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

191
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:34,810
a fake router which does nothing but

192
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:39,160
receive the data and log and the cash is

193
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:45,790
all also log and so here's a part of the

194
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:49,839
model um and we have the route we have

195
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:53,649
the rirs we have those gatherers we have

196
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:58,589
tier<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2s we have tier 3 etc all with</font>

197
00:10:53,649 --> 00:11:03,100
caches routers so on and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok and</font>

198
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:04,930
we have a test bed<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's the numbers</font>

199
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,100
i'll show you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be from a single</font>

200
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,489
Tier one each

201
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:12,180
has three gatherers there are 60 or tues

202
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:15,040
for every tier<font color="#CCCCCC"> one so on and so forth</font>

203
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't we actually have a thing with</font>

204
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,779
about a thousand machines but right now

205
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:22,660
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 300 machines</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

206
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:25,449
300 caches and routers and how the heck

207
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:29,439
do you deploy that you use a cluster and

208
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:33,699
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using cluster that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Japan yeah</font>

209
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:36,540
Jase JEP an<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know but it's</font>

210
00:11:33,699 --> 00:11:39,099
research lab up in northern Japan

211
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,529
cooperates with what Doug lon was

212
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,440
talking about they've got a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> k</font>

213
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:48,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">VMs by the way a thousand thousand big</font>

214
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:51,959
machines um you can't configure 300

215
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:55,139
servers by hand so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

216
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:59,709
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called autonet kit and</font>

217
00:11:55,139 --> 00:12:02,170
what we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we draw literally on your</font>

218
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:04,000
macbook air using something called<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

219
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:14,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">ad which is a nice graphical thing which</font>

220
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:16,899
produces graph ml<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and you draw this</font>

221
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:19,149
you produce graph ml and it actually

222
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:21,220
builds the server configurations and we

223
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:26,470
deploy the Monstar bed<font color="#CCCCCC"> jewness fear etc</font>

224
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:28,360
yes really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is automated okay so low</font>

225
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,880
net kid was originally came from roma

226
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,880
roma tre you know Lorenzo who's helped

227
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">start it down there Stefano etc oh and</font>

228
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,430
then it got hacked in Adelaide

229
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:41,620
University by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Simon night but</font>

230
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:45,758
then take taken further at loughborough

231
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:48,269
university by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ian Debian Olaf and the</font>

232
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:51,009
enhancements going on at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Loughborough</font>

233
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:54,880
autonet kid is you see it and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

234
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:56,800
by the way last week<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco admitted</font>

235
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,720
using it and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help provide</font>

236
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,258
it to you to replace dynamics and all

237
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,649
that stuff address assignment was poor

238
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:07,439
needed servers and rpki knowledge and

239
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:11,490
all that so we hacked it up seriously

240
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:14,649
and when we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to delay to test our TT</font>

241
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:18,220
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually took the network and we ran</font>

242
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:19,279
it we ran the packets from the cash in

243
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,959
star bed

244
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:28,519
to virtual<font color="#CCCCCC"> jewness fiercer routers in</font>

245
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:32,149
dallas texas and back and so we could

246
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:36,769
induce 300 to 500 ms delay any point we

247
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:39,860
wanted in the virtual network and so hey

248
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:43,309
if we when you see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two tier ones</font>

249
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:45,199
here see this one has dots that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means it</font>

250
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:48,589
went to Dallas and back to get between

251
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:52,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">those two points this is one without</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT</font>

252
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:56,870
with that all within star bed<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

253
00:13:52,279 --> 00:14:03,980
this has delay all over the place no

254
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:08,629
significant effect so home we ran fairly

255
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:13,399
large scale we put the delay as you saw

256
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:16,370
both between groups between the

257
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:18,529
publication points and the gatherers and

258
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:22,689
gatherers and the caches and caches and

259
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:25,160
the routers no significant effect<font color="#CCCCCC"> rtt</font>

260
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:27,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and it's because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're things</font>

261
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,410
aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really doing much ok it's just</font>

262
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:32,920
slopping big stuff in big chunks over

263
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:36,610
the network so the cash deployment

264
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:39,860
architecture you build for global<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP</font>

265
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,899
don't worry too much about caches in

266
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:50,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">North America getting stuff from Europe</font>

267
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:52,309
or Asia and vice versa<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I'm going</font>

268
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,800
to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little more about the</font>

269
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:58,389
emulation structure and how we allocated

270
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:02,899
things but we will we had to

271
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:05,870
artificially talk about what the higher

272
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:08,329
k but the certificate hierarchy was etc

273
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:11,230
because we can't generate when we would

274
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:14,569
love to generate a believable

275
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:19,670
certificate and row<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hierarchy from a</font>

276
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:22,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP table dump anybody who can do</font>

277
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:26,839
algorithms to do that we will buy you a

278
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:28,910
two or three star dinner that's a

279
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,100
serious prize out there waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for some</font>

280
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,630
computer scientists<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know three or four</font>

281
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have already</font>

282
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:40,160
seriously working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that it this is a</font>

283
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:43,880
non-trivial problem so we did one CA and

284
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:48,170
one row of per entity about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7500 or</font>

285
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:51,860
added during the run so what we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we</font>

286
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:58,160
build this on the laptop we deploy it on

287
00:15:51,860 --> 00:16:00,080
star bed it then generates start we hit

288
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,839
the start button and it starts

289
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,540
generating and distributing the rowers

290
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:09,260
down to the cash for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the existing stuff</font>

291
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:11,750
it was initialized with and then we

292
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:16,040
start feeding stuff into it one per

293
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:18,350
second in real time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> takes about</font>

two hours to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the testa to</font>

299
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:39,620
so it runs for about a day produces

300
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:44,270
about three gig of logs and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

303
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:56,209
the publication points once an hour so

304
00:16:51,970 --> 00:17:00,620
ideally fifty percent of the samples

305
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:03,290
would have a time of 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes this is</font>

310
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:20,030
initially drop the stuff on to star bed

311
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:24,079
and then we hit the button and it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

312
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:26,629
distribute that stuff to the caches up a

318
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,530
a no surprise presentation and we like

319
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,179
that it means the protocols are pretty

320
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:50,149
good

321
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:54,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay here it is with steady state flow</font>

322
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:57,950
once we shoved it shove the initial load

323
00:17:54,590 --> 00:18:00,320
out now we trickle it out notice it take

324
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:02,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a little closer you're on flicking</font>

325
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:06,379
back and forth it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little better</font>

326
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:09,010
because it doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this big load to</font>

327
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">do and it can trickle them reasonably</font>

328
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:14,090
okay so now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data at the</font>

329
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,810
gatherers how long does it take<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

330
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:20,270
two routers again it's not to go back

331
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:22,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">and forth it's not that different not</font>

332
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:25,639
that works much worse and then the

333
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:29,540
steady state flow to the routers it's

334
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the same okay we trying a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">torrent a reasonable BitTorrent run</font>

00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:48,020
before now okay and that is this one and

341
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:50,660
as thanks to star bed as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said DHS</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">course the goals thank you the goal is</font>

to of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course make bgp convergence faster</font>

352
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:38,690
so here's the measurement we did we took

353
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:43,790
and we put we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to shine some light</font>

354
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:46,430
on the subject um to a sr 1 k's on a

355
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:50,480
wire with a mirroring switch between so

356
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:52,730
this is just a land for the switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

we measured<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP session pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

361
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:09,310
stuff here's time sequence plots oh

362
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:11,060
you're showing that PDF not the

363
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:13,790
powerpoints so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have this</font>

364
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:16,970
all on one slide sorry for those people

00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:18,320
who don't remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP 101 and to tell</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you the truth I hadn't played in this</font>

367
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,480
field for 18 years and so I had fun

368
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:27,290
learning re learning a lot of stuff here

369
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a segment being sent bunch of packets</font>

00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,909
this is the segment counter how many

375
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:55,910
the advertised window help the receiver

376
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:59,120
says how many bytes I can swallow in one

377
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:00,920
chunk and the sender says here's what I

378
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:07,129
can do this is known<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the congestion</font>

379
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:12,110
window<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so warning the pictures you're</font>

380
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:14,750
going to see the tool i use the scales a

381
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,729
little arbitrary and it's it so don't

382
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:22,370
read too much into what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you visually see</font>

383
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:26,180
see the numbers here is we're seeing the

384
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:30,469
congestion window is being stuffed by

385
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:33,290
the advertised window so the advertised

386
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,690
window is limiting how much can be sent

387
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:38,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">the reach so that's saying the receiver</font>

388
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:42,650
is choking how much can be sent at any

389
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:46,610
one time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll get number shortly so the</font>

00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:50,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">rtt we focused immediately here we are</font>

391
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:57,620
on a wire and we have the 75th

00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:07,040
a wire not good so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dog we</font>

mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is working on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with us in</font>

399
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:21,380
fact they initiated the project I mean

400
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:25,629
there are a number of you sitting out

401
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:29,929
there with bgp sessions with a

402
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:32,630
million-plus um routes in it for VPNs

403
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:34,490
etc so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want that stuff faster so</font>

404
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:36,320
since goes working hard on this so

405
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:40,340
you've seen just to work in progress by

406
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,769
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we see oh there's one</font>

407
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,279
act for an entire window this is known

408
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:49,880
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> stretch act could this be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem</font>

409
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:54,620
so there's also occasionally a loss and

410
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:58,340
a retransmit but not often ok so is

411
00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:01,279
stretch<font color="#E5E5E5"> act the problem it could lead to</font>

412
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:04,639
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rtts it does could make things</font>

413
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:06,710
bursty and it could cause us the<font color="#E5E5E5"> diverse</font>

414
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:11,240
can be overwhelming<font color="#CCCCCC"> assent transmit</font>

415
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:15,919
buffer there's also the small advertised

416
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:19,789
window due to constraints in antique

417
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:24,500
routers the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual buffers are small so</font>

418
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:27,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">32k is all you get for an advertised</font>

419
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:31,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">firfer buffer so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the advertised</font>

420
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:34,100
window and what you really like is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

421
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,799
bandwidth delay product but that's life

422
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:42,110
in the big city so we increased the

423
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:44,389
advertised window size no win<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

425
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:54,428
no real big win we remove the stretch

426
00:23:47,029 --> 00:24:02,080
act still 115<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mills ok rtt is still high</font>

427
00:23:54,429 --> 00:24:04,789
we drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok cisco iOS which is XE has</font>

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,949
doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real tasking model it</font>

429
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:09,919
does what embedded systems do which has

430
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:13,639
run to completion there's a task queue

431
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:16,880
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> running but I promised to</font>

432
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:20,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">check with in n milliseconds and if that</font>

433
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:23,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">timers up i relinquish and put myself on</font>

434
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:25,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> task on the to be resumed q ok so</font>

435
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:29,240
it's all voluntary

436
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:34,810
we are TC normal ease 50 milliseconds we

437
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:38,720
dropped it to 25 and cut the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rtt in half</font>

438
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:40,730
so you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> wow a task a real tasking</font>

439
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,200
system like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux is going to make this</font>

440
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:48,860
all wonderful haha<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a dirty trick</font>

441
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:51,860
you get an attack from layer 9 the layer

442
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:55,399
9 attack is a router vendor is

443
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:59,810
implementing this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they don't</font>

444
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:04,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">look that the Linux kernel has the GPL</font>

445
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:08,179
poison so I can't put my critical code

446
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:11,690
in the colonel so I have to swap out to

447
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,970
use your space and guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that costs</font>

448
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:16,550
we haven't seriously measured but the

449
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:21,650
last slide will show you an alarm there

450
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:24,080
that says same problem there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> RTC is</font>

451
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:27,590
something you can tune by the way

452
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:30,770
observe that little right there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

453
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:34,699
can go set that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get it as low as</font>

454
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:39,170
20 and really cut your<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT RTC's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

455
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:41,450
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT on your ACK ok what if it's the</font>

456
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP stack what if there's a 6 stack</font>

457
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,830
these stacks haven't been seriously

458
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:50,480
hacked in 10 years so let's measure a

459
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:53,780
non bgp protocol now remember routers go

460
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,800
can do the rpki router protocol which is

461
00:25:53,780 --> 00:26:00,080
this nice slick<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp protocol there we</font>

462
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,510
see it it's beautiful this is the

463
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:08,179
servers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> dallas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the client is in</font>

464
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:11,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">seattle we see a 78 millisecond</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT</font>

465
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:13,970
that's all due to distance and look at

466
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,130
them nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> big windows opening up</font>

467
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,560
chunking along i mean the window size is

468
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:22,100
the limited but because of buffering but

469
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:25,550
that's the way you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> a TC TC p so the</font>

470
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:28,340
stack looks good<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really looks</font>

471
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:31,070
good so the windows a little small but

472
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:33,560
that's life in the big city right or in

473
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:37,409
the little router right there still

474
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:42,060
saving<font color="#CCCCCC"> RAM in 2012</font>

475
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:47,310
um so is it bgp or it could be rib to

476
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:51,649
fib remember that problem so we take it

477
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:54,300
and we reset the<font color="#E5E5E5"> receiving bgp receiver</font>

478
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:56,820
has a policy statement that just drops

479
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,980
through the bgp announcement on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

480
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:01,710
floor instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best path and</font>

481
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:05,610
stuffing it in the fib fifty percent

482
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:09,270
savings so fifty percent of your dollars

483
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:10,949
are being spent still 15 years after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

484
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:14,100
first research showed this was a problem

485
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:20,040
still moving stuff down this thin little

486
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:23,550
straw to the fib<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the two big</font>

487
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:26,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem so far we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can hit is run to</font>

488
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:29,370
completion timer rib to fit we can get

489
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:32,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">rid of the stretch act that do lot open</font>

490
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:36,989
the window better<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we have two big</font>

491
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:39,930
opportunities so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want this is</font>

492
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:43,200
XE we really want to measure XR during

493
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:46,440
the experiment we actually accidentally

494
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,750
measured XR because I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see when</font>

495
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,910
I was measuring the rpki protocol from

496
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">seattle to dallas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said hey I've gotten</font>

497
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:56,850
an XR machine in dallas<font color="#E5E5E5"> right next to</font>

498
00:27:52,860 --> 00:28:03,810
the server let's try that what we got

499
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:07,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">was something very strange fast</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT but</font>

500
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:10,409
the window size<font color="#E5E5E5"> was only one segment</font>

501
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:14,700
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> scary so something is wrong in</font>

502
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:18,360
there in stack etc we will play with it

503
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:20,250
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out and in the I still have</font>

504
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,810
two minutes remaining and I don't have

505
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">another presentation to fit into that</font>

506
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">smallest lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cheers</font>

507
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:43,410
come on no questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our Andy no</font>

508
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,410
I'll coward get off
