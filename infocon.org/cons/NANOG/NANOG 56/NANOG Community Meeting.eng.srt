relevance and neutrality in the long

56
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:43,810
term we're striving to reach both what

57
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,359
we call mid-career and early career

58
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,760
network operators that means getting

59
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:51,790

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,720
organization's relevance through

65
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,369
memberships so attracting new members to

66
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,019
the organization giving them to pay the

67
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,019
fees and participate that way

68
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,728
this slide sort of highlights some of

69
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,180
our goals that we've set for ourselves

70
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:27,780
over the last few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and looking</font>

71
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">forward to the future so on the far left</font>

72
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,729
those were<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of our short-term goals</font>

73
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:37,660
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> previous groups of meetings so</font>

nanog 52 to 54 we talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know</font>

75
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:44,889
financial stability sustainability I

76
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:47,070
mean and so on the mid the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mid section</font>

77
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:50,830
there is sort of where we're at today

78
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:54,099
again we're still focused on maintaining

79
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:57,609
financial health continuing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to increase</font>

80

166
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,730
or one of us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in the past we</font>

167
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:06,400
we generally had had it was the case

168
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">that hosts were sort of local to the</font>

169
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,870
cities but but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no longer really a</font>

170
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,940
requirement we can be a host from

171
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,710
anywhere and host one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> namak</font>

172
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,390
meetings it's really not a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

173
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:21,130
us that the planning is much more

174
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:24,040
streamlined now so it's very easy and as

175
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:25,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide shows 61-62</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where we're</font>

176
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:30,040
working on those but we're not ready to

177
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:34,020
announce those yet that's eight of my

178
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,020
section Mike

179
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:49,220
so how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people here by show of hands</font>

180
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:55,880
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> already members and just for</font>

181
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:58,370
comparison how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

182
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,630
reason i ask is because the first part

183
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,800
of this slide where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i talk about the</font>

184
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,550
quarterly information that's available

185
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,260
for members through arrow which is our

186
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:10,040
web portal for all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information that</font>

187
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,600
we gather as a board so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

188
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,279
view these and I mean who wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

189
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,210
to look at an an audit report<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

190
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">amazing tax returns pnl budget all are</font>

191
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,990
there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I strongly recommend being a</font>

192
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,350
member so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can enjoy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

193
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:27,260
documents along with us one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did</font>

194
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,060
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say as a board we were very</font>

195
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,310
concerned with being transparent and

196
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,660
also fiscally responsible and so what we

197
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,040
decided to do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our first year is</font>

198
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,390
actually have an independent auditor

199
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,319
come in and take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at our books and</font>

200
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,350
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we were doing things</font>

201
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:43,930
correctly and it turns out we were which

202
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:46,670
is we were quite happy to see and as

203
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:48,500
Dwayne already mentioned we had set for

204
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,329
2013 that we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually going to have</font>

205
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,310
250,000 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reserve and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've already</font>

206
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:55,820
met that number and so what we're

207
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:58,010
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for now go forward from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cash</font>

208
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,900
flow management perspective is to have

209
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,760
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> in reserve to cover two meetings</font>

210
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,350
and then we're also looking at any of

211
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,779
the liabilities that we have outstanding

212
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,250
and as you saw from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting list we</font>

213
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:08,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to make decisions and sign</font>

214
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,940
contracts about hotels well in advance

215
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,510
of the meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

216
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,770
a buffer so that if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any issues</font>

217
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:19,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">with those contracts were able to cover</font>

218
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:20,630
them without any problems and as I'm

219
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,219
sure a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron was</font>

220
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,500
gracious enough in the very beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

221
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">this to lend us some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the seed money</font>

222
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,589
that really helped us jump start from

223
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,959
the transition period into being fully

224
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:34,370
independent<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana org again the</font>

225
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,160
expectation was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

226
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">pay that off by the end of 2013 but</font>

227
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually our last payment of $25,000</font>

228
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:45,580
will be taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> care of right around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

229
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this meeting yeah</font>

230
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,790
so what that means is really we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

231
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,500
debt going forward we have excellent

232
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:57,099
cash flow our balance sheet looks good

233
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's it's been great being the</font>

269
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:07,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">question at this point of how to fund it</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward and whether we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

funding that through<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sock helping them</font>

273
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,429
solicit more donors or whether this is

274
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:20,579
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should take in house</font>

275
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:23,069
at nanog and fund ourselves or solicit

276
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:25,890
donors to nag for that so we will be

277
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:30,750
exploring that probably at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font>

278
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:34,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">community meeting in Orlando and then</font>

280
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,569
meeting I presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very rough</font>

281
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:44,250
proposal to do an educational program

282
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:45,660
where Nana would present classes to you

283
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,940
know early to<font color="#CCCCCC"> mid career network</font>

284
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,770
operators or perhaps college students or

285
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:53,220
someone like that and you know basically

286
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:56,370
expand nanog straining role so since

287
00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:01,560
then we've said since then we've formed

288
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:03,300
a committee to explore you know what

289
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,099
that program ought to look like more and

290
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,449
we've got several people<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

291
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,460
committee I think I had a slide

292
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,950
originally listing the committee members

293
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,450
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that got taken out for the sake of</font>

294
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,490
saving time so I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to</font>

295
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">go through here and remember the list</font>

296
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,800
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to forget a bunch of</font>

297
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">people but I know several of the</font>

298
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,750
committee members are in the room<font color="#E5E5E5"> now so</font>

299
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,880
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> we went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into this with you</font>

300
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,490
know very broad goals bring people into

301
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,960
nanog and you know some models of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

302
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,600
programs that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> already have at</font>

303
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">apricot f</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nog San nag me nog and other</font>

304
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,010
organizations like that and we've been

305
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,720
discussing how to make this more you

306
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:40,020
know more appropriate<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog</font>

307
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,000
community so what we've come up with so

308
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,730
far this is still in very early stages

309
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,140
and we're targeting having a we're

310
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,920
targeting having a more concrete

311
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:51,449
proposal for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next nanog meeting but</font>

312
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,370
for the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've defined</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our target</font>

313
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,860
market down to early career network

314
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:58,710
operators which is nanog natural

315
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,630
community and you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is both a</font>

316
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,760
way to you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> help our own community</font>

317
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:04,410
by you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> training people and also a</font>

318
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,200
way to bring new people into nanog

319
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,610
because these are you know the people

320
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,510
who are obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ugh members if we</font>

321
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:14,400
can give them reason to come here we are

322
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,810
not going forward with the program<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

323
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,180
college students at this point just

324
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:20,010
because it seems better to take on one

325
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">pig at a time so that maybe something</font>

326
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:25,230
will come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to later depending on how</font>

327
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:27,390
the first phase of this goes we've done

328
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about format and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

329
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,960
know whether we wanted to do this is a

330
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:33,150
week long thing like they do and a lot

331
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,010
of other parts of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world or</font>

332
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:38,400
whether to keep this in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple hours</font>

333
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:40,920
like the current Nanak tutorials and had

334
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,870
a bunch of discussions about how much

335
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,930
time people could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get away from work how</font>

336
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,910
much you know how much time was

337
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:50,069
necessary to really you know impart

338
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,360
useful knowledge and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much was too</font>

339
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:54,360
much because people would start zoning

340
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,920
out and two days seemed like a decent

341
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,690
compromise at least for the first couple

342
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:03,240
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times to try it out and see how that</font>

343
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:04,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">goes we had discussions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about focus</font>

344
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,900
areas and we've come up with basically

345
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:10,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to limit it to operator specific</font>

346
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:12,030
network issues and you know which would

347
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">be more things along the lines of how</font>

348
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:16,649
you operate a you know a service

349
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,270
provider network and less of here's how

350
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:19,440
you configure a router because there are

351
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,910
plenty of places where people can

352
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,910
already go to be taught how to configure

353
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:26,580
routers and we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with the idea of</font>

354
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,830
starting with 2 2day what we're calling

355
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:33,720
foundation classes covering some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

356
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:36,240
basics of network operations so the the

357
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,970
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> classes at least class titles that</font>

358
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,470
we've outlined so far our battle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

359
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,440
abilities reliability maintainability

360
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,000
and scalability and then the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

361
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,730
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a network troubleshooting class</font>

362
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,550
and so what's next we have a committee

363
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:56,100
member who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is working on class outlines</font>

364
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:58,919
for you know what exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> these classes</font>

365
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,439
should cover we've got some people

366
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on financial models for how to</font>

367
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,190
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for these how much should be tuition</font>

368
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">and how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much should be grant money how</font>

369
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">much we're gonna have to pay the</font>

370
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:12,300
instructors and you know that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

371
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:14,340
thing and were as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said hoping to have</font>

372
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:18,389
a firmer proposal ready to present<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

373
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:20,159
Orlando<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know where this is</font>

374
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,950
obviously something we haven't done

375
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,900
before and you know we're still happy to

376
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:30,660
have more input so if you would like to

377
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:33,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you have any suggestions either come</font>

378
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:37,200

379
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,510
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the open mic time here or also you</font>

380
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,190
know if you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put time into</font>

381
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,020
this on a more sustained basis and would

382
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,120
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> join our committee please let me</font>

383
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,040
know

384
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:51,889

expected of a pc member what's expected

415
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:33,710
of a DC member and a communications

416
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,900
committee member this is new this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

417
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:39,260
first time that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> published these</font>

418
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:41,330
requirements we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> gathers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

419
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,640
exactly are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing let's put that down</font>

420
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:46,129
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> paper so that when we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to recruit</font>

expected so we hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you find this</font>

423
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:55,870
useful and why should you care you

424
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,990
should totally care about

425
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:01,449
nog nanog is a great opportunity for

426
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:04,059
networking and it's also a great

427
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:06,370

468
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,070
have made it grow to the point where I

469

<font color="#E5E5E5">the pleasure of being a PC member i was</font>

00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,689
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the time thought we'd be in as</font>

good of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> position as we are now the</font>

499

so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much involved for</font>

00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,990
quite a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font>

00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:45,380
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> that involvement and</font>

00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:47,330
contribution as a board member one of

00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:50,870
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i really feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I can</font>

541
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:52,760
contribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our organization</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that I</font>

542
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,879
do have a fair amount of marketing

543
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:58,610
background I do have excuse me have

544
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:02,840
sales experience and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

545
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:05,479
important not necessarily obviously I'm

546
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,100
never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be speaking during the</font>

547
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,340
general sessions or anything along the

548
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,740
lines of a technical talk but the

549
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:15,800
importance comes in when it comes to the

550
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:19,520
continuity of our organization there

551
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:22,580
needs to be some type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of experience or</font>

552
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,910
someone that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has an ability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able</font>

553
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:29,960
to talk to the sponsors talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> their speak</font>

554
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:32,500
so to say and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of balance out what</font>

555
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,480
their needs are as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand</font>

556
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,340
what they need and this is very

557
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,410
important because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about revenue</font>

558
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:42,980
generation this is about bringing in the

559
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:45,580
dollars that help operate our meetings

560
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:48,650
during the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nano meetings and then also</font>

561
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:52,550
the revenue<font color="#E5E5E5"> that needs to be generated</font>

562
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:58,970
for operations for Betty's group the AMS

563
00:27:52,550 --> 00:28:01,580
group so that's basically clearly the

564
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:05,480
importance of the revenue generation

565
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:07,100
stream for nanog currently I don't

566
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,370
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's anybody on the board</font>

the industry roughly 20 years which

579
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:59,270
seems kind of hard to believe at this

reviewed and evaluated whether or not

the naps were successful in

pretty well and it was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> unanimous</font>

for smaller ISPs to exchange traffic

locally opposite some of their transit

<font color="#E5E5E5">set as I've been making sausage for</font>

was the communications committee chair

647
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:03,030
when Steve Feldman called me and said do

648

you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be part of the Cabal and I</font>

649
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:10,590
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and then so started building</font>

650
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:12,060
servers making things happen kind of at

651
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:15,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> low levels to make sure that you</font>

652
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:17,940
know all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> successful and then</font>

653
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:19,500
moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> into kind of building the business</font>

654
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,090
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that that would be</font>

655
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">successful and so with the help of some</font>

656
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:25,230
very key individuals Joe provo included

657
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:27,630
we spent a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hours building the</font>

658
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:29,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">proforma that showed that we could</font>

changes that we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that you will</font>

687
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:05,870
run out of time but we will take a

to do this in a spare time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

691
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,690
what's posted on the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i invite</font>

you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it but Steve will give</font>

693
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:24,109
you the context play again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you made me</font>

694
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,790
actually look these up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember what</font>

695
00:34:24,109 --> 00:34:29,598
they were even though I wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so</font>

696
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:32,270
there's three amendments proposed the

697
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,919
first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to allow interim elections</font>

698
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,560
right now the bylaws say that we can

00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">only have elections in October we came</font>

700
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,279
to realize as we were going through this

701
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:41,929
process that that's not enough it means

702
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,109
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever we don't do this time we</font>

00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:46,129
can't get to for a hold of the year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

704
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:47,598
with the biological visions that we

705
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:49,699
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do we figured any incremental</font>

706
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,619
approach is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> better where we</font>

707
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:53,149

712
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:06,410
mostly just bookkeeping but it changes

724
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:36,989
is to restore board members<font color="#CCCCCC"> and officers</font>

read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all if you go to the website and</font>

737
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:07,279
that's pretty much it unless anybody has

hi who in the room has submitted a talk

745
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:54,200
at any point in time<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and that out</font>

746
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:58,220
just raise your hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's a pretty</font>

747
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:00,379
good good ratio so I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're all</font>

748
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:02,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">aware you've all been interacted with</font>

749
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:06,110
the program committee one way or another

750
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,060
we've hopefully accepted your talks we

751
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:12,460
may have rejected them and you know in

752
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:16,029
arrears I'm sorry if we did but sorry

753
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:19,910
I'm sorry we declined your talk politely

754
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:23,710
unless it was a sales talk and then we

755
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:26,240
rejected it with extreme prejudice so

756
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:29,510
which happens way more<font color="#E5E5E5"> often than you</font>

757
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,399
would think so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically we need people</font>

758
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:33,080
to help it's actually a much larger team

759
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,340
than you'd probably expect and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

760
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:38,750
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some recognition for them</font>

761
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:42,290
tomorrow but there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 people on that</font>

762
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:43,970
in that group and so not every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

763
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:46,130
person makes every single meeting and we

764
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:48,799
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that expectation but we need</font>

765
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:51,680
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> help we get anywhere between 40</font>

766
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:55,100
to 80 talks submitted for each one of

767
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:58,970
these meetings and so we need everyone's

768
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:00,529
help in vetting those and in shepherding

769
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,480
them through the process of getting them

770
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:04,760
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where they're ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

771
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,700
general audience to view and so if

772
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,070

to the mic you state your name and

804
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:56,430
affiliation and then we'll entertain the

805
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,430
questions

806
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:22,990
I'll kick us off my name is Dave Segal

807
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:25,790
I'm with level<font color="#E5E5E5"> three Thank You Patrick</font>

808
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:28,580
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the specific actions</font>

809
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:30,050
that nana is taken towards achieving

810
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,480
strategic goals I'm specifically

811
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:34,850
interested in the the goals around

812
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,960
attracting new members and bringing new

813
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:47,540
people under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization Betty do</font>

814
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:49,250
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to take that one specifically</font>

815
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:54,230
it's one of the areas that we need to

816
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:57,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">have more focused attention Dave I'm</font>

817
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:59,990
Manning a servicing a membership table

818
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,660
again in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our meetings it's one of the</font>

819
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:04,759
ways in which we need to reach out be

820
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,589
more visible and available to folks on

821
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,550
site at the meetings to answer questions

822
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:14,000
I think a big piece of what we're doing

823
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:16,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">to recruit new members is to confirm for</font>

824
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,010
folks why they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a member I</font>

825
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:21,110
have some folks who have talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font>

826
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:23,330
just today I'm a member but I'm not

827
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:25,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">really sure why I mean okay you need the</font>

828
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:31,340
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> right Betty you need the money</font>

829
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:35,750
clearly nanog could use an influx of

830
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:38,120
cash of all kinds but the reality is if

831
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:40,970
you become a member you become a stock

832
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:43,040
owner a stockholder an owner of<font color="#CCCCCC"> nana</font>

833
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:45,470
that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's important because</font>

834
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:49,790
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> membership you get the</font>

835
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:52,100
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to elect the board officers</font>

836
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:54,650
that will run nanog for the coming year

837
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:57,350
so that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the importance and it's</font>

838
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:59,920
getting my goal in keeping our strategic

839
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:02,779
alignment is to get that mission out

840
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,570
it's easy to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the executive</font>

841
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:07,730
director can send that message and send

842
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:09,950
more messages and deal with

843
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:14,780
communication and transparency issues

844
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:17,779
but I call upon the membership itself to

845
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:22,570
find someone who might volunteer to help

846
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:25,000
represent to the community the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value of</font>

847
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:28,510
membership so we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing things you</font>

848
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,270
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were ahead of where we were last</font>

849
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:34,300
year in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of membership we're doing</font>

850
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:37,000
more to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get messages out learning</font>

851
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:40,060
members to expiration dates of their

852
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,030
membership and encouraging new members

853
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:44,440
on site to sign up so we're growing

854
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:46,720
members but we're also losing some

855
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,330
members just because we're not dealing

856
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,200
technically<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well as we might things</font>

857
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:55,180
that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fix but the other piece</font>

858
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we really have to address in our</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">strategic plan and in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming year is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this messaging who needs to help with</font>

862
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:11,410
community as a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-winded answer</font>

863
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:13,270
hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> I answered just one other note for</font>

864
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:16,450
folks aren't aware as of today<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

865
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:19,800
333 members which when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all started</font>

866
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:19,799
planning this out a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago</font>

867
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:26,500
yeah we predicted like a hundred you

868
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:30,970
know or maybe 250 so you know we're

869
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:33,870
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing pretty good follow-up</font>

870
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:36,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">question so it sounds like you're really</font>

00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:39,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">targeting the night on community as the</font>

872
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">base for getting new members how about</font>

873
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:44,460
specific actions towards increasing the

874
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,460
size of the community as a whole

875
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:54,140
that's a loaded question so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

876
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,299
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this way by asking you a</font>

877
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:58,490
question we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about membership</font>

878
00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:00,770
which is a finite set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of group of</font>

879
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:02,689
individuals there there are not

880
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:05,359
corporate members their individual

881
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:08,960
members and that's by design and for a

882
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:19,970
reason community is different community

883
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:24,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">is everyone who participated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ly engage</font>

884
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:28,790
in conversation in our email list those

885
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:32,510
of members who attend our meetings which

886
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:34,550
regularly we see of the attendees

887
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:37,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">one-third of them are here for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

888
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:39,380
time so my job is to invite them

889
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:42,740
communicate with them that's the

890
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:44,420
community people who are in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> mail</font>

891
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:47,089
lists and people who come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

892
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:49,310
meetings that's a different set of

893
00:44:47,089 --> 00:44:51,190
groups some of those folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> will not</font>

894
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:55,279
become members for lots of reasons

895
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:57,770
they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as important and so we as a</font>

896
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,720
board continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be mindful and</font>

897
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:02,030
respectful that we want to grow the

898
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:03,950
community because that's good for the

899
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:06,530
internet the more people we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have coming</font>

900
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:08,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our meetings the more that we hope to</font>

901
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:11,390
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our educational programming</font>

902
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,510
the more we're facilitating education

903
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:16,490
dissemination about running operating

904
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:20,349
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet growing the internet that's</font>

905
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:27,609
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do membership slightly different</font>

906
00:45:20,349 --> 00:45:31,910
we need to grow that but it is sort of

907
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:33,460
it's important but some folks are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

908
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:36,500
never going to become members<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

909
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:39,290
they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> motivation to vote</font>

910
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:41,630
and to serve on committees all's they

911
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:43,700
care about is coming to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meetings and</font>

912
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:47,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">being part of the list and that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

913
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:51,529
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we love both I hope that</font>

914
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:56,349
answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to give you more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> contacts</font>

915
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:56,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">teeth we had the</font>

916
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:08,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay he's wearing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the invisibility cloak</font>

917
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:10,810
so the reason we<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduced the concept</font>

918
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:15,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a member is that previously foreign a</font>

919
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:18,250
dog to elect or to vote the rule<font color="#CCCCCC"> was you</font>

920
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:20,410
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have attended two meetings out of</font>

921
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:23,260
three in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> year and then you</font>

922
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:26,259
became eligible to vote and we thought

923
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:28,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was excluding all the folks</font>

924
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:31,840
that are contributing on the mailing

925
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:34,000
list who do provide a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of clue a lot</font>

926
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:37,480
of information on the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

927
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,940
it's as if we had two communities so by

928
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,520
introducing the membership we wanted to

929
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:49,660
include them and made them part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

930
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:51,940
decisions as well ok so I'm wonder if I

931
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:54,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">can tack a tech an answer on to that so</font>

932
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:56,830
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was hearing Dave's question a</font>

933
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:59,320
little differently and it sounded like

934
00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:01,150
that was not how do we get people from

935
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,740
the community into membership but more

936
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:04,540
how do we make the community something

937
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:12,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">more people will want to join is that</font>

938
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:13,779
where you were going with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so so</font>

939
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:16,450
I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a number of</font>

940
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:18,040
efforts you know along those lines

941
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:19,480
including the education thing that I

942
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,810
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> which dave is on the</font>

943
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:25,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">committee that's been working to define</font>

944
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:28,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea there is that</font>

945
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,770
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring you no more young network</font>

946
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,850
operators in Tanana I can have nano

947
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:32,500
could be the place where they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

948
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:35,380
learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the stuff but I think that's</font>

949
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,670
still a really important question to be

950
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,530
addressing here and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

951
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:41,230
have all the answers you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

952
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:42,730
often<font color="#CCCCCC"> we come to these meetings and we</font>

953
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:44,860
see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the same people over and</font>

954
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:48,430
over again and you know that continuity

955
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:50,530
is good but you know as I as I look

956
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:53,710
around this room and other rooms here

957
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:55,480
this you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this crowd that I</font>

958
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:57,160
joined 12 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and I look around</font>

959
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,200
here and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably at least</font>

960
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,700
a 10 year old you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the crowd on</font>

961
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,609
average is probably at least ten years

962
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:05,200
older than it was then so the you know

963
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:06,910
that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this question here if</font>

964
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,649
somebody is a new

965
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:11,348
you know new network operator getting

966
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:13,630
into the business you know what do we do

967
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:16,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make nanog a compelling thing for</font>

968
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:18,869
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to be a network</font>

969
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:21,039
engineer I have to be part of nanog and

970
00:48:18,869 --> 00:48:23,010
you know i think the education thing is

971
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:25,270
part of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think you know the</font>

972
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:28,210
tutorials we do or a big part of that as

973
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:30,180
well but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more to</font>

974
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:34,089
be done there you know perhaps you know

975
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:35,890
producing documents on you know how to

976
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:37,990
be you know how to do various network

977
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:40,690
operations tasks and things like that

978
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:42,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">and have nanog be the you know the</font>

979
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:44,260
resource that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to for that sort of</font>

980
00:48:42,339 --> 00:48:46,630
information but you know all these

981
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:48,130
things take a lot of work and you know

982
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:50,920
we're an organization that's largely

983
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:53,140
driven by volunteers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there if</font>

984
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,609
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> here really has ideas on you</font>

985
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:57,250
know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do you know to bring</font>

986
00:48:54,609 --> 00:48:58,660
in new network operators and need an

987
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:00,789
organization to channel that here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

988
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:04,529
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd be really happy to have some</font>

989
00:49:00,789 --> 00:49:07,960
people wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on that thank you</font>

990

992
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:16,450
track but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other part of the</font>

993
00:49:14,349 --> 00:49:19,720
question is how big do we want the

994
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:21,868
community to be it's an age-old question

995
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:25,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">i asked all the time having been</font>

996
00:49:21,869 --> 00:49:27,160
servicing nanog for quite some time we

997
00:49:25,569 --> 00:49:30,160
used to think that right size of nanog

998
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:34,089
was 250 people at a meeting will

999
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:37,509
probably be over 600 how big do we let

1000
00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:39,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meetings to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be how</font>

1001
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:41,529
big do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to grow and there's</font>

1002
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:43,629
another question I don't have the answer

1003
00:49:41,529 --> 00:49:46,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">to this but maybe the community does</font>

1004
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:49,510
there's some folks who see nanog as a

1005
00:49:46,869 --> 00:49:50,920
vehicle to do conferences and mailing

1006
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:53,079
lists and scholarships and a couple

1007
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,750
other things these other people who see

1008
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:58,240
nanog as you know the I Triple E for

1009
00:49:55,750 --> 00:50:00,910
network engineers and you know there's a

1010
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:04,240
vast<font color="#E5E5E5"> swath in between those two things</font>

1011
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:06,460
and the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know how far do</font>

1012
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,439
you want to go you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we're</font>

1013
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,150
producing good quality conferences and

1014
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,950
there's a mailing list with a decent

1015
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:14,200
signal to noise ratio and

1016
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:16,660
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steve has a great educational</font>

program for new network engineers you

1018
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:20,109

1019
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:21,400
the spectrum do you want to land and you

1020

know with knowing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> farther you</font>

1023
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:32,349
for it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to become sort of a</font>
