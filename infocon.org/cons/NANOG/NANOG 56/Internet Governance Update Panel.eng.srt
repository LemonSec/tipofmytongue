it's a safe bet that if your government

one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things I've been asked in all</font>

the time I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been speaking and doing</font>

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,680
this is how much what's going to happen

and I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know it's a guess and</font>

treaty itself is the articles there's 10

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:34,290
articles that cover 19 pages over the

55
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:39,030
work we've done for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last two years</font>

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:42,880
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the suggestions that different</font>

57
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:48,489
members have put in on modifications to

00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:51,250
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITRs it's grown</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to over 300 pages so</font>

it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the one thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

that long<font color="#CCCCCC"> when it comes out of Dubai</font>

there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just no way that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can get all</font>

63
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:07,750
the agreement so there's been lots of

64
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:11,590
press and lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rumors that the wicket</font>

65
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:15,519
is the opportunity for the ITU<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:20,579
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet that really isn't the</font>

67
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:22,870
case at all there hasn't been any

68
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,380
requests any modifications any

69
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:30,760
contributions that say let the ITU take

70
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:33,850
over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet however there are a</font>

71
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,280
lot of proposals that you really need to

72
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:40,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a look at and think about some of</font>

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:44,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">them address routing of spam network</font>

74
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:47,500
security but the panel is going to talk

75
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:50,710
about those various issues and how they

76
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,009
see them affecting them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

77
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,799
vent to make some opening remarks

78
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:58,969
wicked and then bill is going to talk

79
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,169
about kind of what's in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> future and</font>

80
00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:03,119
then I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to open it up to all of</font>

87
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:25,830
wondering why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm wearing a headset the</font>

88
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:28,080
folks doing AV here have kindly offered

89
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,969
me one which gets feeds from all the

90
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,219
microphones I can hear better some of

91
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:33,930
you may not know I've got a 65 DB loss

92
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:37,800
in both ears and while I have hearing

93
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:39,300
aids this is much better so I don't want

94
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,089
to be the guy that came to talk and

95
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,939
wouldn't listen first of all the last

96
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:48,740
time we looked at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITRs in a wicket</font>

97
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:51,330
meeting Wow was something like 1988 and

98
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,569
that was a time when most people didn't

you called is able to charge for the use

of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> telephone service and in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bill this settlement rates</font>

00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,610
were determined by the receiving parties

149
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,440
and in some of the especially the

150
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,830
developing world the prices were quite

152

things like that and the claim was made

153
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,909
that these high charges<font color="#E5E5E5"> were needed in</font>

country but the honest observation is a

157
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:45,310
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those places had telephone</font>

services run by the government<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> siphoned some of that money</font>

161
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,920
off so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the money went for the</font>

purposes for which it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> claimed it was</font>

regime in the internet space it

165
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,700
absolutely distorts and destroys the

166
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:07,810
basic internet model which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it each</font>

want to do to first order this has been

170
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,329
an incredibly powerful model because it

171
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,280
is allowed an enormous range of

originally have been intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it</font>

175
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:26,140
doesn't matter because it's an

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:28,390
end-to-end system the the notion of

177
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,699
introducing settlements can have massive

178
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,140
effects on the cost of operations for

179

to do a negotiation with every ISP in

the world before you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring up a new</font>

all well I won't go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and on on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this I</font>

186
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to emphasize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is</font>

187
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:54,550
real mischief and real harm that can

188
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,550
come out of modifications of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITRs in</font>

00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:01,150
ways that draw internet concepts into

190
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:05,319
its ambit with permission I'd like to

191
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:07,780
add<font color="#E5E5E5"> four other more general observations</font>

192
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,270
and then we should go on to others first

193
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:14,800
of all I think you should appreciate

194
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:17,890
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you do what you have allowed</font>

195
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,699
to to flourish has caught the attention

196
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:24,790
of governments sometimes it's not a good

197
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:27,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing governments believe that they</font>

198
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,910
should protect their citizens from harm

199
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:33,880
and if there is belief that there is

200
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,589
harm done the citizens by way of the

201
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,689
internet then governments are going to

202
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,090
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to intervene and I think everyone</font>

203
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:42,070
in this room has to admit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

204
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,230
some harms that occur on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net whether</font>

205
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,960
it's fraud or abuse or bullying or other

206
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,820
kinds of things and we can't we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

207

accept that that's the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to</font>

do something about it but it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font>

209
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,850
that clueless legislators are the right

210
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,920
way in which to solve those problems so

211
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,860
this is a real<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk and it's a</font>

consequence of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your success the second</font>

213
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,160
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the wicked is only one of many</font>

there's wit so which has to do with

00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:12,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">international standards there are</font>

217
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,710
there's the plenipotentiary meeting in

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:17,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">which the ITU revises its plans for the</font>

00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:20,560
for each<font color="#CCCCCC"> four-year period there are all</font>

us this is why<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's important to keep</font>

paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> attention the third point I want</font>

to make and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally is that there</font>

225
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,279
is this thing called the Internet

summit on the information society it is

229
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:42,660
a non decision-making activity it is

230
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:45,149
intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a multi-stakeholder event</font>

where people bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the table issues</font>

that are arising in the operation and

00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:55,470
use of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet I think we should</font>

preserve<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IGF and it's under some</font>

235
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,699
threat right now because its funding is

236
00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:03,149
not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear and it although it</font>

237

originally was created out of an ITU

00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:08,490
sponsored with us it's in a state now

239
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,748
where there's some risk the reason it's

240
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,050
so important is first<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

241
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:16,019
multi-stakeholder and second since it

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:18,899
doesn't make decisions it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:20,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the tables fairly extreme points</font>

244
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,170
of view but it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

245
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">those are and if this were a</font>

246
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,459
decision-making body where you had to

247

negotiate a text<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a communique you</font>

249
00:12:28,439 --> 00:12:32,519
that you get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the existing IGF so</font>

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I believe needs to</font>

252
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:41,059
remind you of a little dialogue that

took place in one of the star<font color="#CCCCCC"> wars</font>

this event has already alluded to the

267
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,500
fact that the the wicket which were

mostly concentrating on today is only

internet will be discussed so I just

273
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,130
kind of want to walk through what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

learned over the last few years about

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:18,780
this whole ball of<font color="#CCCCCC"> wax the outcomes of</font>

285
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,460
that was was not too bad a set of

286
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,620
principles for<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet governance were</font>

287
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,750
established at the head of state level

288
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,760
through the United Nations and really

289
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">what that boiled down to was that</font>

290
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:32,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet Governance was a</font>

291
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,610
multi-stakeholder endeavor and that all

292
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:36,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stakeholders needed to continue what</font>

293
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,990
they were doing in their respective

294
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:43,890
roles so in the case of Aaron for

295
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:46,589
example handling the the addresses and

296
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:48,480
numbering resources is being done well

297
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:49,890
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a government process Aaron</font>

298
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,290
should keep doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

299
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:56,189
are ours so that's kind of where this

300
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,910
all started and being a UN organization

301
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:58,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">having that</font>

important the United the<font color="#E5E5E5"> International</font>

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,910

implementing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wyss asst and that's</font>

307
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:13,079
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> things started to go slightly</font>

308
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,030
sideways because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they have</font>

309
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:20,340
turned out to be a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> disinterested</font>

310
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:23,790
party since the 2005<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wis asst they have</font>

311
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:26,250
had a series of events starting notably

312
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:30,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the standardization assembly for</font>

313
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:34,500
years ago in 2008 where they tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

314
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:39,390
set up an entity to really get very much

315
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:45,030
involved in how ipv6 was handled that

316
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:47,069
turned into a multi-year working effort

317
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:49,620
where where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet community had</font>

318
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:52,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">to really devote a tremendous amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

319
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,360
resources to to stopping that their

320
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:56,790
plenipotentiary conference which is

321
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,060
their main treaty event took place in

322
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,920
2010 again they looked at the at the

323
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,329
principles for<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet governance and</font>

324
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,569
for the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time they recognized the</font>

00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet organizations in what we</font>

326
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,820
thought was was positive text well

what's written<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what what gets used</font>

quite often differ there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

329
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,720
increased interaction with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

330
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:21,870
organizations but a lot of it has not

331
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,960
been very friendly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we see moving</font>

332
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:28,620
forward a series of conferences the next

333
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:32,880
major one is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wicked witch kathy</font>

335
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,140
interesting there has been a lot there

336
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:40,860
have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of efforts by some of</font>

337
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:43,530
the member states of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITU</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring up</font>

338
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,420
issues around that really involved the

339
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:47,490
internet things about spam and content

340
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:51,060
control and and again addressing a

341
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:52,860
numbering and the ITU staff have been

342
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,439
saying no no no this is not about that

343
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">this this is about telecommunication</font>

344
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,520
regulations and Vince gone through some

345
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,960
of the things you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be concerned</font>

346
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,480
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their and I'm sure we'll hear more</font>

347
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,490
about those what they do say though and

348
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> secretary-general</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ITU</font>

349
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">hamadoun touré has said it's not all</font>

350
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,889
about it's not about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

351
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,380
what will be about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is the</font>

352
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:16,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">world telecom policy forum in 2013</font>

353
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,490
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be all about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

354
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:22,119
governance<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the preparations for that</font>

355
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:26,109
have now begun and there are some fairly

356
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:28,208
intense negotiations going on around the

357
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:30,639
the text that will be discussed there

358
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:32,710
the good news about that is that unlike

359
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,200
these treaty conferences the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plant pot</font>

360
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:38,890
and the wicked this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a more open</font>

361
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,350
process and they are inviting people to

362
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:44,920
come in and and participate in the

363
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:48,070
drafting but we are certainly a kind of

364
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:51,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">second class voice there and it's going</font>

365
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:53,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be some tough tough slogging the</font>

366
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:54,760
reason we get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> participate in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

367
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:58,420
because it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a treaty conference</font>

368
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,860
and that in itself is is a mixed

369
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,960
blessing because a lot of governments

370
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't pay too much attention to</font>

371
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,870
conferences unless there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a treaty</font>

372
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,520
coming out the end I can say as someone

373
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:12,790
who's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> to these things for the</font>

374
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,070
Canadian government we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> not been as</font>

375
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:16,870
careful about the text<font color="#CCCCCC"> that comes out of</font>

376
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,610
there as as we should have been and

377
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,879
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned that we should have been</font>

378
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:23,379
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've suffered from not doing it</font>

379
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,910
US government the same some of the

380
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,500
European governments have really let

381
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,360
things slide because these aren't

382
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,640
binding they can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything with this</font>

383
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:35,530
well actually that's proved to not be

384
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:37,660
true the the 2008 Policy Forum produced

385
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:39,399
some text that was then introduced to

386
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,950
the next plan of at entry conference

387
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,250
which is a treaty conference and really

388
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:48,370
defines what what the mandate<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and</font>

389
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:51,460
activities of the ITU will be as though

390
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,929
it was given this is all the greed text

391
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,470
we just slide this straight into the

392
00:18:52,930 --> 00:19:01,060
treaty and that was a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> battle in in</font>

393
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:03,160
2010 to turn that back a little bit with

394
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:05,560
the 13 event being all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

395
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:10,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">Governance that's going to be much more</font>

396
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:15,000
intense this and as there is another

397
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:18,280
planet potentially conference in 24 14

398
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,950
again I expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the text discussed</font>

399
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,399
in the wicket brought up there the world

400
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,379
telecommunications policy forum text

401
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:27,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll certainly be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slid into the plena</font>

402
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:31,439
pot discussions there's another

403
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:34,200
development conference also in 2014 that

404
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,779
had the nature in 2010<font color="#CCCCCC"> of being a</font>

405
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,049
preparatory conference we're developing

406
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:43,529
countries were introduced to the the

407
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:45,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet Governance text and all with a</font>

408
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:48,629
view to having them take a stronger

409
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:51,440
position at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> plant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pot so there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

410
00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:54,928
this whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> series of events coming along</font>

411
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,739
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITU context that could ultimately</font>

412
00:19:54,929 --> 00:20:04,259
lead to a greater mandate for the ITU to

413
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:07,349
to have a role in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet as they</font>

414
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,479
define it and that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is what</font>

415
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:11,519
we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watch out for there</font>

416
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:13,999
are other things going on it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

417
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,899
the ITU that's that's active in this

418
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:19,469
events talked about the Internet

419
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:21,178
Governance forum 2015 will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font>

420
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:23,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">out from the world summit on the</font>

421
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:27,749
information society there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

up now to have those events re-examine

424
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:36,809
the text on internet governance so there

425
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:38,429
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on that if you</font>

426
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:40,469
were paranoid you might think it's it's

427
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:42,419

430
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:49,559
but the point I'd like to make here is

431
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,389
that it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important to watch</font>

there's a huge civil society presence

world looked like in terms of

475
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:56,639
international telecommunications it was

476
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,330
a world of largely government-owned

477
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,920
monopolies heavy state intervention in

478
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,560
the marketplace to the extent that the

480
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:12,929
extremely high<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs for telephone calls</font>

481
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:14,520
and essentially because of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the heavy</font>

482
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,890
government intervention in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the market</font>

483
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:20,360
there was a necessity<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a treaty in</font>

484
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:21,930
order to govern how international

<font color="#E5E5E5">telecommunication traffic would be</font>

486
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:26,640
exchanged across borders and that's what

487
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:30,360
this treaty does it's extremely high

488
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,760
level it's 15 pages and at its core its

489
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,560
goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to promote global</font>

490

interoperability and global

491
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:40,440
interconnection that's stated in the

492
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:43,470
treaty as has been noted it has not been

493
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,290
revisited since 1988 the world has

494
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:49,710
changed in terms of international<font color="#CCCCCC"> law</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

496
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,010
produce the

00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:57,750
the concepts of competition

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> granted in international</font>

communications have have really come

503
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:11,040
about as a legal matter since the 1988

504
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:12,870
treaty was negotiated so if one were to

505
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,670
take a look at the treaty itself you

506
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:18,060
would not find the word competition in

507
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:20,640
the treaty you would not find references

508
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:23,580
to liberalisation the concept of private

509
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,570
owned operators or service providers was

510
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:29,699
not contemplated in the treaty so for

511
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:32,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">over a decade governments have been sort</font>

of pushing around the edges of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font>

00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,810
saying look the communications landscape

514
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,550
has dramatically changed we need to do

515
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">something to make sure that this treaty</font>

516
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:43,770
reflects the changes in the

<font color="#E5E5E5">communications landscape of course the</font>

00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:52,230
major changed to international

telecommunications landscape since 1988

521
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:56,310
has been of course the growth of the

522
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:58,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet and the growth of ip-based</font>

525
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:06,300
which has of course taken place largely

526
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,470
outside of this treaty context so when

527
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,240
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> approach the International</font>

528
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:11,310

00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,650
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at where we've come from which</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">is a heavily regulated monopolized</font>

531
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,900
environment a whole series of changes

<font color="#E5E5E5">that have taken place since 1988 and a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that will in fact open that treaty up</font>

538
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:36,750
and say in light<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the changes since</font>

539
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:41,970
1988 this is what we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

540
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:45,270
included those changes as Vint and Kathy

541
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,830
had noted are looking at the fundamental

542
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:49,350
level to increase the scope of

543
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:51,480
application of that treaty so the scope

544
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:53,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the treaty currently limited to</font>

545
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,760
governments<font color="#E5E5E5"> and recognized operating</font>

546
00:25:53,580 --> 00:26:00,949
agencies there's a desire to open that

547
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:04,500
up to include we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know who</font>

these devices could arguably be

operating agencies so we don't know what

553
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:20,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that means that which creates of course</font>

a tremendous amount of legal uncertainty

580
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:29,310
out and others a very real desire<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

their arms<font color="#CCCCCC"> into treaty context</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

584
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:41,310
they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> control over and so I</font>

585
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:44,010
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> again when we leave wicket we will</font>

586
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:45,990
have a new treaty that treaty assuming

587
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:48,030
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they they reach consensus on a</font>

588
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,700
treaty<font color="#E5E5E5"> that treaty will be obligatory</font>

589
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:52,500
for the member states that sign it has

590
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,480
been said some of the government's may

591
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,340
say we take major reservations we're not

592
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,720
going to apply this in our markets the

593
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,030
other thing to understand is in many

594
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,250
developing countries they take the

595
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:06,690
treaty itself and incorporated whole

596
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:10,050
cloth international<font color="#E5E5E5"> law so if you do</font>

597
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:12,990
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> in countries that do that if</font>

598
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:17,480
you have interests in countries and

599
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:18,710
markets that aren't US or Canada

600
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,350
which I suspect most of you in this room

601
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:22,910
do this will affect the legal and

602
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:25,899
regulatory environment that you work in

603
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:28,070
so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to underscore take it seriously</font>

604
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,290
really look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of</font>

605
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:33,080
materials available to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

606
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:36,678
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and look at it but this isn't</font>

607
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:39,490
a declaration that sits<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a shelf this</font>

608
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:42,860
is a treaty<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gets implemented and is</font>

609
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:47,030
creates obligations that create rules

610
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:50,889
for all of us in this space so with that

611
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:53,840
I'll conclude<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks Thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> You Sally um</font>

612
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:56,590
so far we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> one view that's kind of</font>

615
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:09,049
real global view of things but I'd like

616
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:12,799
now to talk to Dan and then chip and get

617
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:16,629
an idea of what this how they see this

618
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:24,710

626
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:48,710
what's interesting about it is all of

627
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:50,690
that is a very iterative approach

628
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:52,429
because we just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it right the</font>

629
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:54,410
first try there's there's constant

revisiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> xand there's an evolution to</font>

it and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I bring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that up is</font>

632
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:02,240
because it's it's difficult enough for a

lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the businesses in this room to to</font>

environment when we're dealing with you

636
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:13,160
know financial budgets and projects but

637
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:17,090
to shift from this kind of

638
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:20,179
multi-stakeholder approach to to solving

639
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:24,350
problems to one of treaty defined

640
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:28,250
regulations adds a large layer of

641
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:29,610
complexity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this situation that would</font>

642
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,980
become an issue for

pretty much every business in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> room</font>

00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:38,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons why we've</font>

00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:45,900
these conversations and one thing that

00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:48,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">is always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of struck me in sitting</font>

648
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,970
in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these conversations is when</font>

649
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:53,190
when government a is talking to

government be and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're there very</font>

651
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:59,250
often it gets sidetracked with debating

652
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,880
the merits of one proposal over another

653
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:06,929
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're actually kind of joking before</font>

654
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:08,730
this panel where I I need a language

655
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:10,919
class to understand all the subtleties

656
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,210
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> communication between well my</font>

659
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,330
esteemed colleague and you know there's

660
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:24,320
there's such a<font color="#CCCCCC"> there such a different</font>

661
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:30,840
world there that often gets lost two

662
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:33,299
engineers this is actually where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

663
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,928
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the reasons to try and tie</font>

664
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:38,580
this all together is why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

665
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:42,270
communities like Nana<font color="#E5E5E5"> can play such an</font>

666
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:44,990
important part because when this

667
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:50,940
community provides technical data

668
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:54,540
presentations education analysis it goes

669
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:56,580
a long way to refocus the conversations

670
00:31:54,540 --> 00:32:02,490
that governments are having so that they

671
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:04,409
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> point to hard data or reasons why to</font>

672
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:06,080
make clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the implications of some</font>

of the policies that they're discussing

674
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,389
can have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know with without all the</font>

00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:14,490
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's provided by communities like</font>

676
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:17,940
this it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just gets kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of lost into a</font>

677
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:20,760
conversation of us versus them whereas

678
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:23,040
you have real-world implications of why

679
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,460
it would be a bad idea to create a

680
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:31,070
regulation such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> X it's a lot easier</font>

681
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:31,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a more constructive conversation</font>

682
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:37,700
so this is and that was one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> main</font>

continue to affect this converging world

686
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:57,919
of governments and engineers and how we

that we may be operate as well that we

years we've been looking at supporting

be growth to continue I think we've seen

great strides in the last five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years in</font>

many areas I think you all are aware of

the fiber that's been rolled into Africa

00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:37,668
gave about three or four years ago and i

exploded so much so things are changing

and we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> growth and</font>

that's fundamentally the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that</font>

all still awake and not not totally

742
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,540
bored with this but please if you've got

743
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:38,170
some questions some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">think you've heard should have it</font>

nothing else<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotten your blood pressure</font>

746
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:47,240
up a little bit to wonder I have a

747
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:49,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">question it's not a question that it's</font>

748
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,189
an observation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it occurred to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me as</font>

I listened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my colleagues one of the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">problems with introducing internet into</font>

752
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:03,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the potential to politicize the internet</font>

753
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,950
if the debates and discussions about

754
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:08,720
policy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet should not be mixed</font>

755
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,339
together with other disagreements that

756
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,520
countries might have with each other

757
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:17,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">because this leads to a tit-for-tat kind</font>

758
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,160
of behavior where a trade dispute leads

759
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,250
to an attempt to interfere with

760
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,799
internets operation as a way of trying

761
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pay back so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,790
dangers<font color="#E5E5E5"> of allowing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet to show up</font>

763
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:30,290
in the treaty world the second

764
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:32,750
observation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I make is that in in</font>

765
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:34,369
formality has been on a friend it

766
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:38,420
certainly has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> our friend in terms</font>

767
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:41,869
of connectivity and negotiating peering

768
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:45,080
arrangements of various kinds but I'd

769
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:47,240
also cite an example of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> conficker</font>

770
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:51,560
virus for example it would configure

771
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:53,569
worm instituted or cause to be created a

772
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,250
very informal working group that info

773
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,960
government agencies<font color="#CCCCCC"> involve law</font>

774
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:59,330
enforcement and involved the<font color="#CCCCCC"> technical</font>

775
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">community and so on completely informal</font>

776
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:02,720
and the reason that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked is</font>

777
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,610
precisely<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it didn't have a whole</font>

778
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,379
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of complicated rules and treaty</font>

779
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:08,870
arrangements and everything else those

780
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,880
two points I think should be kept in

781
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:13,370
mind as we worry about the side effects

782
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,960
of this introductory potential

783
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:18,080
introduction of internet into a treaty

784
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,830
like setting Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Ven okay I'm</font>

785
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:25,520
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start with center front please</font>

786
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:27,860
identify yourself and who if you're

787
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,980
directing a question to a panelist or

788
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:32,120
whoever so center front please hello my

789
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">name is Patrick Gilmore I work for</font>

790
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:37,670
akamai technologies first thing I'd like

791
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,540
to say is thank you all for working on

792
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,830
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> because this is desperately</font>

793
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:42,290
important I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure everybody</font>

794
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:44,240
in the room is awake because it's going

795
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:46,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">to affect every single one of you</font>

796
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,129
whether you like it or not so make sure

797
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:50,780
just a couple quick comments at least I

798
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,370
hope they'll be quick Kathy I'd like to

799
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:54,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">take issue with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> statement that you</font>

800
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:57,230
started off the panel with the ITU is

801
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:59,569
not trying to take out take over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

802
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet and the very next statement you</font>

803
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,720
said is it may address routing it may

804
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,370
address addressing it turns out at my

805
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,569
address spammy address security may

806
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:08,600
address qos it may address the

807
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:10,880
settlements may and somebody I forget

808
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,310
which gentleman was said that this is

809
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,940
not a creeping vision of the ITU because

810
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:18,320
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that organized the thing is</font>

811
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:23,090
stupidity is indistinguishable<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

812
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:25,400
malice and at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day if they</font>

813
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:28,760
do enough things they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken over</font>

814
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:32,780
the internet and this is provably

815
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:36,050
objectively harmful and it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

816
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,520
stopped the other thing that was set on

817
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,570
the panel sorry I have to actually look

818
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,710
at my notes make sure I get everything

819
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:45,980
right is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITU is specifically</font>

820
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:48,680
made to promote global interconnectivity

821
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:50,510
and communication the Internet has

822
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,390
promoted that far<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than anything</font>

823
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:55,750
the ITU is ever ever dreamt of putting

824
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,750
into place

825
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,910
and so for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITU to say well we need</font>

826
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:06,420
to do this to promote something when it

827
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:08,670
is objectively provably true that they

828
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,710
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually harm that is a bad thing</font>

829
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:12,630
and there are lots of people working on

830
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:15,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">this we just had a hearing track</font>

831
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:17,550
yesterday where Bill Woodcock presented

832
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:21,090
a paper he co-wrote for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> OECD proving</font>

833
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:24,060
that deregulation and open and lack of

00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:26,700
monopolies in a in a country lower

835
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:28,320
prices increased connectivity allow the

836
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,759
reach to extend and things like that and

837
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is being presented at the wicked I</font>

believe you know I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've gone to</font>

00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">things with barrack and OECD and stuff</font>

842
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,869
but not enough people in this room

843
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:44,520
realize that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this if you</font>

reading these papers if you don't send

emails that they will do it and you will

848

all be<font color="#E5E5E5"> hurt for it and it scares me</font>

do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of underwear</font>

851
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:10,660
okay okay thank Patrick you<font color="#CCCCCC"> passed</font>

852
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:12,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dan said earlier about needing</font>

853
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:15,430
language lessons to understand what's

854
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:17,640
being said I picked my words very

855
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:22,660
carefully there has not been one

856
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:26,319
contribution that says that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

857
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:28,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be under the ITU however that's</font>

858
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,480
what you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at because if it</font>

00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:34,299
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> that blatant it would be really</font>

860
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,190
simple it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little contribution that</font>

861
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:40,119
comes in from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this country or that</font>

862
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:42,010
country that<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggests that maybe they</font>

863
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:43,960
could do this or this should happen

864
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:47,500
that's what makes the difference and

865
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what makes it so difficult so it</font>

866
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,210
should have you at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying</font>

867
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:54,520
attention and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also why I picked</font>

868
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:57,790
my words carefully saying that you know

869
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,470
it won't the difference is

870
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,880
indistinguishable once they do these

871
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,740
little things so we are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> violent</font>

872
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,480
agreement I just hope everybody else

873
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,618
here didn't take the they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

874
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take over the internet and think oh</font>

875
00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:09,900
well then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's the main</font>

876
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:12,578
point be very careful you're going

877
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,760
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> close to turning into a policy</font>

878
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:14,760
wonk

879
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:28,330

880
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:31,090
I'm on the air and advisory council but

881
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:32,890
I'm just making an observation first of

882
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:37,720
all I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to thank you all for bringing</font>

883
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:41,379
this topic in such a transparent way to

884
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:43,839
everybody but but I i also like what Dan

885
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:45,940
said about the vernacular and how

886
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">different it is and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one</font>

887
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:50,410
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems of having this</font>

888
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:53,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">conversation in this room in other rooms</font>

889
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:57,670
is that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that vernacular</font>

890
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:59,710
and in fact as as much as I try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay</font>

891
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:02,130
attention to this and when I have

892
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:06,010
conversations with other people about

893
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:08,590
this threat or the actions that are

894
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:10,810
going on around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world I don't I</font>

895
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:13,960
don't do that very well because I don't

896
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:16,150
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the concepts well formed in my</font>

897
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,790
head I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the vernacular that</font>

898
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:21,940
makes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference and so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

899
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:24,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to marshal the</font>

900
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:26,470
efforts of people in this room and in

901
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:30,160
other people who don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it</font>

902
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:33,939
don't really understand it they need

903
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,279
tools that are would be effective in

904
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:38,500
helping them begin a conversation with

905
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,290
their lawyers or their senior executives

906
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:43,570
or their public outreach officials

907
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:46,660
inside their organizations they need the

908
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:49,300
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you guys could present or</font>

909
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:51,339
create that they could then take back to

910
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,650
those people that would explain this or

911
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:56,320
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them access to other people who</font>

912
00:42:53,650 --> 00:43:00,250
could talk at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> within the same</font>

913

context that they understand so if you

914
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:06,280
have tools like that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they would</font>

00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:07,959
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very useful if I if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not you're asking</font>

people to go have conversations that

917
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,840
there are incapable probably of having

it from the level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the abstract and</font>

better but but do take a look at some of

949
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:38,490
these proposals take one or two pull

comment on event because then I would we

1015
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,618
have 11 minutes left<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1018
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:53,310
observation that the that not only

1019
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:55,470
should the telephone industry have died

1020
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:59,369
some time ago with Aitu should have died

1021
00:47:55,470 --> 00:48:01,080
along with it I will say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tu d the</font>

1022
00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:03,600
development agency which is the largest

1024
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,950
radio spectrum has actually been helpful

1025
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:10,410
in my view and so I'm not suggesting the

1026
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:12,439
entire right to you should go<font color="#CCCCCC"> away but</font>

00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:29,550
characterizes precisely what what Jeff

is has said they are the painful dying

behind the scenes but as an end user it

1045
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,220
doesn't cost you more to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one site</font>

this is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it a routing truly</font>

horrifying has the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITU actually</font>

1051
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:21,720
discussed the impact on the fact that

1054
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:30,810
to cost significantly more versus

1055
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:33,119
someplace else for potentially different

1056
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:34,740
levels of content what is that going to

1057
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,010
do to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet experience and what</font>

1058
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,270
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do to</font>

1059
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:47,330
the things that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font>

1060
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:49,340
the internet right in short study<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

1061
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:54,440
and I cutie has been discussing in this

1062
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:57,320
sense about 1998-1999 has been

1063
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:59,750
discussing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue and it's going to</font>

1064
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:02,060
continue discussing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a next study period</font>

1065
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:03,470
for the next four years so I guess the

1066
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:06,710
answer to that part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question is</font>

1067
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:10,279
yes there are near is a group within itt

1068
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:12,619
that is discussing this issue but I

1069
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:15,140
guess I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to jump in on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1070
00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:17,359
the proposal specifically that's come

1071
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:20,359
forward from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> European telecom</font>

1072
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:22,640

1073
00:50:20,359 --> 00:50:25,759
construction<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things that have been</font>

1074
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,440
discussed in the ITU in the past and I

1075
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,210
think the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that question of</font>

1076
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:32,720
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would it mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for developing</font>

1077
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:35,869
countries I don't in our opinion not

1078
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:39,230
enough research and analysis has really

1079
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:41,119
been done we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some very good ideas</font>

1080
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:44,720
of what would happen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think it</font>

1081
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:47,089
would be in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad interests</font>

1082
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:49,129
of developing countries for these kinds

1083
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:50,900
of proposals to be instituted but you

1084
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:53,660
would have of course huge architectural

1085
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,910
issues as somebody said with routing to

1086
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:57,920
actually even implement this which is

1087
00:50:55,910 --> 00:51:00,109
kind of makes your head hurt if you if

1088
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,849
you go there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the regulatory</font>

1090
00:51:01,849 --> 00:51:06,050
and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get to the industrial and</font>

00:51:03,859 --> 00:51:07,549
the development implications you know

when you put a proposal like this on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

that we have been for so long we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

their real world can get pretty damn

1145
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:53,970
ugly pretty fast with some of these

1146
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:57,660
proposals the settlements proposal

1147

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is simpler and worse than what</font>

1148
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:02,259
it seems and that the proposal is that

<font color="#E5E5E5">the sender</font>

1150
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:08,740
but in reality the way that works for a

00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:12,250
small country or big country for that

1152
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:14,799
matter is that the ISP in the country

1153
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:17,380
can charge the ISP delivering the

1154

1156
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:24,760
that's the way it works in the telephone

<font color="#E5E5E5">world but what does that mean so a</font>

monetary analysis like when we saw this

1201
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,900
nobody's going to do anything with it

1202
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:34,509
anyway I might as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well just go and find</font>

00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:38,320
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to route around this damage please</font>

we're located today which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not the</font>

only government in the air and service

herzegovina this croatia in the way it

created non-governmental organizations

like this that non governmental

1242
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:25,090
structure that we sit in is an absolute

challenge to the brick country

00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:56,410
very very important this is activity but

00:58:54,280 --> 00:59:00,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">we have to mature our relationship for</font>

1256
00:58:56,410 --> 00:59:03,700
example to our<font color="#CCCCCC"> intelligence agencies are</font>

1257
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:06,940
law enforcement agencies<font color="#CCCCCC"> to aspects of</font>

00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:10,450
civil society such as those<font color="#CCCCCC"> who can be</font>

1259
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:13,630
impaired by counterfeiting so that we

1260
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:16,120
don't take a reflexive view and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1261
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:19,030
our non-governmental organization here

1262
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:20,529
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually matured very much in that</font>

1263
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:23,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">way in that we have law enforcement</font>

1264
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:25,000
people in the room today we have civil

1265
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:26,920
society in the room today<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>

00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually try and work out our policies</font>

1267
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:32,830
here what I want to say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess and is</font>

1268
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:37,000
that other governments just simply don't

1269
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:39,970
accept that conceptual framework and so

1270
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,060
the worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these is the the UN</font>

1271
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:46,359
structure the ITU structure because

1272
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:48,580
here's a bureaucracy that literally is

1273
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:51,340
threatened with extinction that the

1274
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:53,080
gravy train may end because the

1275
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:56,520
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> has changed and they're not</font>

1276
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:58,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> permit that so as we go forward</font>

1277
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:01,750
people want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to refer to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Michelle's</font>

1278
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:04,120
theory that<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations begin with a</font>

1279
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:07,000
purpose like the ITU of giving

1280
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:09,370
geosynchronous orbits or of doing the

1281
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,680
tariffs between countries but it's not a

1282
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:13,779
bureaucracy that will go away unless you

01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:17,650
suggesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have any interest in</font>

doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be it would be that</font>

1286
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:24,220
would be wrong and the metaphor would

1287
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:27,310
not be proper but in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> case the the</font>

01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:29,350
notion by the way that that we in the

responsibility is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to educate all</font>

1292
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:37,980
governments that have our Western view

01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:40,830
particularly

1294
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:43,020
of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited governmental role that they</font>

1295
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:46,200
actually recognize the stakes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1296
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:49,259
dealing with thank you Steve before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1297
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:51,180
turn it to the panel I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to say</font>

1298
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:53,760
you have to remember there's three kinds

1299
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:56,310
of governments Clint Eastwood identified

1300

the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bad the ugly we've got the</font>

1302
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:06,930
laugh at that but it is a serious issue

1303
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:11,690
when you have people making judgments on

1304
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:11,690
things they know nothing about<font color="#CCCCCC"> damn I</font>

they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is the effort</font>

1313
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:38,220
worth my time or what are we really

organizations and governments out there

01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:49,680
with sincere questions and like you're

1318
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:51,359
saying maybe not necessarily clueless

1319
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:53,368
but they don't know where to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look or</font>

01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:55,680
where to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the answers or how to go</font>

about solving those problems so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

one a worthwhile conversation along

1323
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:06,240
these lines is how to better place the

1324
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:08,130
question with the answer and how to

1325
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:10,350
facilitate these two worlds kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1326
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:12,030
communicating together whether that

would be where<font color="#CCCCCC"> there I sock would be a</font>

1328
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:15,600
good home for that or whether somewhere

1329
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:20,000
else would that's I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's a</font>

thank you I think Dan touched on one of

1332
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:28,810
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to follow up on one</font>

1334
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:34,509
couple of years attending these meetings

1335
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:37,230
and talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people is that you know</font>

1336
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:39,460
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> real people with real problems</font>

1337
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:41,560
that they have to solve I mean they're

1338
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:44,020
faced with real problems that they're

1341
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:50,950
the luxury of having separate bureaus to

1342
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:53,560
handle each type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of communication they</font>

1343
01:02:50,950 --> 01:02:56,230
may sometimes have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font>

01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:58,720

1345
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:59,920
we can help them you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the better you</font>

01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,049
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes even if we don't agree</font>

1347
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,000
with their position you know that they

1348
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:05,290
are they are still struggling with some

1349
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,690
of these serious problems that they're

1350

dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in their countries so I</font>

1351
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:11,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one thing we can look at</font>

1352
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:14,950
and following up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan is one important</font>

1353
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:18,180
item is in terms of helping is outreach

1354
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:20,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">is if you if you can meet you know the</font>

1355
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:22,359
regulators or ministry officials from

1356
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:24,610
other developing countries of the world

1357
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:27,010
you know to work with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and help them</font>

01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:28,300
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> how the internet works help</font>

1359
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:31,270
answer their questions because they

1360
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:33,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have the luxury of having you know</font>

1361
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:35,080
an industry experts coming in and

1362
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:37,209
providing them<font color="#CCCCCC"> information or helping</font>

1363
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:39,670
the system on technical questions so

1364
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:42,160
that's one real I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think real way that</font>

1365
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:43,990
you know we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help is is that outreach</font>

1366
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,330
does the education I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sock has</font>

1367
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:49,720
instituted a great program i think

1368
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:52,569
recently of inviting people to ITF

1369
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:54,970
meetings and if you run into any of them

1370
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:56,860
at IDF you know help you know introduce

1371
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:58,209
yourself to help them and ask them what

1372
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:01,980
they you know what their concerns are

1373
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:04,950
and help them understand the effect of

1374
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:07,090
on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> business and effect on their</font>

1375
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:09,069
networks and what's going in their

1376
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:10,600
country so that that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my main I</font>

1377
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:13,060
guess addressing some of the comments

1378
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:16,360
that came out earlier is is that you

1379
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:19,270
know if we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> help them then let's do</font>

1380
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:22,780
what we can to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> them out there so</font>

1381
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:24,520
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm gonna come on Sally than</font>

1382
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:27,040
vent then bill and keep it really short

1383
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:30,080
because they've been nice enough to give

1384
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">us two minutes and 39 more seconds so</font>

1385
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:35,549
we quickly thank you just to speak very

1386
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:37,980
quickly i'm in response i think to that

1387
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:40,230
to that question of whether all that

1388
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:43,440
work would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an impact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i do think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1389
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:45,150
answer is yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that the internet</font>

1390
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:47,730
community is having<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of an impact</font>

1391
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:50,190
than probably ever before on these

1392
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:53,100
discussions countries are asking the

1393
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:55,500
questions they are coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each of us</font>

1394
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:58,230
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> table with genuine questions and</font>

1395
01:04:55,500 --> 01:05:01,440
an interest in the answers so if ever

1396
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:04,350
there were a time to do that analysis

1397
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,240
and to provide your perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1398
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:08,250
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so if I could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leave you with</font>

1399
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:10,620
anything i would i would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't be</font>

1400
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:14,370
discouraged and weigh in it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1401
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:16,410
important to do that now I hate to

1402
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:18,960
finish this up with an observation but

1403
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:20,730
let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain to you that this is much</font>

1404
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:23,400
more tricky and dangerous than<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font>

1405
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:25,170
possibly imagine let's suppose that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1406
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:29,310
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain to every single</font>

1407
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:32,490
legislature and every operator that is

1408
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:34,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">making policy decisions exactly what the</font>

1409
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:37,109
impact of some of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

1410
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:39,990
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet now we all think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1411
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:41,700
it's bad for the internet it's bad there

1412
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:44,490
are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who would like the</font>

1413
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:46,620
internet not to work and so when we

1414
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:48,600
explained very carefully to them why

1415
01:05:46,620 --> 01:05:50,640
these following policies are bad because

1416
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,380
they disrupt the utility the internet

1417
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,540
they will say man this is a really good

1418
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea because we don't want the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

1419
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:59,340
around so<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't forget</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font>

1420
01:05:57,030 --> 01:06:01,890
multiple incentives hiding behind this

1421
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:04,380
facade of debate and that some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1425
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:16,590
been really important is is recognizing

1426
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:19,109
the opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of all this you</font>

rise to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge and that's been a</font>

1430
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:29,549
hard lesson to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there actually</font>

1431
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:31,740
is a reason why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have to pay</font>

1432
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:34,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">for that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risk mitigation if I can call</font>

1433
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:37,560
it that because the this won't go away

1434
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:38,500
on the positive side<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really think the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet community</font>

1436
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:43,390
is figuring out better how to engage

1437
01:06:41,110 --> 01:06:45,700
with governments in very positive ways

1438
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:49,029
bringing them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the IETF bringing them</font>

to meetings like this engaging at the

1440

Internet Governance forum and that's

1441
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:56,500
creating a more openness among

1442
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,450
governments that are not actually

1443
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:00,640
hardcore trying to kill the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet and</font>

1444
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:04,299
