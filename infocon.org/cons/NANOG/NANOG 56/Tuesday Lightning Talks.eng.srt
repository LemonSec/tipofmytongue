called site protect based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our prior</font>

topics with extensively to analyze

different aspects<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the DNS traffic but</font>

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,820
with this HTTP traffic we decided and

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,559
realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we needed something a</font>

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,420
little different but we want the same

18
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,280
sort of interface we want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,809
post and get content we want to look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,960
the source and destination IP addresses

21
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the various HTTP headers we wanted</font>

22
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">something easier than having TCP dump</font>

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,310
feed into a series of oxer grep sources

24
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,810
or Perl scripts and you know every

25
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,939
engineer doing their own thing and

26
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,890
getting different results so they asked

27
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:25,048
me to<font color="#CCCCCC"> write a tool and that tool became</font>

28
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:28,320
webtop again webtop is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS top like</font>

29
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,200
it was the inspiration it can analyze

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,199
and aggregate the data coming in off an

31

35
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:53,490
that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ddos attacks seem to have</font>

36
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,079
certain aspects that make those jump out

37
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,500
at certain engineers and thankfully we

38
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,570
can highlight<font color="#E5E5E5"> those also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any referrers</font>

for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic expected language packs</font>

41
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,389
as well so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another Avenue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

42
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,870
we're seeing a customer in Saudi Arabia

00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:13,160
getting a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic from Canada</font>

44
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:15,320
generally not something they expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

45
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">see so if that jumps out we know there's</font>

46
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:22,220
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> avenue we can address the traffic</font>

47
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:26,240
also for those of us see a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> crowd</font>

48
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:31,280
here a SPF and then geoip both of which

00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:33,459
are based<font color="#E5E5E5"> off of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open source CSDs that</font>

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,510
could be upgraded to anything ATM more

51
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:41,330
precise information back ends in

52
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,609
addition most of the header requests we

53
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,970
also break down within either source IP

54
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:50,450
or destination<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP in case there's one</font>

55
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,890
particular a handful of destinations or

56
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,660
sources that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a certain type</font>

57
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:58,518
of traffic we can isolate to that point

58
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:00,620
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> addition just measuring bits</font>

59
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:05,540
per second or packets per second is

60
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:08,360
something that we can also do in

61
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,590
addition but sometimes you don't want to

62
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,530
see everything that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming over the</font>

63
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,959
pipe so I wrote in the ability much like

64
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,570
DNS top to put in a Berkeley packet

65
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,190
filter so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can exclude</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or just</font>

66
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:21,980
focus on a certain type of traffic from

67
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,590
a certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> network but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

68
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:29,209
dealing with HTTP traffic also include

69
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:32,180
an HTTP filter so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can just look</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">at certain types of filters certain type</font>

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,470
of HTTP traffic headed<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8th any</font>

72
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,329
transactions that have this particular

73
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:42,890
pattern would show up in the display and

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:45,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing else now it's not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like DNS</font>

also util usable as a post action event

77
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,160
a tool to you can feed it in multiple

based on that content you asked for any

00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:09,710
also utilize here we have a top talkers

list

84
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:16,550
and here actually something referenced

85
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:21,050
earlier in an odd traffic from just

86
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:22,850
iphone and ipad devices so in the event

87
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:26,180
something odd was happening in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

88

particular area of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet we'd be</font>

89
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:32,150
able to focus on that from my

90
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">perspective and hopefully from yours it</font>

91
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:36,739
is one hundred percent Perl code it

92
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,650
aside from the lippy cap that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,170
utilizes through perl modules<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

94
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,690
extendable so if you know of a

00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:46,940
particular regex for HTTP header that

96
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:50,000

no matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> how many times I say that it</font>

were working on with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeff Houston</font>

114
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,550
essentially similar to the platform that

115
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:02,409
he described yesterday it's a web-based

116
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:05,140
experiment that pushes out ads that run

117
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,090
flash code and then you can run a

118
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,919
variety of tests with that flash code in

119

this case the tests<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were being run</font>

120
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:16,030
were ipv6 probing tests i'll describe

very at a high level what what overall

122

statistics we got and then talk about

123
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:24,010
deep dive into what is the population

IP addresses do we see when we're just

131
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:46,479
observing them in the wild so here's the

132
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:48,370
overall volume of unique IP addresses we

133
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,680
saw the experiment was run for six

134
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,150
months duration right in the middle

135
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,240
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you see a little bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ramp</font>

136
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,909
up is ipv6 launch day and you see

137
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,470
clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge buildup in the terms of</font>

the number of unique IP addresses we

<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv6 launch day right after that you see</font>

141
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:10,530
a huge drop-off in the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of unique</font>

00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,870
overall after ipv6 launch day it's

144
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,930
actually much lower volume than it was

145
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:24,070

or 7,000 IP addresses actually had this

tag embedded in them and when we so be

264
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:19,699
so we decode this and we end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">huge list of mac addresses then we go</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">back and take this list and correlate it</font>

268
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:31,630
behold the vast majority of these turned

270
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:37,430
in this experiment we studied what IP

addresses do you observe in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wild and</font>

272
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,670
then we go ahead and decode what

273
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,739
information we can just from the

274
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,449
structure of the ipv6 address we

275

transition technologies are working<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

any questions forgive me if I miss it

293
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:38,060
but ready you get all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> arrows is from</font>

294
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,800
these addresses were collected at a web

295
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,109
server so remember the experiment is

296
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,719
essentially pushing out ads which then

297
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:45,980
tried to probe back to a web server so

298
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,190
we collect these addresses of the web

299
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:54,260

actually the case Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bush RJ my name</font>

00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:08,030
as on firewire interfaces or certain

00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,520

324

ffe in the middle thanks that's a good

325
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:18,230
point yeah necessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> kya from Huawei I</font>

326
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,270
just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask I would like you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

327
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,950
clarify what do you mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by that point</font>

328
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:25,280
not seeing very many host identifier

329
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:28,310
with mac addresses where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see the</font>

330
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">hosts identified so basically this is</font>

331
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,060
the same point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was pointing out</font>

332
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,080
we see very small fraction of addresses

333
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,609
that have

334
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,210
mac address is embedded in the host

335
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:44,130
portion of the ipv6 address oh you mean

336
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:46,080
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rcd are to decide the IID yes okay</font>

337
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,610
thank you we're gonna have to cut it<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

338
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,370
just the three folks standing right now

339
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:53,160
yes I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the back was here first</font>

340
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,820
yeah thanks Lee Howard Time Warner Cable

341
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,650
I'm surprised maybe I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

342
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:01,530
the number that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you show for native ipv4</font>

343
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,660
clients or maybe was total ipv4 hosts in

344
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:07,020
the Aaron region was something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

345
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:09,180
forty one thousand I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I I have</font>

346
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,430
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than 41,000 I give you six users on</font>

347
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:14,820
my network and that doesn't include 18t

348
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:18,630
and Comcast and Verizon Wireless so what

349
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:20,220
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we missing can I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it's quite</font>

350
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,380
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the experiment didn't</font>

351
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,060
reach them I remember this the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

352
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,430
the experiment is distributed is over an

353
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,500
ad platform they have to be visiting

354
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:30,870
some website where this ad gets pushed

355
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,790
to them which then can run a probe so

356
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,679
this represents really a sample it's not

357
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:38,930
a census it's not going to give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

358
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,930
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> data set but it's a sample thanks</font>

359
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,649
Jeff Houston a panic I can actually

360
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:46,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain that Lee a little bit more we're</font>

361
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:48,420
cheap bastards so we actually did<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

362
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:50,610
clicks as low as we possibly could in

363
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,010
Google's<font color="#CCCCCC"> out engine so our ad gets</font>

364
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:55,560
displayed heaps in Indonesia and Poland

365
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">other places but over here where Google</font>

366
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,580
thinks you're all rich whether you are

367
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">or not sorella vynn our ad doesn't get</font>

368
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:03,480
displayed as much so yes it's certain

369
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,980
amount of does demographics of the ad

370
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,660
machinery the other thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

371
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,220
also be interested in at<font color="#E5E5E5"> some point is</font>

372
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,810
the failure rate of what actually goes

373
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,510
on because we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually see</font>

374
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:14,129
connection five years v4 is actually

375
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,200
working pretty well across most of the

376
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,480
net and you know the failure rate is

377
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:22,200
well below one percent of folk who try

378
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,810
to connect connect but in v6 even in

379
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,260
unique cars native mode the<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure rate</font>

380
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:30,899
is in excess of three percent so however

381
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:33,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going with v6 we're still</font>

382
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,300
encountering a huge amount of problems

383
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,970
inside the network I can see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sins</font>

384
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,610
coming in but when I respond with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> syn</font>

385
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:44,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">ACK it does add elicit any further it</font>

386
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:47,309
just stalls so even though you're seeing

387
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,990
a certain amount of up taking v6

388
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:51,600
quality in the v6 network is still

389
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,909
leaving a bit to be desired just one

390
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,980
last point so there's a lot more digging

391
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:57,360
right behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question and you know</font>

392
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,759
it's basically the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> point in the</font>

393
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">conclusion slide and I think there's</font>

394
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:07,259
going to be you know follow on

395
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:09,960
presentations on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you Michael</font>

396
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:11,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sinatra ESN um one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the FFF</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> e</font>

397
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,029
again is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are platforms out</font>

398
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:17,908
there that compress ACLs because they

399
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:21,929
only have 128 bit wide a CLT cam space

400
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:25,320
so you have to compress the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FF fe out of</font>

401
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:27,749
an eui-64 dress and use that 16 bits for

402
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,330
the port number and as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

403
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:32,940
are people who address statically

404
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:35,189
servers that look like they have you I

405
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,840
64 dresses to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the router think it</font>

406
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:38,700
can compress that address and use the

407
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,559
bits for the port so they can have more

408
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,999
rich<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACLs so they're going to be some</font>

409
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,168
weird skewing things i'm just going to

410
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:44,820
screw your results too much but they're

411
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:47,519
all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird things going on in</font>

412
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:53,369
eui-64 land so your mileage may vary

413
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:55,529
yeah thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks peniche can I have</font>

sdn get ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write this down</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">abyss lightning talk so so what is sdn</font>

421
00:20:22,499 --> 00:20:28,029
what's up were defined networking any

422
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:29,649
questions um<font color="#CCCCCC"> well actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the</font>

423
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:32,019
best way to define a new buzzword is

424
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:37,689
with an older<font color="#E5E5E5"> buzzword so it's cloud</font>

one what's cutting of cause the most

00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:47,100
recent hype is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it open flow which is</font>

430
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:50,350
basically in interface between

431
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:52,168
controllers and switches right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

432
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:55,570
a way to program switches<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's entering</font>

433
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:57,990
fib<font color="#CCCCCC"> entries into into a switch from a</font>

434
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:02,980
controller that can it be centralized

435
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:05,320
put into a cloud or what have you um and

436
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,450
the purpose is there or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

437
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">fold right so the one that gets touted</font>

438
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,840
most often or at least first seems to be

439
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,700
this idea of commodity switching

440
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,769
hardware the problem with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument</font>

441
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,840
is that you still need really high power

442
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:18,909
or really you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-performance</font>

443
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,379
switching hardware you just don't have

444
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:21,999
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it with the software necessarily</font>

445
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,678
and you still need really great

446
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:24,940
switching software you just don't have

447
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it with the hardware necessarily</font>

448
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,450
so I don't know that your capex if

449
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,740
you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see capex you</font>

450
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,889
know changes with with an open flow

451
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:33,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">network necessarily one of the cooler</font>

452
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:35,320
pieces though is interfacing directly

453
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:36,998
with applications right so now the

454
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,830
network can be talked to potentially

455
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:40,869
these applications can interface with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

456
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,678
controller which can interface with with

457
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:46,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network and you can have perhaps</font>

458
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network paths built and torn down by</font>

459
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:49,269
applications as needed provisioning

460
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:51,009
systems might become much simpler

461
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:52,740
network troubleshooting perhaps becomes

462
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:55,960
much simpler if you're tied directly in

463
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,549
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next point is even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cooler I</font>

464
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,830
think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that maybe you get to be able</font>

465
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:01,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">to not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your vendor of</font>

choice your hardware vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> of choice to</font>

467
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:05,619
add a feature for you instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting</font>

00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,200
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list you get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just write it</font>

469
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:10,509
yourself or or have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party app</font>

470
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,379
developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> write it potentially and then</font>

471
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:13,240
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a global view of the entire</font>

472
00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:14,559
network because this you know controller

473
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,730
now sits off of the switch instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

474
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,080
having this distributed control plane

475
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,419
that's that's a little bit in every

476
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,189
single switch or router you have one big

477
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:22,629
one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see everything which leads</font>

478
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">to efficiencies that's what we've seen</font>

479
00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:25,360
with you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big deployment at</font>

480
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,740
Google obviously the press releases I've

481
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,090
seen say that they're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

482
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,559
close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a hundred percent network</font>

483
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,029
utilization on these<font color="#E5E5E5"> links now because</font>

484
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:32,529
able to see the big picture and

485
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:37,299
interface with the applications directly

486
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:39,279
a newer idea besides open flow is is IRS

487
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:40,418
the interface to the routing system the

488
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,519
problem statement was just written right

489
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:43,779
at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> July so this is fairly</font>

490
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:45,970
fresh and then there's there's a

491
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:49,330
framework as well and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can think</font>

492
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this first step is it's you know open</font>

493
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,439
flow but with routers instead of

494
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:55,090
switches it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more different than</font>

495
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's instead of removing the</font>

496
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,240
control plane here's interfacing with

497
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:00,850
the control plane so you can still have

498
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,869
this off board controller potentially

499
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,090
but then it's interfacing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

500
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:05,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">existing routing protocols so you can</font>

501
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,658
inject things into existing routing

502
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:10,539
protocols and get information out which

503
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:12,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">things another big part of SDN right is</font>

504
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:14,320
getting more and better information out

505
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,240
how do you actually measure users

506
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,129
quality of experience in real time on a

507
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,759
service basis rather than just you know

508
00:23:18,129 --> 00:23:23,678
counting bits going across an interface

509
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,169
sdn p software-driven network protocol

510
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,240
is another example this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a framework</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that was built around a ba fat the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF</font>

defines it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful for looking at</font>

515
00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:39,008
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the evolution of SDN as we go</font>

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of three you know your applications</font>

and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where controllers or</font>

orchestrators and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> network devices</font>

521
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,990
and the communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> path between them</font>

522
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:55,149
right um I'd added this in here i have

523
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:57,309
actually no idea what it is what it's

524
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:58,840
being announced today in<font color="#CCCCCC"> darmstadt so i</font>

525
00:23:57,309 --> 00:24:02,289
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd throw</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in network</font>

526
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:04,658
functions virtualization there's a bunch

00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:08,169
of big telcos have gotten together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

528
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:10,210
they were announcing this today so we'll

529
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:12,460
see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes of that as kind of a look</font>

530
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,409
into carrier st and<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights moving out of</font>

531
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,639
the data center into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> carrier space</font>

00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:19,330
in the ice<font color="#CCCCCC"> p space which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is why i'm</font>

533
00:24:15,639 --> 00:24:22,539
interested in sdn is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of you</font>

534
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:24,789
know moving it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP networks as well</font>

535
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:27,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">instead of just data centers I know HS</font>

536
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:29,470
is also looking into defining risks and

537
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,769
rewards of s tienen and that kind of

538
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:34,779
thing this is one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did but many of</font>

539
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:35,860
you probably not heard of active virtual

540
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:41,770
network management protocol

541
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:43,899
scheme out of a PhD at GE and is<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

542
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:46,960
at some active networks are basically

543
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,250
there's executable code in the packets

544
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,080
coming across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network that are</font>

545
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,429
affecting changes along<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

546
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,830
your packets are actually instructing

547
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:55,390
the network as they travel along it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

548
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,290
then with this virtual network

549
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:59,290
management protocol you're actually

550
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:01,720
proactively based on potential future

551
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:03,399
events doing network management instead

552
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,330
of reacting to things you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

553
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,020
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen ahead of time</font>

554
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:11,620
and can manage them kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a time</font>

555
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:14,620
warp um and then there's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more</font>

556
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:17,020
right so SNMP really is is the first one

557
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">that came about which started right</font>

558
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,639
about the same time that IP started very

559
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,600
closely after it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed for humans</font>

560
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,370
to interact<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network not</font>

561
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,830
applications but it's a software

562
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:29,530
protocol that's used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage networks</font>

563
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:31,210
right so sdn I think net comp obviously

564
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,190
forces is another one that hasn't really

565
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">gone anywhere but does that control</font>

566
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:40,809
plane separation as well pce is an idea

567
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:42,340
to build mpls LSPs off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ls ours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

568
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:44,320
have another device a path computation

569
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:47,470
element if you add into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network that</font>

570
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,080
then can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build LSPs and send out labels</font>

00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:52,390
and things rather than the ingress<font color="#E5E5E5"> LS</font>

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">are doing it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CDN</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I is another one that's</font>

573
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:58,059
looking at sharing information between

574
00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:00,400
CDN providers and then obviously down to

575
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:02,379
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that pearl or shell script</font>

576
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,669
you've written to configure your network

577
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,120
or pull information out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

578
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:08,650
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's software defining the network</font>

579
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,360
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also I don't say like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the define</font>

580
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,590
term right because it's two ways we're

581
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,270
really talking about two ways we want to

582
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,230
put information<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the network we also</font>

583
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,580
want to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> information out of the</font>

584
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,650
network so i don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that STM's</font>

585
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,330
really the best term but we've been

586
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it for a long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

587
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,168
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can eat more easily tell you</font>

588
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:26,820
what Sdn is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> then what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is it's not</font>

589
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:29,260
open flow it's bigger than that it's

590
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:31,809
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just one protocol right and</font>

591
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:34,059
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really new so SNMP again has</font>

592
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:35,799
been around for about 24 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're</font>

593
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,260
doing this for a long time we're on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

594
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:39,250
you know kind of continuum of

595
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:42,490
abstracting net work things out with

596
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,660
with software so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if we look at</font>

597
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:46,780
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know yesterday's I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Stan or even</font>

598
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,080
today's sdn really we call it BSS OSS

599
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,840
instead right so you

600
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,750
you're ordering system toxic

601
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,029
provisioning system or a person gets up

602
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,529
and moves you know in order to a

603
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:58,760
provisioning system and then the

604
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:00,110
provisioning system then can either

605
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,629
provision services or tell someone

606
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,510
information services into the network

607
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,500
right so that's kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way it looks</font>

608
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:08,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">the open flow model is to kind of</font>

609
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,620
replace that do this network control

610
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:11,120
layer that's open flow all the

611
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,330
application sucked open flow flow talks

612
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,379
to all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> switches and that's it</font>

613
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:18,710
possibly great if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're building a</font>

614
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:21,860
green field data center maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

615
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,870
practical in other cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I see more</font>

616
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of an emerging ecosystem around sdn</font>

617
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,879
where there's a number of AP is needed

618
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:30,590
here right so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

619
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,049
applications at the top which then can

620
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,820
talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of global</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> orchestrator</font>

621
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:36,320
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> collects all the information within</font>

622
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,879
applications and is able to understand

623
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,500
what the applications are asking for and

624
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,149
then push that<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to something like an</font>

625
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,519
open flow controller or an IRS

626
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:45,379
controller or you know an nms<font color="#E5E5E5"> EMS</font>

627
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,360
whatever else you're running in that

628
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,580
kind of network control layer which just

629
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,928
isn't necessarily on the device and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

630
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:55,570
those of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> then talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to your actual</font>

631
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:58,220
switches and routers in the network so

632
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,689
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this the end I think it's the</font>

633
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">current name for a continuing trend</font>

634
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:05,179
towards greater network virtualization

635
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:06,500
through software abstraction it's not

636
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:07,909
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not new and it's not necessarily</font>

637
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,710
well defined yet but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

638
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:11,630
exciting as we extrapolate this out into

639
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:14,149
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future and you look at what it means</font>

640
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:17,210
for networks you know lowering op<font color="#CCCCCC"> x</font>

641
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:20,360
through greater efficiency and you know

00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:22,940
potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> really customizing networks</font>

is the third epoch of networking is some
