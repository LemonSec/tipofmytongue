1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,430
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just so just as the quick</font>

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,120
introduction into frame things I'm

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:11,940
palabras<font color="#E5E5E5"> man I work at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Infoblox in our</font>

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,290
ipv6 group and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I do is I</font>

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,790
go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk to people and sort of</font>

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,740
collect their experiences of what

7
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,359
they've had in a way of good and bad

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,038
things rolling things out I'm also one

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,600
of people that goes actually I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am the</font>

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,609
person that goes to the IETF for

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">infoblox to participate in see what's</font>

12
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,410
coming down the pike so basically what

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,060
i'm doing here is sort of sharing what

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,830
are the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably all</font>

15
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,019
gotten used to doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have stopped</font>

16
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,420
questioning<font color="#E5E5E5"> as assumptions because we've</font>

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,300
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it so long and before some of</font>

18
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">the new things in b6 and what that might</font>

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,879
do to change how we're sort of tearing

20
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,410
apart in building up our new networks so

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,489
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of material here I'm going</font>

22
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be going through some of it a little</font>

23
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,849
fast but it is on the slides my email<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

24
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,500
also on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides and I am also going</font>

25
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">through so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can have five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

26
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,620
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end for some question and</font>

27
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:05,188
answer so basically like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said that the</font>

28
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,580
assumption here is that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font>

29
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:11,070
to have you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 70s Leisure Suit</font>

30
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,270
mentality about your network we have

31
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,740
been doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing with me for</font>

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,479
four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font>

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,360
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses functionally for years</font>

34
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,970
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have done things with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT in 1918</font>

35
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,860
and clever pool sizes and all sorts of

36
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,929
other crap to try and keep things glued

37
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,909
together and we've gotten so used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

38
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,520
pain that we now design our networks

39
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,829
that way is if that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct and the</font>

40
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,170
reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is that no that is the best</font>

41
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:37,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">way to deal with what we have and a lot</font>

42
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,090
of that is different v6 so there are a

43
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,920
huge number of changes the IETF loves

44
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:45,960
changes because they don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,820
to make things operationally ready myth

46
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that change is good well not</font>

47
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,679
necessarily but we are all going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

48
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,270
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it v6 is pretty much</font>

49
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,979
inevitable at this point the only

50
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,420
question is when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

51
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,189
putting it into which places in your

52
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and how are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going to be</font>

53
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:03,389
migrating gradually to have your v4

54
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,490
probably move further and further to the

55
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,500
edges there are a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we</font>

56
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:10,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">have sort of gotten used to it this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

57
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,050
what we don't have particularly address

58
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,890
space and subnetting space that are no

59
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">longer issues</font>

60
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,549
and the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I tend to</font>

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,530
emphasize is this is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> as big a</font>

62
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,319
paradigm shift as when we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> went from</font>

63
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,000
class full addresses to cider in how we

64
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in our backbone</font>

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,220
and how we do our dress usage is at

66
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,090
least as educationally challenging or

67
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,640
disruptive to our lives if not more some

68
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,940
of the good news<font color="#CCCCCC"> um there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of</font>

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,059
things that we did learn about and there

70
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,070
are there in v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's going to allow</font>

71
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,350
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> six on routers to be much more</font>

72
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">efficient at the point at which we have</font>

73
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,959
v6 only backbones and you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

74
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,670
switch before packets it's a fixed

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,459
header size so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly how many</font>

76
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,869
bits to snap off the front instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

77
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">having variable length and all of the</font>

78
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,010
options built into this amorphous blob

79
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,140
there's now an extension header chain

80
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,390
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other efficiencies is that</font>

81
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,190
the router specific extensions are all

82
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,869
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front of the chain so any</font>

83
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,400
intermediate device<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the sender</font>

84
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,709
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the destination as soon as they hit</font>

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,370
a non relevance header they can stop

86
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:21,780
parsing flow labels are better placed in

87
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,060
the headers and potentially may be

88
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,170
useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that wonderful mythical</font>

89
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:31,530
unicorn we call quality of service

90
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:33,268
another good thing in some ways there is

91
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,940
no intermediate fragmentation anymore

92
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,709
there's path MTU discovery only the

93
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,430
sender is allowed to fragment packets

94
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,630
now so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have middle layer boxes</font>

95
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,850
screwing up<font color="#E5E5E5"> fragmentation and reassembly</font>

96
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,470
which has been one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

97
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,480
that those middle layer boxes do to make

98
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:50,519
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives more interesting another one</font>

99
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,018
was there are no check sums because

100
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">their check sums in the layer below and</font>

101
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,430
above it there is really no need so all

102
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,709
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things together mean that</font>

103
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,230
router code will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the point where</font>

104
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,860
if it's in a sick and it's v6 native

105
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">only will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shovel</font>

106
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,880
significantly more bits potentially and

107
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,430
have more control over<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like flow</font>

108
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,560
based routing there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> things on</font>

109
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,720
the local wire<font color="#CCCCCC"> too I will call it the</font>

110
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,880
broadcast domain that there is no actual

111
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,310
broadcast in vb6 but it's the same thing

112
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,260
one single virtual wire first of all

113
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is no broadcast it's all multicast</font>

114
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,480
which is one single sender to multiple

115
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:29,729
recipients who have subscribe

116
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,290
two messages of that type and they're

117
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-known type so if you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach</font>

118
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,680
all the routers on the subnet there's a

119
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,410
specific reserved address if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

120
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP servers or relays or a</font>

121
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:43,110
recursive DNS server or all the hosts

122
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,330
they're all there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can send in</font>

123
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,280
only those entities that care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

124
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,190
being that type of box will need to

125
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,950
listen and neighbor solicitation and

126
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,110
solicited node is these replacement for

127
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">our how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you take a mac address in turn</font>

128
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:01,440
into a v6 address on the local wire<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

129
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,659
hashed on the last 24 bits so again even

130
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,460
that which in theory is a broadcast only

131
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the people whose last 24 bits of their</font>

133
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,770
icmpv6 has become much more granular and

134
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,360
specific in all of its type so you can

135
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,219
be much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more particular about what you</font>

136
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,110
filter and do and don't allow all of

137
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">those together mean that there is less</font>

138
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,070
overhead on a local wire now this

139
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,410
doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we'll be able to go up</font>

140
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,900
from 256<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a thousand host to 18</font>

141
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,280
quintillion but it does mean that will

142
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,620

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:38,730
than we used to once we're v6 only and

145
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:40,890
not dual stack so one of the things I

146
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,420
love about v6 is we have been calling

147
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,780
ourselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> network architects for years</font>

148
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:48,030
but we're really more like plumbers and

possibly even<font color="#E5E5E5"> handyman we are taking</font>

152
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,719
these tix we actually have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> chance</font>

153
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:00,210
again to do what our job titles says

154
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,090
actually design the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font>

156
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,919
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we can actually subnet again</font>

157
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,990
and subnetting is not how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I fit as</font>

many hosts as possible into the address

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,730

any form of n toast whatsoever give it a

than two endpoints there are proponents

217
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,220
that say you should use a 64 for

everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> including point2 points</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">point but there are security reasons</font>

223
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,910
read that RFC that will explain it if

224
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,730
you want to truly have every subnet

225
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:50,829
everywhere is always 64 no matter what

226
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:52,600
the current compromises you allocate a

227
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,340
64 for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point-to-point link that you</font>

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">only configure a / 120</font>

229
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:00,010
that way you get the allocation ease of

230
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,910
a single subnet size but you have the

231

<font color="#E5E5E5">security problem dealt with any place</font>

you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the / 31 in your current</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

233
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,319

238
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,290
160 for that is all of your

239
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:25,240
point-to-point links 164 that is all of

240
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,189
your loop backs and that is per routing

241
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,840
area obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have discontinuous</font>

242
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,000
areas you will need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give 64 stewie</font>

243
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,220
inch one of the reasons that that's good

244
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,600
is you then have a 64 that is the

245

<font color="#CCCCCC">loopback</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for every router and every</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually make your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles make sense</font>

251
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:55,780
easily here's a sample plan basically

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:58,000
envy<font color="#E5E5E5"> 48 that boundaries are easy anytime</font>

253
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,709
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do a subnet that is or a prefix</font>

254

length that is it a multiple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight</font>

255
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:04,180
it's easy because you are not dividing

256
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,720
the number between the dots in the ipv4

257
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:10,390
address we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done that with cider but</font>

258
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:15,270
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as easy the equivalent is that</font>

259
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:17,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're 128 bits in a v6 address 32</font>

260
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:20,260
hexadecimal characters that's four bits

261
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,569
or a nibble for each one of those hex

262
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:25,120
characters so again to make your<font color="#CCCCCC"> life</font>

263
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:27,850
easy if all of your prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lancer are</font>

264
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,320
divisible evenly by four you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are never</font>

265
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,630
dividing in the middle of one of those

266
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,800
letters for right now that's a whole lot

267
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:36,250
more readable and there's enough space

268
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,790
to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and even the rirs and li RS</font>

269
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,920
are doing that allocation info box has

270
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:46,410
eight sites that have no backbone

271
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:49,240
between them we didn't need more than 48

272
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,610
in terms of subnetting for our entire

273
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,320
company but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had eight sites so when</font>

274
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:55,750
we went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron and said we have eight</font>

277
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,319
for each of them 16 of them would be

278
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">plenty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for you therefore we will give</font>

you a 44 and that was our whole

280
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,420
justification wasn't how many hosts it

281
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,290
wasn't anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was we have</font>

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:15,189
we need a 44 done in this case this is

284
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:17,019
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I'm a data center and I am in</font>

285
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,490
multiple cities and within the city I

286
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:20,410
may have multiple buildings that I have

287
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,850
equipment and what I usually do is I

288
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,380
break it down all the way down to VLAN

289
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,959
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually have a customer for VLAN</font>

290
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:28,360
in this case I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through how many</font>

291
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,729
of each do I need well in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my example I</font>

292
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,850
assume I have 12 cities so 16 possible

293
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:36,399
is enough so<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 bits is enough if I had</font>

294
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,259
needed 24 cities I would have had to

295
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,120
jump up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next chunk which would</font>

296
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:43,750
have been eight bits and it would have

297
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,720
been 256 yes I'm wasting space but it

298
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,639
made my scheme work and we have enough

299
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,829
space to do that so what this means is

300
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,199
by the time I get to a 64 for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a VLAN I</font>

301
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:55,089
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the customer I know</font>

302
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:57,008
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly which city i'm in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know which</font>

303
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:59,290
switch I'm in I'm know which VLAN it's

304
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:01,089
all completely self documenting I don't

305
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">even need to do reverse pointers to know</font>

306
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:06,610
exactly where that customer is and it's

307
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,949
all about subnets we are no longer

308
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:11,230
counting hosts like we do in v4 it is

309
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:16,359
not I have 256 hosts therefore I need us

310
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:19,810
a / 22 or<font color="#CCCCCC"> flash 19 whatever it is how</font>

311
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:24,660
many subnets and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you get your</font>

312
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:26,739
allocation if I getting / 36 from right

313
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,990
what they're actually going to do is

314
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,910
they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a 32 they're going</font>

315
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give me the first half of that 32 and</font>

316
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:35,339
they're going to block the other half

317
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:38,439
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> reserve it in case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I need it later</font>

318
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,660
that way if it turns out my allocation

319
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,040
scheme didn't work I go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them and</font>

320
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,170
they say okay here just change your

321
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,599
prefix length use the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> half you</font>

322
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to remember it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just works so</font>

323
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:53,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">again get everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need get it now</font>

324
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,519
get it while the rars are being generous

325
00:12:55,319 --> 00:13:02,439
and yeah there are some limitations

326
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">there 18 quintillion possible addresses</font>

327
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:07,540
in 64 but again I've talked about this

328
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:09,699
layer to stuff Trump's you will still

329
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:14,290
get a couple thousand entities on an end

330
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:16,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">its of ice and last point at some point</font>

331
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,240
we may not be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do nibbles we may</font>

332
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:21,910
be doing cider on v6 I predict we will

333
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,350
because we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> history of way</font>

334
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,110
seeing any amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of anything we've ever</font>

335
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,910
been given but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least while we can</font>

336
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:32,170
make it sane for ourselves let's enjoy

337
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:34,000
it and use the whole 64 particular to

338
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,650
things like pool sizes you know one of

339
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,660
the things that has always been touted

340
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:40,439
as v6 is more secure as they can't do

341
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:43,390
brute force scans well that's true but

342
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">if what I do is I say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm on dot</font>

343
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:50,260
one dot whatever you know when I you 168

344
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:53,080
1 for a subnet and my host has got 100 I

345
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:57,069
can certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> say 2000 cold and DBA</font>

346
00:13:53,080 --> 00:14:01,120
colon<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 is my prefix I can go colon</font>

347
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:03,070
colon 100 and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same host very</font>

348
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,440
easy very self documenting and for my

349
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,660
service machines I do that but I've also

350
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,400
now just reduced<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scannable space</font>

351
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,219
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to worry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about from 18</font>

352
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:15,160
quintillion to 256 which is brute force

353
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:21,310
cannibal so if you want that protection

354
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:23,680
use the whole pool you may have figured

355
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:27,219
out that I have certain opinions about

356
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,930
19 18 in that they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably one of</font>

357
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,150
the worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ever did to each to</font>

358
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,800
ourselves fact when we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> running out</font>

359
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:36,160
of address space in the 90s<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 80s</font>

360
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,510
that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to ipv6 all everyone</font>

361
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,400
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> look G isn't there something we can</font>

362
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,610
do just you know munch addresses around

363
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,260
and we said no<font color="#E5E5E5"> no you can't do that it</font>

364
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,570
won't scale it performance is lousy

365
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,920
there's security problems they and they

366
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,680
said no<font color="#CCCCCC"> no we really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need something</font>

367
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,170
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we gave them that and</font>

368
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,410
the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> was not actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked</font>

369
00:14:52,170 --> 00:15:00,010
didn't work well but it did work better

370
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,930
than in<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-existent v6 and it put off</font>

371
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:06,420
v6 implementation by a dozen<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

372
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:09,609
easily did it ever make sense well yes

373
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:12,069
we were running out of space we we were

374
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:14,410
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> still debating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too but and all</font>

375
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:17,500
sorts of other alternatives to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

376
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,900
became ipv6 back when we were almost out

377
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,190
and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just couldn't get it together</font>

378
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:25,660
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't widely available there was</font>

379
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:28,450
no dhcpv6 for another seven years people

380
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">were desperate they would take anything</font>

381
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I personally think there were</font>

392
00:15:53,790 --> 00:16:01,899
let me shoot on that one what we did was

393
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:04,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">we we were stuck with NAT and we were</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to make ourselves feel better so</font>

395
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:07,509
we were rationalizing that maybe there

396
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,949
was something actually good about this

397
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,449
whole thing where you have this one

<font color="#E5E5E5">public address in this whole slew of</font>

00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:25,480
initiate the connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so a that's</font>

403

not Matt that's the stateful firewall

reality has shown is that users are lazy

408

well that is not security as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

423
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:29,709
is a stateful firewall conflated with

00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:32,110
the address<font color="#E5E5E5"> translation if you want to</font>

425
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:34,510
have that protection there is no reason

00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can't have a public address on one</font>

427
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:39,000
side and multiple public addresses on

428
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:42,429
the other and get the same obscuring and

429
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,620
it will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> painful debugging</font>

430
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:46,389
it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the same congestion issues</font>

431
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,969

implementing that but of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course we we do</font>

440
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:12,070

00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:17,500

00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:24,190
no and if you say no you fail your audit

446
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:27,629
there will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be people particularly the US</font>

448
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:32,799
therefore even though the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF has said</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">NAT 66 will not happen we will never do</font>

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,340
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco and they will write a gnat 6</font>

they won't interoperate and they will

so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next marvelous thing the ITF</font>

470
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:28,990
talked about mac addresses they felt

00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:34,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">that mac addresses were fundamentally</font>

evil because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were not pure they are</font>

473
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,049
not always unique you can buy hardware

474
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:40,479
and you there are some scummy vendors

475
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:41,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we've all had them who will clone</font>

the mac address across<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple boxes</font>

477
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,090
and you're stuck you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can change it and</font>

478
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:47,649
software if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice person and</font>

479
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,509
pretty much all of the OSS will do that

480
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:51,370
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have multiple interfaces on</font>

481
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:53,710
the same box and you try and dhcp to the

482

same dhcp server<font color="#E5E5E5"> whichever interface</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">multiple addresses on the same box</font>

485
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:04,409
that's true what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF</font>

486
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:07,410
didn't consider was that yes all of

00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:10,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">those are flaws that are indeed part of</font>

488
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:12,240
mac addresses but ninety-nine point nine

489

nine percent of the entire universe<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets</font>

490
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,390
on to the internet via either a service

00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:20,340
provider or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company that uses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP and</font>

492
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:22,770
uses mac address and the internet hasn't

493
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,678
stopped working as a matter of fact it

494
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:28,049
it keeps on going so obviously while it

495
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,580
is not perfect it seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty</font>

496
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:32,429
workable solution for the vast majority

497
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,049
of the universe ah but the IETF knows

498
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:36,120
better than ninety-nine point nine nine

499
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:40,200
percent of the world so they came up

500
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the dhcp unique identifier and it</font>

501
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,830
does have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

502
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,100
definitely significantly better there is

503
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:50,879
one identifier / host either server or

504
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:53,428
client every network interface has an

505
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,110
identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> association</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IA that</font>

506
00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:58,049
identifies that particular network

507
00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:02,070
interface that pairing therefore is

508
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:05,549
unique so i can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> dhcp with the DUI pd</font>

509
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:07,200
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IA and get addresses and a</font>

510
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:09,120
different interface on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same box will</font>

511
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,700
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different I a so the dhcp server</font>

512
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:16,350
knows so we have solved the multiple

513
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:20,190
interface box problem and you can get

514
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:23,219
privacy addresses you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get regular</font>

515

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't just use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that as the key</font>

549
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,580
now I now clone that across 11 other

00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wipe the registry of the lease file</font>

00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:58,799
first I now have 12 machines with the

same duid and storage so going<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font>

554
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,870
why Mac is evil well multiple interfaces

00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:07,289
has been solved but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other two</font>

storage duid not guaranteed unique can

559

be altered in software so they have only

560
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,720
solved one third of the problems for a

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">fairly major paradigm shift and you</font>

709
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,420
lightweight which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people who</font>

710
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:23,770
are writing embedded device stacks and

00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,820
because they want it to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really small</font>

713
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:30,670
to fit in a very small amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flash</font>

716
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:40,060
slack is pretty straightforward so

717
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:41,439
things like remote devices or embedded

718
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,580
devices that are going to be popping up

719

<font color="#CCCCCC">because it is completely decentralized</font>

733
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,790
your priorities figure out which one is

734
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,020
more important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you one of the other</font>

738
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:25,990
that's fine if the staff is the local

cycle the right box most of the time

742
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,100
slack is going to be a much more sane

743
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:39,610
configuration and then again are you

744
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:43,780
dealing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of different gear and</font>

745
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:46,860
a couple of examples this again<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in</font>

configuration ms manage address that

752
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:06,370
means get all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other configuration</font>

754
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,689
in this example what I'm saying is a is

755

<font color="#CCCCCC">0</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't auto configure anything yourself</font>

756
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:15,550
oh NM get both your address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of</font>

757
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:16,990
your other configuration via<font color="#E5E5E5"> dhcp that's</font>

758
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:20,320
going to be as close<font color="#CCCCCC"> as possible to the</font>

759
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:21,700
current dhcp before the only thing

760
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,929
you'll be getting VRA would be default

761
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:26,020
route and then at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other end of the</font>

762
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:28,390
spectrum if a is one that says do your

763
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:31,300
own address Oh other configuration get

764
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:33,700
something probably DNS via<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP but</font>

765
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:38,080
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an address everything comes in</font>

766
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:41,020
the RA messages another interesting idea

767
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:46,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be useful at some point in</font>

time prefix delegation I can actually

769
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,580
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of giving you a dress I can</font>

770
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:53,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a whole prefix and</font>

771
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:57,639
then you can carve out chunks of that to

772
00:31:53,350 --> 00:32:00,760
subordinate routers below you so you can

773
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:03,970
dynamically create a hierarchical

774
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:07,390
network topology the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most common example</font>

775
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:11,800
given of this is a home where you give

776
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:13,600
the home router of 56 and then you might

777
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:16,000
have a router that is in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all of</font>

781
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,930
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting to that point where many</font>

point where that we're not flat space

787

but we'll get there potentially this is

788
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,570
very cool there are routers vendors and

we were running a fairly large ftp

we pretty regularly got pieces of email

00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,490
or occasionally faxes explaining that

848
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,169
they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble getting to our</font>

849
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,569
anonymous FTP server and that wasn't

850
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:23,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right and we got tired of</font>

851
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:24,040
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the stupidity so we decided</font>

852
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,260
that we were going to have an

853
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:28,540
intelligence test and the intelligence

854
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:32,619
test was that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could use VI and</font>

855
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:35,020
edit a IP sick or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> inadar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DARPA</font>

file and get a delegation correctly and

857
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:40,900
get anything at all into

858
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bar data portion of one of those PTR</font>

00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,260

860
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,210
that we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to respond to your</font>

00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,240
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> not do that obviously you were</font>

a<font color="#CCCCCC"> walking you should just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go away until</font>

864
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:57,160
you learned um unfortunately then what

865
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:58,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened was we started going well gee</font>

866
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,118
that did cut down some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our crap and</font>

867
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">we got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of tired of people with Q</font>

868
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,590
mail particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> because usually they</font>

869
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,210
couldn't get send mail working not being

00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:09,430
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exchange mail with us so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he said</font>

871
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:10,840
well let's give them the intelligence

872
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:12,399
test and this time around we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

873
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,869
say that the a and the PTR records have

874
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,320
to actually match each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other and if they</font>

875
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:21,850
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> match me to tell you go away</font>

876
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:24,520
unfortunately it escaped the lab and has

877
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:26,259
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> used on security and VPN collectors</font>

878
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,820
and they're even certain websites these

879
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,260
days that actually look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for things</font>

880
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I think the New York Times is one</font>

881
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:34,030
of them and so the answer is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

882
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:37,868
breaks if you don't have PTR records for

883
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:41,350
your users and since<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of us can't</font>

884
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:43,720
afford to staff for stupid calls we try

885
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:48,279
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be proactive and so we pre populate</font>

886
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:50,770
and so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it well occasionally</font>

887
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,960
we did by hand but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know well 256</font>

888
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:54,550
addresses wasn't that bad you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

889
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">of us knew how do you do clever things</font>

890
00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:01,150
in VI and emacs some of us wrote shell

891
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:03,670
script perl scripts find of course came

892
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:04,960
up with dollar generate some people were

893
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:08,170
even using their own homegrown IP

894
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,119
address management systems what we did

895
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,280
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pre populate everything we owned</font>

896
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:14,109
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything had a point of record</font>

897
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:18,490
whether it was used or not and then the

898
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:22,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem or away well for v6 so I've got</font>

899
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:28,330
one subnet 64 18 quintillion possible

900
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:32,319
addresses so a PTR record is 34 labels

901
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:35,440
long and even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I'm generously assuming</font>

902
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,660
that it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60 bytes in wire format</font>

903
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,590
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole record and our data per</font>

904
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:44,440
record 60 bytes x 18 quintillion which

905
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:46,450
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 billion times 4 billion anybody</font>

906
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">here got a computer that has either that</font>

907
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:50,290
much disk space or even less likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

908
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,569

file

910
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:58,720
yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the it defies</font>

911
00:37:56,769 --> 00:38:01,769
speed of light is is pretty much where

912
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:06,970
it gets too and that's 164 and you get

913
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:09,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">64,000 of those with a 48 so what do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

914
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,558
do well my personal vote is admit it was

915
00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:13,720
a bad idea and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said I was around</font>

916
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:15,309
we were stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lazy we have lived</font>

917
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,499
with it forever I apologize personally

918
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:18,910
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just tried to get out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of some</font>

919
00:38:17,499 --> 00:38:21,759
stupid emails because we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

920
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:24,368
paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it ever since unfortunately</font>

921
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:25,329
the reality is that our users probably

922
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:27,279
won't let us because there are enough

923
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:29,380
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are useful and of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

924
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:32,319
prix population well if we can exceed

925
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:34,869
speed of light we might figure out how

926
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:37,359
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not likely what is</font>

927
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:38,710
more likely is just like I recommend

928
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,839
static routing for things like your

929
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:43,150
router's your networking gear and your

930
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:44,558
large servers also by whatever means you

931
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:47,710
have your eye Pam system scripts

932
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:49,390
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre-populate the reverse</font>

933
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:51,130
pointers for all of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> boxes so</font>

934
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:53,200
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> trace route work so things</font>

935
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,839
like your mail MTA is not blocked by

936
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,910
people all of those good things then

937
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,920
odds are for most people most of us are

938
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:04,629
using DHCP for most of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> toast and</font>

transient hosts good Microsoft and ISC

940
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:08,829
will happily do zone updates or you can

941
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:12,999
let the client do it if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">issues with that the last possibility is</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when I was at ISC we had people</font>

the fly which works until you want to do

948

DNS SEC at which point you either break

949
00:39:29,499 --> 00:39:34,689
because DNS SEC shows your line or you

950

00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:48,819
an interesting self denial of service

958
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,570
right and as some people have also

959
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:04,819
pointed out in all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

understand how DNS sex signing of wild

962
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:13,760

964
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,050
so only mydomain.com is signed and I say

965
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:21,590
specifically only the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> two labels</font>

the fact that most of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a mac</font>

but to correlate before in v6 addresses

00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,400
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting thing for which</font>

991
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:31,669
there is a draft right now and nobody

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:34,220
has a good answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am a dual stack</font>

00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:56,360

them all if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I combine them all how do I</font>

1002
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:10,190
sort them OS vendors come to the ITF and

1003
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:12,010
say what<font color="#E5E5E5"> should we do and</font>

1004
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:20,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IHS says that's an operational issue</font>

1005
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:22,340
well yes it is um but most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us I think</font>

1006
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,630
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize having seen what happened</font>

1007
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,650
with happy eyeballs and all of the

1008
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:26,660
different versions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all the</font>

1009
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:29,170
different browsers did that it would be

1010
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:31,430
so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> better if all vos vendors had a</font>

1011
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:32,960
single way that they could all agree

1012
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,549
that they would take all of the stuff

1013
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,620
and stick it in so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you knew what</font>

1014
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:38,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">your etsy resolv.conf would be and not</font>

1015
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,100
have to know what every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> version</font>

1016
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:47,590
of every operating system did

1017
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:50,870
differently so um yeah I know it's I

1018
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:53,720
have carried a pager for an actual 15

1019
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:56,240
real years of time<font color="#CCCCCC"> in my life which</font>

1020
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">means that I don't like problems like</font>

1021
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:02,029
this because they mean I get paid your

1022
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:07,670
calls<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's usually mine one of the</font>

1023
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:08,960
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I do push on is because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1024
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:11,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and the fact that there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole</font>

1025
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:15,140
series of other operational issues the

1026
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:16,190
IETF when you first show up if you're a

1027
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,779
vendor they will really<font color="#E5E5E5"> beat you</font>

1028
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:20,990
senseless because obviously vendors are

1029
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:22,310
all evil but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're not a vendor</font>

1030
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,330
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were an operational guy that</font>

1031
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,770
will sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and go oh well you know</font>

1032
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,790
you operational guys you know if you

1033
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:28,040
were really clever you'd be writing

1034
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:31,340
protocols you have to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get past</font>

1035
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,990
that one and just keep working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them</font>

1036
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:37,040
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do eventually start</font>

1037
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:38,839
listening and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we all go away and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let</font>

1038
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,790
them do whatever they think with no

1039
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,220
connection to the reality we all live in

1040
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:46,640
we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be living with their decisions</font>

1041
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:48,589
and if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't say it it's like voting</font>

1042
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,690
if you don't vote you don't get to whine

1043
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:56,060
well you do get to wine but it's not

1044
00:43:50,690 --> 00:44:01,760
legit and so we need to vote we need to

1045
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:03,230
actually send folks there and if you

1046
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,640
can't convince your boss to go you

1047
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:06,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">should definitely be making sure that</font>

1048
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,509
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendors you buy gear from send</font>

1049
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,970
people and that should be one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

1050
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:12,950
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you participate in the IETF</font>

1051
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:15,049
actively do you send people to every

1052
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:16,520
meeting do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on the standards do</font>

1053
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:19,910
you keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> track do you know what's coming</font>

1054
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:21,770
down the pike because with v6 we have

1055
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:24,220
another couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> years of these drafts</font>

1056
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:28,580
coming through and changing

1057
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:30,919
and the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1058
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:33,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fact that a lot of this the ITF</font>

1059
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,480
somewhat legitimately is now reacting

1060
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:36,920
when someone comes in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> says gee this</font>

1061
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't work with my network it doesn't</font>

1062
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:42,320
work my provisioning system we need this

1063
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:43,819
new thing the ITF says well gee you know

1064
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,980
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been working on this for the last</font>

1065
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:47,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">seven or eight years where were you why</font>

1066
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:50,690
should we listen to you why<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you do</font>

1067
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:53,000
things the way we figured them out<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1068
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:55,640
to some degree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's legit because they</font>

1069
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,200
have already<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone through stuff like no</font>

1070
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:01,970
default<font color="#CCCCCC"> route in dhcp it's probably dead</font>

1071
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,140
it has been beaten so bloody at this

1072
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:07,810
point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one is going to stick</font>

1073
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:10,910
their head up and say what do we do but

1074
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:14,270
the reality is is that some people have

1075
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:18,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">worked around it John brofsky at comcast</font>

1076
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:21,170
went to the ITF the IETF said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

1077
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:24,200
stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> dhcp sucks this is all stupid mac</font>

1078
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:26,150
addresses are broken get over it and so

1079
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">john said well i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> customers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i need</font>

1080
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:32,240
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> this working so he went to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis</font>

1081
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:33,439
because he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF hey can you put</font>

1082
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,729
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> mender options they said oh yeah</font>

1083
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,260
you could put any you want vendor

1084
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:37,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">options that's what they're for you know</font>

1085
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a field they have your vendor get a</font>

1086
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:42,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of we don't care what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1087
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:44,060
there so<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said great he went to the</font>

1088
00:45:42,109 --> 00:45:46,160
doc says folks and he got standards done

1089
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,930
and they are now rolling out things that

1090
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">use the bender options and use docsis</font>

1091
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:52,430
three and it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it works for</font>

1092
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:54,980
comcast and all the vendors they work

1093
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:57,560
with well there are now other folks

1094
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:59,060
other ISPs and broadband ISPs who have

1095
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,650
been coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and saying well we don't</font>

1096
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,630
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way that breaks our whole</font>

1097
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:05,060
provisioning model we needed a change

1098
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:05,930
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> John quite legitimately says well</font>

1099
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:09,220
you know I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been beating myself</font>

1100
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:13,160
senseless for years now where were you

1101
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:17,118
show up and pick what's important

1102
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:21,160
because you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix everything so</font>

1103
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,160
that's a quick blast through yes

1104
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:33,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">yessum it yes yes and yes for the folks</font>

1105
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:35,520
that didn't hear um<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes you don't have</font>

1106
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,800
to go to the meeting showing up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1107
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,900
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group mailing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lists is showing</font>

1108
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:43,350
up and much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work is done there</font>

1109
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:45,060
and they have video casts and you can

1110
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:47,700
mail stuff to the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group chairs</font>

1111
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:50,370
and let them<font color="#CCCCCC"> know your vote on things</font>

1112
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:52,350
that are being discussed you can be a

1113
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:58,049
full and useful participant without ever

1114
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:59,940
physically showing up yeah they're there

1115
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:02,130
they are very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> at at all of the</font>

1116
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:05,430
normal they have chat they have jabbered

1117
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:07,110
they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> video cast they have email so</font>

1118
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,790
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of ways to participate</font>

1119
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:10,650
because yeah they it's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1120
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:12,270
world it's expensive this is the first

1121
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:15,780
job I've ever had where I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been sent</font>

every ITF and not work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone like</font>

1123
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:20,760
a mega left like Cisco so I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

1124
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:23,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">it quickly because I figure they're</font>

1125
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:27,840
probably a lot of questions on things

1126
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:30,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you have dealt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with or wandering on</font>

1127
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:33,960
holes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know gee we do it this way</font>

1128
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:35,580
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that going to work and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> b6 so if you</font>

1129
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:45,210
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go ahead and step the microphone</font>

1130
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:49,049
and ask away yeah this will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fun one</font>

1131
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:51,810
high lifes lawyer from Alaska and pretty

1132
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:53,790
much it displays everything so I i work

1133
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:57,990
for a telecommunications company up

1134
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:59,640
there a three-letter one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm in a</font>

1135
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:04,759
proponent of ipv6 for probably the last

1136
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:07,859
12<font color="#CCCCCC"> years there and in trying to get the</font>

1137
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:10,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">the company to start looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at ipv6</font>

1138
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:13,830
internally you know work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IT</font>

1139
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:18,570
system architect and we have to follow

1140
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:22,290
pci guidelines so they want net mm-hm

1141
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:24,180
and so when I said well give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a</font>

1142
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:26,670
proposal for what your plans for ipv6

1143
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:31,169
rollout would include and so their site

1144
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:36,900
local addresses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> locate yeah and I</font>

1145
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:39,000
look at it and I'm wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> why are</font>

1146
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,700
we allowing that kind of thing to

1147
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,070
propagate because it just breaks so many

1148
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:47,250
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> within a large business</font>

1149
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:51,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm looking I guess for for help and</font>

1150
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:53,100
how I can combat that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt right so</font>

1151
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:54,480
there are several pieces all right right

1152
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:56,970
so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them site local has been</font>

1153
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">deprecated if you want to use 1918 now</font>

1154
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:01,379
use unique local that was another one of

1155
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:04,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">the unique local was supposed to be</font>

1156
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:06,390
within one area site local was supposed

1157
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:09,360
to be across an entire enterprise but

1158
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:13,710
they can never define what site meant so

1159
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:15,900
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave up as far as the nap yes that</font>

1160
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:18,780
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reality that's like I said wine</font>

1161
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,640
at 66 or some equivalent will happen but

1162
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality is is the security peace</font>

1163
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:28,500
that they are looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for actually is</font>

1164
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:33,419
the stateful firewall so my reaction is

1165
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:36,360
normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> use gusa for everything and go</font>

1166
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,700
through and then use stateful firewall

1167
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:40,200
there are however NAT solutions out

1168
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:42,000
there including<font color="#CCCCCC"> quote unquote</font>

1169
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">carrier-grade nap that are certainly</font>

1170
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,830
functional if you want to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1171
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:48,900
kind of money there are things that will

1172
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:53,310
function for those and ula isn't

1173
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:56,250
horrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I look at things like 19 18</font>

1174
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:58,710
addresses and views in DNS and certain

1175
00:49:56,250 --> 00:50:00,960
other things as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's your absolute last</font>

1176
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:03,480
choice after you've exhausted all other

1177
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,280
possible more sane and more scalable and

1178
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,590
more supportable technical solutions if

1179
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,570
what is left is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that then implement it</font>

1180
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:12,900
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have exhausted all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

1181
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:16,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">Possible's first unfortunately when you</font>

1182
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:18,000
get into blind compliance rules where

1183
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:22,140
it's a check box where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yes or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

1184
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:25,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you say no you fail we have a lot</font>

1185
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:26,400
less flexibility and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suspect that</font>

00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:31,290
you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those lucky</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1187
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:33,540
rolling out a nap 66 yeah which which

1188
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:35,279
makes me cringe but unfortunately and I

1189
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:37,100
suspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that PCI and hip and a few other</font>

1190
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:40,620
people that blindly go through but

1191
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:45,060
what's your take so first of all pc<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1192
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:46,680
actually does provide for you you don't

1193
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:48,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you can show that</font>

1194
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,379
you've got equivalent

1195
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:52,540
security right which are the stateful

1196
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:55,120
firewall is and the stateful firewall

1197
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:56,920
qualifies for that and about forty

1198

percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PCI auditors have now</font>

fool enough to understand that better

probably don't actually want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to yeah</font>

die die die was my intro slide so it

1218
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,180
sort of gives my opinion on what we

1219
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be doing with it but there are</font>

1220
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:50,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain realities there a whole series</font>

1221
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,150
of education things including also how

1222
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,710
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I justify you know so it makes my</font>

1223
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,600
network more expensive it makes my

1224
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:57,220
network more brittle X but I expend all

1225
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,690
this more money and it doesn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

1226
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:01,660
anything better that's another one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1227
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:04,090
those how to yeah right exactly and so

1228
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:05,799
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I justify spending for ipv6 um</font>

1229
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:10,180
it's another one of the common questions

1230
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:13,870
but go ahead my name is Andrew Sullivan

1231
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:16,690
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am a protocol weenie and I just</font>

1232
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:18,730
want to say in line<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this NAT 66</font>

1233
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:20,590
stuff and the other vendor thing you are

1234
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:22,510
mentioning a minute ago be careful what

1235
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:24,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">you wish for here there are lots of</font>

1236
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:27,460
vendors who want to sell this crap and

1237
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:29,230
so part of a call for participation is

1238
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:31,330
both you know towards the auditing types

1239
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:32,860
and towards the standards people we need

1240
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:34,900
real operators who are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1241
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:36,490
saying no this is a stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea the</font>

1242
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,750
first time we're certainly not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1243
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:40,299
do it now when we got all this address

1244
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:42,460
space it's it's super critical on this

1245
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:44,920
issue we got to get real operators in

1246
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:46,060
the room yes and and along those lines

1247
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,160
where I was talking about carrier-grade

1248
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:50,020
NAT one of the things that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1249
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,940
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> folks are now pushing is well you</font>

1250
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:54,610
get v6 native and you let<font color="#CCCCCC"> that go out</font>

1251
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:55,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">and all of your v4 stuff will get</font>

1252
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:59,500
carrier-grade matted and they say well

1253
00:52:55,990 --> 00:53:01,720
hey it works for LTE and cellular and

1254
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:04,840
and i have several responses one of them

1255
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:08,348
is yes it works for a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> valor</font>

1256
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:10,750
value if you want to keep giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

1257
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:12,700
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Huawei or Cisco insane numbers of</font>

1258
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,109
dollars forever because they are

1259
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:17,830
certainly happy to keep selling you

1260
00:53:14,109 --> 00:53:20,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware forever the other thing is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1261
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:23,290
yes currently forty percent of all

00:54:54,339 --> 00:54:59,650
guys will start noticing so we will

1304
00:54:56,589 --> 00:55:02,259
start cashing up on those debts and

1305

00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:15,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think they've thought out</font>

1313
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,640
means for<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone public address on</font>

1314
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:23,350
there you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get 64,000 simultaneous</font>

1315
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,819

1316
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:27,640
that's not a person anymore even a

1317

1320
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,840
common to have three smartphones in two

00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,490
iPads in an awful lot of houses right

1322

now all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> which are acting like</font>

1323
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:43,330
browsers so my guess is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

1324
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:44,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">get to the point where realistically you</font>

00:55:43,330 --> 00:55:48,340
could probably have one to two thousand

1329
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:57,569
getting more space is going to be

1330
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:59,920
punitive Lee expensive as well so

1331
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:01,720
getting enough address space on the

1332
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,550

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good news</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the fact that</font>

that business case also why should I

outstripping the address space faster

to be in non-compliance or to be

non-compliance than to do the right

1384
00:58:56,539 --> 00:59:11,569
thing which I hate but is indeed

1385
00:58:58,699 --> 00:59:17,689
economic<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality so forty percent of</font>

00:59:31,009 --> 00:59:36,880
and their slides with presentation yeah
