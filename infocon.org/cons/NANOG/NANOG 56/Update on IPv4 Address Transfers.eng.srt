quite a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them actually this is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that you need address space and you</font>

19
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,860
satisfy your need up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> two years at</font>

20
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,090
this point and you don't like the small

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,400
three month increments that we're giving

22
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,290
out of the free pool you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can avail</font>

26
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,080
additional dress space so it's worth

27
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:25,110
knowing about we don't approve all the

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,009
have all been approved and transferred

31
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,100
and in these<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases these have we've</font>

32
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,600
worked with the parties to make sure

33
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,000
that the bankruptcy language adequately

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,210
reflects what the community wants that

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,290
the iron policies are met and satisfied

36
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:44,429
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the rights that are being</font>

37
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,130
transferred are in accordance with

38
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:51,149
policy we've had great success actually

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">we the bankruptcy community has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come to</font>

41
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,939
very well we do deny some that's what I

42
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,649
was going to say what do we deny let's

43
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,119
see you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to transfer to a party</font>

44
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,460
that's not a network operator and

45
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,049
doesn't need addresses you'll get turned

46
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,169
down because they can't document their

47
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,879
operational need if you have to transfer

48
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,040
blocks and you're not the actual

49
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,950
register on we turn you<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

50
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,340
I don't know why spammers are surprised

51
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this a lot actually if you attempt to</font>

transfer block sizes smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the</font>

minimum we have minimums in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy</font>

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,920
right now that includes a / 24 if you

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,439
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to transfer something smaller you're</font>

56
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,450
denied there's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good reasons for</font>

57
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that as well because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we all have routing</font>

58
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,890
tables to worry about and request the

59
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,480
transfer blocks larger than needed by

60
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,849
the recipient this is where<font color="#CCCCCC"> people get a</font>

61
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">little upset you find someone who has a</font>

nice / 16 you want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> continue</font>

65
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,319
over the next two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years I'm very sorry</font>

66
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,329
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to end up transferring only</font>

67
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,988
<font color="#CCCCCC">in 18 that's all we can allow under</font>

68
00:02:54,329 --> 00:03:00,930
policy so but it has been working well

69
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:04,019
has been successful in fact we've had

70
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:07,650
our first now under n<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpm 8.4 our first</font>

71
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:09,689
in Terraria our transfer the 8.4 in

72
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,689
Terraria transfer policy allows us to

73
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:14,760
transfer to another ar-ar-ar recipient

74
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:18,239
another re our region who has compatible

75
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,459
policy we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> one / 24 block of ipv4</font>

76
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,109
addresses transferred to an AP Nick

77
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,690
member under the inter<font color="#CCCCCC"> rer transfer</font>

78
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:26,159
policy so that's good to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

79
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">very important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

80
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,090
regions who might need address space

81
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,030
since there seems to be a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it in</font>

82
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,489
the iron region for historical reasons

83
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:38,489
so it's been going well we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very happy</font>

84
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,650
to administer these policies most people

85
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:43,139
are able to make them work<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

86
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a set of facilitators who are</font>

87
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,729
experienced in these policies if you go

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Aaron website and you're clicking</font>

find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list on the right-hand bar of</font>

agreed by contract to follow irons

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,439
help you get your address space to

combination<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the policies and the</font>

98
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:16,048
facilitators seems to be going very well

99
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,649
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list of them they are in</font>

100
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:21,478
registered transfer facilitators and it

101
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,219
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to use them but if you</font>

103
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:30,080
right place that's an option that

104
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:37,250
it very short update any questions

105
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:40,270
microphones are open everything's so

106
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:44,510
simple there's no questions on transfers

107
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:48,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wow I'm having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> disbelief errands so easy</font>

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,849
to work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's great Lee Howard</font>

109
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,229
Time Warner Cable are you sure I know

110
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,630
the answer is pretty sure I know your

111
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:56,810
answer this question it's a fairly

112
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:59,090
opaque market mm-hmm you is there any

113
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,310
I'm sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron doesn't know</font>

114
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,400
necessarily what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> what prices people</font>

115
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,139
are getting for directing the transfers

116
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,380
are there any resources that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

117
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:12,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">aware of that would allow sunlight or</font>

118
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:16,100
some transparency into the opacity of

119
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:18,169
this market so but<font color="#E5E5E5"> information we</font>

120
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,450
collect and<font color="#E5E5E5"> report is what people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

121
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:22,310
passed according to policy so that means

122
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,949
all we're reporting at present is the

123
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,260
normal Aaron daily issued files that

124
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,669
show what's been transferred there was

125
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,349
some discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the policy was</font>

126
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:33,729
adopted about<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether or not we should</font>

127
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:36,500
be requesting additional information

00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:40,400
information such as requests that were

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:43,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">turned down information such as when</font>

requests did go through what the

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,820
recipient what price they paid

132
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,789
information like that we haven't we

133

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> collect that we can it comes down</font>

134

to policy and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> about four hours there</font>

and meaning will kick off and you guys

136
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,000
know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make policy so if you want</font>

137
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:01,430
to have us collect more information feel

free to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I'm probably</font>

the lack of consistent data among the

required

155
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:45,229
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not asking for additional</font>

information<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will note that however</font>

157
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:51,378
there's a list of facilitators and they

158
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:53,659
all seem to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very plugged in to what's</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and what seems to be right I'm</font>

164
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,878
you a lot of insight<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the market but</font>

165
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:08,719
if you think Aaron should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing more</font>

166
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:14,689
welcome to hear about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new policy</font>

167
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:17,899
proposal<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay any other questions people</font>

168
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:20,449
who have challenges with the policy

169

there's an errand<font color="#E5E5E5"> help desk out front</font>

171
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:30,969
we're pretty easy to work with but it is

172
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:34,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">true that there can be effort at times</font>

173
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:37,519
it's not trivial and the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

174
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:39,409
matter is that it's as hard as if it is

175
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult if we are hard to work with</font>

176
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:44,089
it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the policies that you</font>

177
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:46,669
folks want us to enforce and we're as

178
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:48,889
hard as you make us so the good news is

182

parties trying to help you as

184
00:07:56,029 --> 00:08:02,149

185
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:06,229
options<font color="#CCCCCC"> there hi is right wonder why it</font>

186
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:09,499
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaf embel just curious about the</font>

187
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:11,839
transfer if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the recipient IP address</font>

188
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:14,839
utilization has not hit eighty percent

189
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:17,389
is it a has hot and fast rule that you

190
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:19,069
will not approve the transfer yeah the

191
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:21,229
recipient is that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

192
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:24,679
the recipients total address space when

193
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:27,199
the transaction is complete so at the

194
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:29,149
end of the time we look at at the end of

195
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,610
24 months because that's the current

196
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:33,698
policy what will the recipients total

197
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:37,039
address space and total utilization be

198
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:39,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so you can get address space that</font>

199
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,348
you don't need today but it's based on

200
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,729
your 24 month growth curve and you have

201
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:45,559
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a situation where you will</font>

202
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:50,629
utilize that to eighty percent with it

203
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:53,260
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of 24 months okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yes</font>
