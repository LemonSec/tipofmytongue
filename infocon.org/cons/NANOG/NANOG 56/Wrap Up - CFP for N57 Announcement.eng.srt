people on the screen so<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think</font>

00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:55,830
so statistics 599 I should have

146
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:59,190
registered<font color="#CCCCCC"> tigger we could gone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 600 580</font>

147
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">on site attendee so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he means we got 19</font>

148
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,210
people to pay us and not show up that

149
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,100
was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of cool 158 newcomers</font>

150
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:06,859
that's actually slightly lower than

151
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,750
average but you know what we'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

152
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,940
the newcomer breakfast was actually more

153
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,850
better attended than the ones I've seen

154
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,469
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> past that's I like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 11</font>

155
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,210
students like to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that up if you guys</font>

156
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,860
know any students can you have them come

157
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,120
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you know they're our future</font>

158
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,470
and every other buzz word you can think

159
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,840
of but they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come and see what</font>

160
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,580
the real world is like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

161
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,560
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have people who have basic</font>

162
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,390
knowledge come in because some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font>

163
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,450
weren't trained<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way but they also</font>

164
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,520
need the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other half of it 27 speakers a</font>

165
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:39,300
hundred members there's actually what is

166
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,969
it 388 I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is 388 members is</font>

167
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:49,050
that right yeah 388 members a hundred of

168
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:52,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">them 183 333 sorry 333 members and 100</font>

169
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,790
of them are here that means 233 people

170
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,100
paid to be members<font color="#E5E5E5"> and didn't even come</font>

171
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:58,560
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference I think that's support</font>

172
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,600
for the community that's really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> 64</font>

173
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,220
sponsor represent those the reason that

174
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,050
by the way in case it isn't clear the

175
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,730
reason we break these out is because

176
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,710
they pay different amounts are not at

177
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:09,840
all so the sponsor representatives can

178
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:12,090
actually come without paying the 450 or

179
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,130
whatever dollars instead because you buy

180
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,320
a five-thousand-dollar break you get one

181
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,210
or two I forget people that can come and

182
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,580
stand at the break table which i think

183
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,080
is fair<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make sense but trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

184
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,510
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> and honest this is how it breaks</font>

185
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,460
out when you come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> walk in</font>

186
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,590
registrations we love to have a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

187
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,760
those because we charge them extra but

188
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,409
not too many because<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it screws up</font>

189
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,718
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of cookies we</font>

190
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:37,669
have to buy 16 cancellations have been

191
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:40,289
paid no shows and<font color="#CCCCCC"> two non-paid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no shows</font>

192
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,360
countries shockingly the United<font color="#E5E5E5"> States</font>

193
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:45,930
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vast majority of people coming to</font>

194
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,460
nanog I am surprised Canada being the

195
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:51,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">other part of North America as far as</font>

196
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:53,010
Aaron's concerned is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next best then</font>

197
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,300
comes Japan Germany and Brazil we

198
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually have a couple other countries</font>

199
00:08:54,300 --> 00:09:00,170
there I think that's a little lower than

200
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:04,400
the normal list but we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

201
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:07,290
organization descriptions this is really

202
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that you guys can see the type and</font>

203
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,719
breadth of people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> come to nanog it</font>

204
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,300
isn't just a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs or Google and</font>

205
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,850
Microsoft it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a massive number</font>

206
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,400
of different types of organizations and

207
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,870
you'll also notice the some people talk

208
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,459
about the fact that like at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

209
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,050
past not so much anymore but like Cisco

210
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,300
you send 40 people to nanog are they

211
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,670
taking over down on well clearly that's

212
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,380
not even close to the case anymore so

213
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,270
it's really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can come here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

214
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,910
can talk to just about anybody and you

215
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:38,130
get a nice wide breadth<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I can't think</font>

216
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:42,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a better way to say that nanog is</font>

217
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:44,910
useful and functional so some

218
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,860
reflections this is actually for me hi

219
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:50,490
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name's Patrick I'm an outgoing board</font>

220
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,870
member I was termed out see two and a

221
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,570
half years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> I walked around to the</font>

222
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,950
other at the time they were called

223
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,330
steering committee members and I said

224
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,779
hey you know what I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's time that</font>

225
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,580
we become our own organization and I'm

226
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,800
proud to say that there was unanimous

227
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,380
agreement and we decided that we do is

228
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,699
create our own nonprofit and we all

229
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,779
thought about it we sat down and we went

230
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,339
you know it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be really hard</font>

231
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we have you know some support and</font>

232
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,520
and we had all these plans and of course

233
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:17,010
it was nothing like<font color="#CCCCCC"> what actually</font>

234
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,470
happened instead it was a lot harder

235
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">than we thought but we were far far far</font>

236
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,890
more successful than we ever thought no

237
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,630
one in our wildest<font color="#E5E5E5"> dreams thought that</font>

238
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,610
in two and a half years we'd have half a

239
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,770
million dollars in the bank that we'd

240
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:31,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">have 600 people coming to an anon that</font>

241
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:34,709
nobody would notice the transition that

242
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">the rules and regulations would be you</font>

243
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:39,180
know well defined that people would

244
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:42,540
participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> our original spreadsheets</font>

245
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,279
had 100 members as you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top-line</font>

246
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,329
estimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that was like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we could</font>

247
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:49,650
get to 100 we'd be happy we have 333

248
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,660
what's more is that I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> proud of</font>

249
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,880
the community for standing up and doing

250
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,920
what we said we would do and for you

251
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,260
guys supporting us<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron supporting us</font>

252
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,630
and John left to use to be sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

253
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,130
there Aaron stepped right up didn't even

254
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,589
blink and said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys need some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font>

255
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,180
we know you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> good for it here's some</font>

256
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:08,170

257

259
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,649
right here in the front row he was a

260
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,110
member<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the steering committee</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

261
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:19,480
even though he was you know the steering

262
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,920
committee had term limits when his term

263
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,690
came up even though we had changed to an

264
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">or new organization he stood up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and said</font>

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,720
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm not going to change</font>

267
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,589
what the community expects everybody to

268
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:32,349
do and he stood down just like

269
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:36,550
everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> made that one for</font>

270

instance self you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

back his pride in doing what<font color="#E5E5E5"> he decided</font>

was right for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community made</font>

everyone else feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the nanog board</font>

275
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:49,149
was standing up and doing what it

276
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,310
thought was right for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community not</font>

277
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,690
for itself now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm doing the same thing</font>

278
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,829
although it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not as tough for me</font>

279
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:58,269
because I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the hell out but</font>
