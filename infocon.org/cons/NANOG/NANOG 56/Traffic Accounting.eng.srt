1
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:15,360
it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you guys you can use those</font>

2
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">mics if you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be good start in</font>

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,609
just a couple minutes here everyone find

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,609
your seats please

5
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,500
you

6
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,180
the laptops

7
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,740
you

8
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:36,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">I took her all right everyone welcome</font>

9
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,359
back for lunch if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were at that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plush</font>

10
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,709
nightclub event last night good morning

11
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,310
that was a pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> event so thanks</font>

12
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:46,410
to Cyrus wine<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netflix and brocade this</font>

13
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,680
morning or this afternoon ha caught me

14
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:52,680
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do a panel that Lisa yes</font>

15
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,090
in Scott I practice that name has put

16
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:07,410
together for us on traffic counting

17
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:09,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Alisa thank you alright welcome back</font>

18
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:13,920
after lunch I hope no one is falling

19
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:17,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">asleep this is the traffic accounting</font>

20
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,798
panel and I'm Elise is in sky<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let me</font>

21
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,560
start out with introducing our panelists

22
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,209
of the day in the in the spirit of

23
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,579
traffic accounting we have assembled

24
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,590
everyone get up guys we have assembled

25
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:31,200
everyone in an up and to the right

26
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,440
formation just so it looks a little bit

27
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:39,810
like a graph up in front works well

28
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:43,319
right so we have Paulo chanta up here on

29
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,600
the bottom side he works for Karen and

30
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,608
technologies and he's the author of the

31
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">open-source flow accounting software</font>

32
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:54,060
p.m. acct we have bran<font color="#CCCCCC"> fenderson he's</font>

33
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,790
with limelight networks and he's been

34
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,420
heavily involved in<font color="#CCCCCC"> limelight striving</font>

35
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:03,630
accounting software<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up he will tell</font>

36
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,268
you all about it later then we have our

37
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,720
en fine who was a head of engineering

38
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,639
now at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anne's excite belief and he's</font>

39
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,940
been working a lot on different tools

40
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:17,220
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> amex has in place for traffic</font>

41
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,219
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> collared correlation and all</font>

42
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,900
kinds of performance metrics and then we

43
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,389
have Aaron who's going to be the first

44
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:29,960
one up here in a minute given us an

45
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:33,680
introduction into the subject slides oh

46
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,680
here we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay perfect</font>

47
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,460
so let's start out<font color="#CCCCCC"> with just a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

48
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:43,409
bit of background and then I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

49
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:46,438
pass this on to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron here what we all</font>

50
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:49,050
need we all need some form of insight

51
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:53,009
and visibility into our traffic into our

52
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:55,770
networks to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to plan to forecast</font>

53
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:58,110
to troubleshoot we need we need data for

54
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:01,378
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we need intelligence once we have</font>

55
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,120
that data collected out of various

56
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:06,210
software solutions that are out there we

57
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,680
will be getting into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need to</font>

58
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,500
correlate and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present that</font>

59
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,180
data somehow and all of this are

60
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,610
different pieces of the puzzle and all

61
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:20,819
of them require a lot of engineering

62
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:24,779
assembling of different parts and it's

63
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:27,659
all a big effort so far in various

64
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:29,490
networks to to put the tip of the

65
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:33,150
presentation together that you in the

66
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:35,580
end need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

67
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,679
network and say I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem here I</font>

68
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,508
have a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> there this is how I need</font>

69
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:45,449
to plan this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how I need to build out</font>

70
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:49,139
this is how I need to forecast there Oh

71
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:51,150
slides here so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> various tools</font>

72
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,789
out there open source and not open

73
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,219
source that people use maybe let's do a

74
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:59,990
real quick show of hands who is using

75
00:05:56,219 --> 00:06:04,560
SNMP tools mr TG etc in their network

76
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:08,039
get data that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a bit ok who is</font>

77
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,779
using any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow data collection</font>

78
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:14,310
in their networks that's quite a bit as

79
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:18,810
well ok but<font color="#CCCCCC"> less than them SNMP side all</font>

80
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:22,979
right especially the especially the flow

81
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:29,069
side of things is not as easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grasp</font>

82
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:31,339
as the sand<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap1 so many correlations</font>

83
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:34,500
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to know</font>

84
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:36,300
you wouldn't you would like to see a s

85
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,330
path prefixes you would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

86
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,659
which is am i pushing traffic to wear

87
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:45,960
all of that requires to correlate with

88
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:50,969
bgp with<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP and all kinds of data</font>

89
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:52,979
on your network so all the tools unless

90
00:06:50,970 --> 00:07:09,300
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using an off-the-shelf appliance</font>

91
00:06:52,979 --> 00:07:12,960
need tools smithing and work<font color="#CCCCCC"> to please</font>

92
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:17,789
sign on cell phones yeah I should turn

93
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:20,489
off my phone alright so the problems

94
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:22,919
that we're facing is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a lot</font>

95
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,340
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on sysadmin site on database</font>

96
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,960
aight on collection on the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

97
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,000
is out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put all of it together</font>

98
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,239
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different pieces and build</font>

99
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,550
something out of that especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> re n</font>

100
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,159
and brand are going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

101
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,289
different solutions that<font color="#CCCCCC"> amex and the</font>

102
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:46,830
limelight networks have in place and put

103
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:48,449
up to collect<font color="#CCCCCC"> data and let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start out</font>

104
00:07:46,830 --> 00:08:02,159
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of an introduction</font>

105
00:07:48,449 --> 00:08:06,840
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> subject by Aaron all yours</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

106
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:08,070
good after lunch food coma so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

107
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,580
just talking a bit about about

108
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:13,680
traditional tools that we've used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

109
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,440
accounting data hopefully these are more

110
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,349
historical than current but to lay the

111
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,340
groundwork<font color="#E5E5E5"> the majority</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of us use for</font>

112
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:26,009
you know either traditional SNMP

113
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:28,198
something like 95th percentiles have had

114
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:30,570
some challenges over the recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> years in</font>

115
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,820
interface growth moving from things like

116
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:34,770
32-bit counters to 64-bit counters

117
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,020
having some role of our problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

118
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,809
mean times and challenges converting old

119
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,968
graphs the new graphs it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

120
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:43,880
the greatest solution for billing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

121
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,800
tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use it all over the place</font>

122
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,680
regardless which is always surprising

123
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,260
it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a snapshot and will hold a</font>

124
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,109
fairly accurate month of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

125
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,040
think we've you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know all settled on</font>

126
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety-fifth for very good reasons</font>

127
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,829
related to SNMP and certainly the

128
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,150
storage

129
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:05,500
our d style collection for SNMP is

130
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:09,069
really challenging to go back in history

131
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:11,380
and find accurate data due to averaging

132
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,900
over time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course that data volume</font>

133
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,070
going down you know certainly I'm sure

134
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,660
all of you have had calls from a

135
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,520
customer going I'm disputing the bill

136
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,069
that's a year old or a six month year or

137
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">six month old and pulling up all data</font>

138
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,700
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just doesn't work we end up doing</font>

139
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">ridiculous things like taking the screen</font>

140
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,680
captures every month and also

141
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,170
differentiating internal and external

142
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,849
traffic is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also is challenging you know</font>

143
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,620
if you have customers for example that

144
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,850
have multiple interfaces and vlans and

145
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,500
might do things like database

146
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,700
synchronization between their own ports

147
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,980
you're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> counting all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that data</font>

148
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,080
and they're being built for it crossing

149
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:48,220
you know they're there be land rather

150
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,510
than the external edges so it's a it's a

151
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,610
you know it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oly been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using it</font>

152
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:55,390
for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years but it certainly got</font>

153
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:57,790
its challenges of course there's

154
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,860
something like traditional DPI<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

155
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:03,040
know the word traditional here is is is

156
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,530
broad there are a lot of ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do deep</font>

157
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,680
packet inspection mirroring copying the

158
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:12,069
ports but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not many many things that can</font>

159
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,329
track to tap ports very well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

160
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,190
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a bunch of cards out</font>

161
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:17,680
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example that will tap traffic</font>

162
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,750
like in days cards<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you that</font>

164
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,730
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot with processing other than the</font>

165
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,470
online rate and certainly if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

166
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,000
doing this kind of traffic analysis to

167
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,620
capture things you're actually tripling

168
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,300
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> travel your traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flowing because</font>

169
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,740
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole pipe plus a copy of</font>

170
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,990
the transmitted and a copy of the

171
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,760

172
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,980
some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of central location for doing</font>

173
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,630
any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis that you know the</font>

174
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,160
triple volume becomes more and more as

175
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,200
they pass your aggregate wings so you're

176
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,969
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending huge amounts of traffic's</font>

177
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,530
off into central locations which means

178
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,290
you end up spreading them out all over

179
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:51,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the place for this triple volume to do</font>

180
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">these local analytics and then passing</font>

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">the analytic result back to some other</font>

183
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,860
serious io limitations right you can't

184
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">really write this fast a disk or</font>

185

186
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,430
analytics for tap words they just don't

187
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,930
work all that well today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and even if you</font>

189
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:12,099
data processing is a real pain right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

190
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,560
analytics actually takes so long that

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not</font>

193
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,840
and summarize data and roll it over and

194
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,310
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crashes or you</font>

195

196
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:24,949
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real pain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

197
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,360
really are truly doing you know some

198
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:28,670
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tapping and processing and</font>

199
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,770
analytics you<font color="#E5E5E5"> expose yourself some do</font>

200
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,209
some privacy issues where you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

201
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,670
allowed to be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific things with</font>

202
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:38,440
these traffic and as a carrier people

203
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:40,810
don't like the idea of tapping ports

204
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,040
there's also of course traditional flow

205
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,319
it has its problems right you got

206
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,910
multiple versions to deal with and the

207
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,710
biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of course is that vendors</font>

208
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:53,959
treat flow differently on different

209
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:55,730
versions of router software and and it's

210
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,529
a real pain to continually update which

211
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:01,430
interfaces are considered egress and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

212
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,839
Gress for tagging for flow data and

213
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,459
sampling is always a big challenge right

214
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,200
your sample rates you're looking for

215
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,790
accuracy but at the same time you don't

216
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,380
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give up your processing power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

217
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,390
your router and if you're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

218
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">high sampling rates you could end up</font>

219
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:15,529
really killing a router from things like

220
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,720
a DDoS attack where it amplifies it

221
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:20,300
getting all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's which traffic in</font>

222
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the flow as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well so these are just some</font>

223
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,430
samples of sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some traditional</font>

224
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,540
versions of of collection and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

225
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,130
there's all kinds of traditional

226
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,949
visualization tools that go with it

227
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:33,320
things like our d tool cacti<font color="#CCCCCC"> our TG</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

228
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,839
kinds of homegrown tools PNG<font color="#CCCCCC"> JPEG</font>

229
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,640
libraries whatever you've done very

230
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,910
simple examples of traditional

231
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:42,350
visualization but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

232
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,719
about emerging trends<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pass</font>

233
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:47,200
it to Palo to start off with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

234
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,200
example

235
00:12:51,619 --> 00:13:01,079
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> paolo so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i bring here</font>

236
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:04,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially two slides and traditional</font>

237
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:06,899
and emerging just to make a point that a

238
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,539
traffic accounting azan is not a new

239
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:13,109
discipline<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all it's in a sense it's</font>

240
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:16,079
not rocket science but you know times

241
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:18,479
are evolving and traffic accounting is

242
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,299
something that is evolving as well with

243
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:25,799
time so it's a drawing units that are

244
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:28,858
coming you know from the market or and

245
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:33,839
the traffic accounting is is or should

246
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:37,289
be following<font color="#E5E5E5"> with those needs so among</font>

247
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:40,169
the traditional trends of what traffic

248
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:42,479
accounting has<font color="#CCCCCC"> being used for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

249
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:45,329
years it's a number of items that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

250
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:48,629
see on this slide so one interesting

251
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:50,909
thing is how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> times I face two</font>

252
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:52,679
people that still think that traffic

253
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:55,919
accounting equates want one with

254
00:13:52,679 --> 00:14:01,049
security well<font color="#E5E5E5"> security is of course</font>

255
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:03,449
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> an evergreen topic let's say but</font>

256
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:05,129
it's a definitely not the only topic

257
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:08,059
that you can address with traffic

258
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:10,439
accounting so as of myself as being as

259
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:12,629
specializing or doing a lot of work in

260
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:15,238
the past and also currently on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

261
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:16,589
two items of this slide so capacity

262
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:20,969
planning traffic engineering and

263
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:24,569
especially analyzing internet peering

264
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:29,579
and transit by using traffic accounting

265
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:34,799
and specifically flow data<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting to</font>

266
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:36,118
the emerging needs let's say I see this

267
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,009
this light doesn't want to be

268
00:14:36,119 --> 00:14:39,659
comprehensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> and also the one on the</font>

269
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:41,639
traditional trends doesn't want to be

270
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:45,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">comprehensive but let's say I work with</font>

271
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:48,089
the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of service providers let's</font>

272
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:51,569
say and this is the most popular things

273
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:53,969
that seem to pop up over time so the

274
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:57,569
first is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really a sad way from the</font>

275
00:14:53,969 --> 00:15:00,089
previous slide so<font color="#E5E5E5"> traditionally we have</font>

276
00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:02,279
been so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen on the previous</font>

277
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:03,360
slide there is analyzing internet

278
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,019
appearing and

279
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,600
and in transit so just looking at

280
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:12,779
traffic ratios and amount of traffic

281
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,279
exchanges and I mean the most exciting

282
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:17,250
thing that traditional has been doing in

283
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:19,260
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> area was you know 95 percentile and</font>

284
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:22,110
you if you really wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get even</font>

285
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,240
more excited aggregated calculations so

286
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,459
we make a single volume of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

287
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,709
interfaces that you are for example

288
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:32,189
peering with another party and you would

289
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:33,989
do a 95 percentile out of that but now

290
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:37,790
things are changing right so it's

291
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:40,680
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the peering and you know</font>

292
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:43,410
connecting IP transit customers it's

293
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,329
getting a lot into dollar in dollar out

294
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,600
so business intelligence really people

295
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:50,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to have a much better view of where</font>

296
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:55,350
these traffic is coming from and getting

297
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:57,860
too so I see I i divided this area<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

298
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,000
I see a very popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> in treat</font>

299
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:03,300
subcategories so like a customer

300
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,070
profitability so it's like it can be

301
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,229
seen under a number of lights and so

302
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:09,949
let's say let's take the typical IP

303
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:13,290
transit customer so wholesale customer I

304
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:16,680
seeing a rising interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to seeing</font>

305
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:19,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay this guy is paying me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now half a</font>

306
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,540
dollar per mag let's say am I making a

307
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:24,089
profit on that so let's try to see

308
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:27,510
whether how much of my transit or how

309
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:29,880
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my peering this customer is no</font>

310
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,860
consuming so how much I'm paying<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

311
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,290
this and also how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the backbone</font>

312
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:37,170
how much I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> traveling discuss</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this the</font>

313
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:40,560
traffic for this customer and I address

314
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:43,079
the OTT egg so over-the-top<font color="#E5E5E5"> cassius</font>

315
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,560
behavior right so there is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

316
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:49,349
placing caches from the OTT in the

317
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,569
backbone and somebody does it to

318
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,610
genuinely because of the quality of

319
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:56,310
service and some others just smell a

320
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:59,070
deal so I get some traffic for free

321
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:02,310
let's say or not taking a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

322
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:04,740
resources and then I can make a profit

323
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:07,198
out of it and things like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

324
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,500
say what can happen is that at some

325
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,600
stage then yeah the deal is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal</font>

326
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,970
anymore because of course the OTT can

327
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,770
also approached the downstream customers

328
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,920
and things like that which is nessa

329
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:22,560
not necessarily an issue but at least

330
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:25,589
the people I see they really like to be

331
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,690
aware about what's going on and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

332
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:30,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">third thing is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peer in traffic</font>

333
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:35,820
distance or bit mild calculations so

334
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:39,210
what I see is an emerging trend that is

335
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:41,310
going most likely under the hood because

336
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:45,090
I didn't see much presentations yet

337
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:47,040
about hitting you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know conferences or</font>

338
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:50,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">peer inform and things like that about</font>

339
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fact that the you know ratios are</font>

340
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:58,470
measuring a little bit less or but there

341
00:17:54,810 --> 00:18:00,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">is much more interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> volume</font>

342
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,420
of traffic exchange it but also how deep

343
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:06,270
this traffic is being<font color="#CCCCCC"> traveled into my</font>

344
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,490
backbone so how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

345
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,650
much champagne in terms of backbone to

346
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,960
deliver the traffic from for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

347
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:15,750
content provider and things like that

348
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,130
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we have the second area which</font>

349
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:22,610
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> sdn which is of course traffic</font>

350
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,410
accounting it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely the only</font>

351
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:27,360
emo element of the equation but it's an

352
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:32,090
essential element of the equation by

353
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:35,129
which by having traffic statistics then

354
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:38,389
coupling with the much other information

355
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:41,520
from the network then you can get really

356
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:46,230
you know a picture enough information to

357
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,510
do some educated routing decisions so

358
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,220
once again capacity<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah capacity</font>

359
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:53,760
planning traffic engineering it comes

360
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:56,120
back once a day and finally I see more

361
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">and more you know mobile operators</font>

362
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming also you know no speaking about</font>

363
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,710
traffic accounting IP traffic accounting

364
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,990
flows and things like that which is

365
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I couldn't recognize you</font>

366
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:11,430
know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past of course this is</font>

367
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:14,300
because their infrastructures are

368
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:17,220
getting more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more into the IP space</font>

369
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,860
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more connected</font>

370
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,680
through IP elements but and this is very

371
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,870
nice that Alyssa's was saying before

372
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,840
about the correlation this is a very

373
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">good example of correlation because the</font>

374
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,260
people in the mobile

375
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:35,720
space they do not really speak about mac

376
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,279
addresses or about IP addresses and

377
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like that they speak about</font>

378
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:42,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">context</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they speak about mobile phone</font>

379
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:46,549
numbers and things like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

380
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:53,450
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice example of really a whole</font>

381
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:56,269
world which it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's</font>

382
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:59,960
the data part it's very tightly

383
00:19:56,269 --> 00:20:03,230
controlled by the control plane so by

384
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,059
establishing associations with you with

385
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:08,659
the devices and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

386
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:12,500
should keeping constantly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of</font>

387
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:14,510
information handing and and updated

388
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,450
because otherwise you know you get

389
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:20,990
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> useless out of it so that's</font>

390
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:23,480
another you know thing which is emerging

391
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:27,289
for traffic accounting so doing a lot of

392
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:30,200
gtp inspection and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

393
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:32,899
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share with you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what are my</font>

394
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:35,179
opinion are from my viewpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

395
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:38,629
current and<font color="#E5E5E5"> emerging trends and I leave</font>

396
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:41,860
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the people that do the real stuff</font>

397
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,860
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand</font>

398
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:57,679
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paolo so I'm really excited</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

399
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:59,320
tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys all about what we've been</font>

400
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,469
doing it limelight with accounting

401
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:08,928
especially with Apollo's open sores p.m.

402
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:12,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">account software so Appy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> McCown is a</font>

403
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:16,309
basically open source c program that can

404
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:18,769
accept any kind of net flow as flow IP

405
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:21,769
fix it even<font color="#E5E5E5"> has probes that you can</font>

406
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:23,799
install<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to you know set up a</font>

407
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:26,659
tap kind of a situation and be able to

408
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:28,429
input those flows into p.m. account and

409
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:31,129
then configure p.m. account to basically

410
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:35,079
take a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that multi-dimensional</font>

411
00:21:31,129 --> 00:21:38,449
data that's coming in and aggregate and

412
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:40,519
basically collect this information in

413
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:42,169
multiple different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's all</font>

414
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:44,719
kinds of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming in with the flows</font>

415
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:46,489
but there's all kinds of views that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

416
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:48,950
want to have that's specific to those

417
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:52,700
flows and<font color="#E5E5E5"> pima countess is what we've</font>

418
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:56,269
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using over the past couple years to</font>

419
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:58,429
to pull this information out the thing

420
00:21:56,269 --> 00:22:01,159
that became or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess when p.m. account</font>

421
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:04,579
became viable for us it was when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paolo</font>

422
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:07,549
is able to incorporate<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP data into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

423
00:22:04,579 --> 00:22:09,200
flow data to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to extract the</font>

424
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:10,969
vital information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we needed to be</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">able to do traffic engineering on the</font>

426
00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:18,049
network which is I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know prefix</font>

427
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:20,419
lengths and I need to know ASAS was only

428
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:22,249
available at the time with with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

429
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:26,269
implementation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paolo is able to put</font>

430
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:28,249
into the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> and from that the</font>

431
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:30,820
evolution from there was that eventually

432
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:33,169
we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to use the BGP</font>

433
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,718
feed from each router and we were able

434
00:22:33,169 --> 00:22:37,789
to get that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information directly out of</font>

435
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:40,219
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow information with the extended</font>

436
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,419
data sets that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> available so the</font>

437
00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:44,169
other thing that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really neat was a</font>

438
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:46,719
PM account has a very extensible<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug-in</font>

439
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:49,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">backend architecture to allow us to</font>

440
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:52,399
store this data in a in a back-end

441
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:57,408
database which allows and facilitates

442
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:59,089
for you know some interesting so you

443
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:02,389
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically queries that we could do</font>

444
00:22:59,089 --> 00:23:02,730
on data that they were very exacting we

445
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:04,290
could go

446
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,150
and just slice out exactly what we

447
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:08,070
needed to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at based on the router</font>

448
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,660
that if index on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the interface they were</font>

449
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:13,168
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at or you know from the network</font>

450
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:15,390
as a whole and again in all different

451
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:19,410
dimensions of data both temporal

452
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:22,470
dimensions by five<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes by by days by</font>

453
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:24,990
weeks by years by months and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

454
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:27,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">by the different types</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of data in there</font>

455
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:29,760
so we wouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to instantly</font>

456
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,679
store all information from every flow

457
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,679
sample they came in in one place because

458
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,980
the whole cardinality with the potential

459
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,990
numbers of permutations of aggregations

460
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,059
it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be completely</font>

461
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,770
blowing up any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of system that we</font>

462
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:48,210
were able to put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually</font>

463
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:50,400
store that so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some basic</font>

464
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:53,370
collector architecture overview of what

465
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,490
we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put together with the</font>

466
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:58,168
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> polo's root has written</font>

467
00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:01,500
the the neat thing that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have here is</font>

468
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:03,600
that we can replicate an<font color="#E5E5E5"> S flow or any</font>

469
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of flow information really to</font>

470
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,178
multiple different sockets on the same

471
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,580
server and we do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few reasons</font>

472
00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:13,919
one is just while we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for three</font>

473
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,540
different things basically so we take an

474
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,160
incoming flow and there's a PM account

475
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,918
process that runs and listens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

476
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,710
flow or they listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> incoming</font>

477
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,040
flows from the routers directly then it

478
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:27,419
replicates that<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow out to three other</font>

479
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,700
p.m. account processes that are also

480
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:32,280
running on the same server so we've got

481
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,380
one basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's listening with</font>

482
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,950
snort so we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of</font>

483
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:39,570
intrusion detection on you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

484
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:42,630
flow data that's coming in so if there's

485
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:44,700
a syn floods or UDP floods or that kind

486
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:48,150
of thing we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and set snort</font>

487
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,980
alarms on each of our collectors that

488
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,650
are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to alert us for any kind of</font>

489
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:57,120
security type banks the next thing we

490
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:59,520
pipe the s below to is another<font color="#CCCCCC"> sflow</font>

491
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,719
tool process that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting there s</font>

492
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,410
flow to<font color="#E5E5E5"> letter know if you're familiar</font>

493
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,570
has a command switch to basically be

494
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:09,450
able to dump the raw headers that are

495
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:12,270
coming in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the flow samples as TCP</font>

496
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:14,280
dump format packets and then I'm able to

497
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:15,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">write those two discs on periodic</font>

498
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,420
intervals and

499
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:21,240
save<font color="#CCCCCC"> that information so that i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

500
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:24,750
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look for like a forensic kind</font>

501
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,730
of a thing later on and be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just</font>

502
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:29,130
use TCP dump<font color="#CCCCCC"> a common tool to be able to</font>

503
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:31,650
look at any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information that's</font>

504
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:34,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">in that sampled header that's in the</font>

505
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:35,880
flow sample so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's only two</font>

506
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:37,800
or three hundred bytes of header

507
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,900
information that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get in each</font>

508
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,270
packet sample but that's enough to get

509
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:44,670
the basic information that's a lot

510
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:47,280
allows us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of secure our network</font>

511
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:49,860
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the main flow</font>

512
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,530
aggregation the PM account recon box

513
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:55,169
there and that's using my sequel as a

514
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">back-end storage mechanism so each of</font>

515
00:25:55,170 --> 00:26:00,450
the collectors that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we build has a my</font>

516
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:02,010
sequel memory storage table we ended up

517
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">using memory storage because of the</font>

518
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,430
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flow information that was</font>

519
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,530
coming in on it on any given collector

520
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:09,630
and just the commodity hardware that uh

521
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:11,340
we had at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time be able to throw this</font>

522
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,010
project didn't really have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the disk i/o</font>

523
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:17,760
capabilities to be able to take all that

524
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:19,710
raw aggregated data and save it without

525
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,930
the server following on its face so we

526
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,880
ended up<font color="#CCCCCC"> just specking servers that</font>

527
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:26,070
didn't necessarily have a lot of disk

528
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,650
i/o speed but it did have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decent</font>

529
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:31,110
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of onboard memory so I think</font>

530
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:33,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the 12 or 16 gigabytes in</font>

531
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:35,909
each of the collectors right now and

532
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,250
then basically the disk storage is just

533
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:40,800
for saving those TCP dump flows so all

534
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:43,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">that TCP dump data from one of the</font>

535
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,080
plugins is going straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> to disk and we</font>

536
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,970
can go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if snort alerts us for</font>

537
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,770
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of attack we can go and look</font>

538
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:51,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that TCP dump data for the time</font>

539
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:53,310
period that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nord alerted us and be</font>

540
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,200
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine you know what the</font>

541
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">nature of the attack was if there's any</font>

542
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,470
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of signature that we could identify</font>

543
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,110
is there any way that we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

544
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:05,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that information and use that to</font>

545
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:07,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">build filters on our network etc so the</font>

546
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:09,110
multiple collector architecture is kind

547
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,460
of like this we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got all the routers</font>

548
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,679
you know individually send to one

549
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,510
collector or another and we have a pool

550
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:19,710
of collectors<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all essentially have</font>

551
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:22,470
a script that<font color="#E5E5E5"> runs and looks for certain</font>

552
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:24,210
interfaces now part of the problem is we

553
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,860
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> s flow enabled on all of our</font>

554
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,410
interfaces on the entire network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

555
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,370
it's just a duty a way that s flow works

556
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,250
the IMP

557
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:34,110
interface basically is the one that

558
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,880
looks at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the package sample and we were</font>

559
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,919
mostly interested in looking at our

560
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,900
egress since we're CDN<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we just</font>

561
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">pushed bits out to the to the world all</font>

562
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:45,180
day so that was the the main direction

563
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:49,080
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to focus on so what we</font>

564
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:50,790
have is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a mapping script that</font>

565
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,850
looks at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data and the collectors and</font>

566
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:56,129
then just pulls out information based on

567
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:57,570
router ID and if index that just says

568
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,850
say these are interfaces that I'm

569
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,950
interested in based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the port label on</font>

570
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:05,189
the interface so that all basically

571
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:07,320
dumps back into a single large my sequel

572
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:11,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">back-end database and then from there</font>

573
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:14,610
we're able to write custom scripts on

574
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,110
cacti to look you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know not a script</font>

575
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,729
necessarily but just a command to go and

576
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,500
pull data out of the database for a

577
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:21,630
single point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data and populate in our</font>

578
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,670
our d file for certain things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show</font>

579
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,860
you those in a second we have another

580
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:27,929
tool that were that we've developed

581
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">internally called recon it's a</font>

582
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:31,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">command-line interface it allows us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

583
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:34,199
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to look at this type of stuff</font>

584
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:36,840
you know previously we're using an

585
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,820
appliance and it's all gui-based and it

586
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,530
takes a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to navigate through</font>

587
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,090
with mouse and click and router and

588
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:43,920
interface and find all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff so</font>

589
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:46,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handy to be able to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

590
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,240
CLI to lure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was you I guess the</font>

591
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,250
goal at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginning was to have a CLI</font>

592
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,650
tool to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say hey I'm on this</font>

593
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:54,360
router I'm affecting changes right now I

594
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:57,030
got this other window I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just run a</font>

595
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,070
command and tell me exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what each</font>

596
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,690
interface on each router is doing as far

597
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:05,250
as prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> Orias paths or whatever</font>

598
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:08,160
whatever so yeah here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> neat data</font>

599
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:10,590
ipv6 information there's no real other

600
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,770
way to get ipv6 traffic levels without

601
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:17,370
looking at flow information so it's a

602
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:20,309
really cool side effect of having a flow

603
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:23,729
analysis tool so now our backbone

604
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:26,700
interfaces typically we're sending

605
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:28,530
traffic from cache nodes or origin nodes

606
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,600
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> cash nodes it's all internal traffic</font>

607
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:31,649
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> your typical carrier traffic</font>

608
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,020
where we're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a lot of</font>

609
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:37,230
customer traffic that's basically not at

610
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:39,570
our control but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there were certain</font>

611
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:42,300
instances where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were egressing</font>

612
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,110
traffic out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a city that was not the</font>

613
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">city that was</font>

614
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:47,340
generating that traffic and there's

615
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,290
really no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to kind of break down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

616
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:52,919
the traffic was on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our network other</font>

617
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:55,020
than it was full so this has<font color="#E5E5E5"> given us</font>

618
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:57,980
the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ability to visualize that in</font>

619
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:01,080
any different way another thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

620
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:03,600
visual<font color="#E5E5E5"> line traffic that was going to a</font>

621
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,299
provider maybe we did some<font color="#CCCCCC"> te we didn't</font>

622
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,250
have capacity over a peering link and so

623
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:09,629
we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move traffic to transit it</font>

624
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">really gave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us the opportunity or</font>

625
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:14,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability to look in the database and do</font>

626
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:18,510
an easy query that would say show me all

627
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:20,549
traffic that is going to XYZ asn but

628
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:23,429
where that<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn is not the first hop in</font>

629
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:25,110
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aaas path which is indicating to us</font>

630
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:30,840
that that traffic is going over some

631
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:32,428
other suboptimal costly link and then

632
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,629
yeah so command line utilities being

633
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:36,000
able to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I talked about</font>

634
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:41,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the snort and the TCP dump information</font>

635
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,340
already so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an example of some</font>

636
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,309
SNMP data at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top of a one of our</font>

637
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">backbone interfaces and then a breakdown</font>

638
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:52,970
of what the traffic looks like when it's

639
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:54,750
grouped into four different general

640
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,990
categories that we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up</font>

641
00:30:54,750 --> 00:31:00,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">with so the the green at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom is</font>

642
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:02,640
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internal traffic where</font>

643
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:05,160
the source and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the destination IP</font>

644
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,770
address or prefix are prefixes that are

645
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,210
in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp and so we use that</font>

646
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:11,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make the assumption that</font>

647
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:13,890
that's all traffic coming from our

648
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,200
servers or systems and going to other

649
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers and systems on our network but</font>

650
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we were able to kind of break that</font>

651
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:21,710
down even further and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well what</font>

652
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:24,809
about traffic that's coming from

653
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:27,270
limelight<font color="#CCCCCC"> managed devices but going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

654
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:29,250
non<font color="#CCCCCC"> limelight managed devices and so</font>

655
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:31,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the next line and then the</font>

656
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:34,559
opposite inverse of that is traffic

657
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:37,230
that's coming from non limelight devices

658
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:40,080
going to limelight managed devices or

659
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:43,260
networks and then the last thing is just

660
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic that is not from limelight or to</font>

661
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,580
limelight and it's you know typically

662
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,860
customer traffic that you know it's a

663
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,080
customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet and</font>

664
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:54,780
basically we be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that so</font>

665
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,159
before p.m. account and this whole

666
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,940
system that we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop we</font>

667
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,190
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just see the</font>

668
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,470
the graph on the top it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's</font>

669
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe full but what do we what are we</font>

670
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:04,770
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find there well in the bottom</font>

671
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,159
graph you can see all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yellow</font>

672
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:09,600
traffic is traffic that's going from

673
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:13,350
limelight networks to somewhere off the

674
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,149
network and I don't I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily</font>

675
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:18,209
want to see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that link there so I</font>

676
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:19,770
be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go in and do a recon command</font>

677
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:21,780
on this backbone interface and be able

678
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:25,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see the exact prefixes and the exact</font>

679
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:30,780
AAS pass that we needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move or try</font>

680
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:33,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and change so that's one neat data point</font>

681
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:36,270
that we've got now the next thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

682
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:37,950
just v6 data this data<font color="#CCCCCC"> was unavailable</font>

683
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:41,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">to us prior to being able to implement</font>

684
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:44,820
p.m. account and have the specific

685
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:46,860
filtering as far as flows that come in

686
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">and saying okay drop all flow data</font>

687
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:51,179
that's v4 only say flow data that's v6

688
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,190
say that in a database table dump that

689
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:56,040
into the main database and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we have</font>

690
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:57,780
just some homegrown graphing software to

691
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,090
kind of pull that out you can see right

692
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:02,149
here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> June</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're ipv6 day kicked in</font>

693
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:06,480
and there's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first inflection point</font>

694
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:08,700
go ipv6 and then August or so is when we

695
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,040
started actually ramping customers

696
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,960
existing customers and enabling v6 for

697
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:17,310
those guys and ramping those guys into

698
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:21,890
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the v6 land so v6 is awesome and</font>

699
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:21,889
here's a recon this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a basic</font>

700
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:26,430
command line utility that we've

701
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">developed that allows us to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at any</font>

702
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:32,880
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data points so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can say</font>

703
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:35,250
recon<font color="#E5E5E5"> dash ellos for location we can</font>

704
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,650
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide a pop name we can provide</font>

705
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:40,590
a specific interface we could provide a

706
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:42,570
specific router name we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for</font>

707
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:44,280
prefixes we can look for a s<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths we</font>

708
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:46,800
can look for destination a s we can look

709
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,870
for source and destination networks on

710
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:51,690
different interfaces depending on if its

711
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:53,520
backbone interface between two cities or

712
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:58,470
if it's an egress interface that's going

713
00:33:53,520 --> 00:34:00,570
out to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah the future</font>

714
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:02,160
so right now we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> my sequel as</font>

715
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:05,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's kind of limited as</font>

719
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,389
ton of data

720
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,240
and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be locked to like a</font>

721
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:16,610
single CPU and however many disks are

722
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,989
behind that server so part of the

723
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,630
direction that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to go right</font>

00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:22,750
now is with the notes equal solution

726
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:27,889
inserts and selects to be able to

727
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:32,300
improve the performance of everything

728
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:33,740
and eventually have the I guess SLA on

729
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,110
our own internal tool that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would allow</font>

730
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:38,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">us to kind of start pulling that</font>

731
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:42,800
information into some traffic automation

732
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:56,830
platforms and that kind of thing thank

733
00:34:42,800 --> 00:35:00,590
you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you we at m6 we have it easy</font>

734
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:05,120
we do not do anything basically in terms

735
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:09,460
of pricing based on traffic so all our

736
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:14,359
traffic accounting is more or less

737
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:16,550
accurate but we are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really concerned</font>

738
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,830
if it's really really accurate because

741
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,890
we do a quick traffic accounting or

00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,360
mostly for our services for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our members</font>

743
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:31,400
they just want to see how much traffic

00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,290
they do on the internet exchange and we

745
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,990
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see that too and we would</font>

00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:56,690
predict what do you think the future

<font color="#E5E5E5">will be you use it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to extrapolate the</font>

754

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> upgrade our switches when do we need</font>

757
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:11,350
for troubleshooting so what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

758
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:13,610
or we have SNMP counters and we count

759
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:15,710
bits frames and errors that the

760
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:18,580
interface counters that fe interface has

761
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:20,640
and we put it<font color="#CCCCCC"> all down in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our ID</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too and</font>

762
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:24,869
we use

763
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,480
adapted version of mr TD for that we

764
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:30,079
have web portal where our customers can

765
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,519
can log into an agency around graphs

766
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,730
what I particularly like about it is

767
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:37,410
that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an optional option to</font>

768
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:39,779
shell graphs little not sure if McWhite

00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:41,460
access which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly and the</font>

770
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:43,589
four errors and that's why i put this

771
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,990
graph on when you see you like a big

772
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:48,690

very small peak on for you to right hand

774

counters from all these customers

781
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:19,289

786
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:38,730
in there we only store and look at the

source and destination MAC addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

the easy type that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only thing that</font>

789
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:48,240
is of interest for us all the other the

790
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:50,309
data the whole samples and that are in

791
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,808
the data grams are not of interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

792
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:54,869
us because we don't think it's our

793
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:57,210
traffic we are in internet club in the

794
00:37:54,869 --> 00:37:59,849
end we switched Ethernet frames that's

795
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:05,579
what we do and so we look only at eating

796
00:37:59,849 --> 00:38:09,720
it ethernet poverty of things and again

797
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:12,089
this is all put down into<font color="#CCCCCC"> our d2 and we</font>

798
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,730
have reports all that is available for

799
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:17,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">our customers where they can see the</font>

800
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:21,420
traffic / Pierre how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that we</font>

801
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:23,670
collect the<font color="#CCCCCC"> data grams we that is</font>

802
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:26,640
collected on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ingress interface of</font>

803
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:29,130
the switch and then we'll figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out</font>

804
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,319
like hey that has destination MAC

805
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:34,010
address

806
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,860
of that beer so we'll put it as output

807
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:40,730
traffic on on the portal for deaf beer

808
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:43,850
so it is a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of me mixing and</font>

809
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:47,480
matching behind that to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

810
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:51,790
graphs and then we presented in a way I

811
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:55,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually very say a top ten of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

812
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:56,930
the PSA you most volume with and with

813
00:38:55,070 --> 00:39:00,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that our customers can actually do some</font>

814
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:03,230
traffic engineering and making<font color="#CCCCCC"> decisions</font>

815
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:05,299
on it and see if they can do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

816
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:07,490
traffic data certain pier and Monta

818
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:11,720
certainly see that as a peer that don't

819
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:13,640
appear at all weights and this they sent

820
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,589
a little traffic to them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> right at</font>

00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">that conform oh yeah we do something</font>

00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:28,250
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very useful to next to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else there's more active</font>

monitoring a little bit of previous Emma

827
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:37,700
was talking about we actively<font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font>

828
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:40,390
frames with timing information around on

829
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:45,230
the platform where we measure delay

830
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:49,129
jitter and famous with and we call this

2a not start an IV to we use something

836
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,290
like nine companies in leaf and they

837
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:11,900
have this nice html5 or flesh graphs

838
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:14,480
that changed every five seconds so it's

839
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:19,910
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see there's our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

840
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:25,420
really cool to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see for our own</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">troubleshooting or our own network</font>

842
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:31,040
management we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some scripts</font>

843
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,080
that basically sent those emails send

844
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,320
emails about eight this particular port

845
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,910
shows error so it a script that

846
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:39,650
periodically goes through<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these rd</font>

847
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:41,029
files and checks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ida is an error</font>

848
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:42,730
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this narrow and this port in</font>

849
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:47,690
reports is all in a daily

850
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:50,210
and it also shows like almost over

851
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:52,010
utilized links so we can go to our

852
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:54,830
customers or our members and say like

853
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:56,720
hey you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that your portage who you</font>

854
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:58,520
might want to think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an upgrade</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

855
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,060
might want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of looking at the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">S load to that he just so to see what</font>

857
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,330
height perhaps you can do some traffic

858
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:09,339
engineering to get some traffic away

859
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:14,750
because yeah you heard your port is full

860
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:19,090
so we also have for ourselves a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

861
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:22,100
correlation tool which takes to the

862
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:24,530
historical data basically that that the

863
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:27,140
data from from the day before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

864
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:29,840
compares it with a certain time period

865
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:33,080
you select and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

866
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:35,270
find some anomalies and if you look at

867
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:39,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic graph form from yesterday</font>

868
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:42,290
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a wee uptake in in the</font>

869
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:44,899
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with this tool I could find</font>

870
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:46,670
and you have to believe me the graph

871
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,250
below is from a customer boards that

872
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:56,080
just send suddenly much more traffic to

873
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:58,760
our platform but our issues we have well

874
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,819
we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a neat database like a</font>

875
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:04,970
limelight<font color="#CCCCCC"> has first it's a huge number</font>

876
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,470
of rd fouls it severely<font color="#CCCCCC"> youth so</font>

877
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:08,870
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a file system database</font>

878
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:11,359
and we have all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of scripts that</font>

879
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:13,609
blow through all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> already files</font>

880
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,310
open them expected data out of the

881
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:17,900
closed and taking next file go on and on

882
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:19,850
and on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> digging through all these</font>

883
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:23,600
files makes the system really really

884
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:27,290
slow and also we have to have a pretty

885
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:29,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">fast file system file system needed to</font>

886
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:33,320
update all these five all these files

887
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:36,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">every five seconds this is this is slow</font>

888
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:39,140
and in the end is not really scalable so

889
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:42,800
but what would you like and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

890
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:45,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you would like perhaps this</font>

891
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,390
SNMP<font color="#CCCCCC"> pulling mechanism</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not scalable</font>

892
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:49,520
in the end they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to see what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

893
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:52,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">do with a slow counters</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SLO datagrams</font>

894
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,680
also contain counter informations the

895
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:59,630
same data as you pull out it as

896
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:01,490
p but it's being pushed towards towards

897
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:07,250
the collection systems and you can

898
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:08,209
paralyze that much better<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

899
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:12,650
it must be something like a

900
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:15,320
multi-dimensional rd like system right

901
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:18,800
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> there we we correlate lots and lots</font>

902
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rd files and would be much nicer if</font>

903
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can have some kind of data structure</font>

904
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,770
of database type thing where you can

905
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:28,009
make these correlations and do fast

906
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:31,970
queries in it is amazing if it's one

907
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:33,860
database it must be scalable because in

908
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:36,680
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't thing to do and I think</font>

909
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:38,300
limelight already does that you do the

910
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,810
on one system you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have multiple</font>

911
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:46,940
systems so some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of multi house</font>

912
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:48,770
system is probably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future so this is</font>

913
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:55,760
what well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think and i guess we can</font>

914
00:43:48,770 --> 00:44:00,860
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion now right thank you</font>

915
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:02,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys that was very informative so let me</font>

916
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,750
summarize up a little bit what we talked

917
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:08,240
about as Paul mentioned none of this is

918
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:11,630
rocket science but we still seem to be

919
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:14,680
behind on the possibilities that that we

920
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:18,400
have and the the possibility of

921
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:22,069
correlation of various inputs various

922
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,890
data models that we get out of parts of

923
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:26,990
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> network seems to be something very</font>

924
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:32,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting that should be followed up</font>

925
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:34,819
on and get more in depth on that and the

926
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:36,830
repeated mention and this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

927
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:38,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">just realized actually that every single</font>

928
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:40,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">one of you was talking about the back</font>

929
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:44,860
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the scalability of the back end</font>

930
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:47,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the issues that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have with that so</font>

931
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:50,750
how are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna and let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just move</font>

932
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:52,870
into questions out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that so one thing</font>

933
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:56,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about is how</font>

934
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:58,609
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys see the database back and</font>

935
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:03,530
situation behind something like flow

936
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:05,330
collection or other metrics how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

937
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:08,059
going to evolve and how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we going to</font>

938
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:11,180
make it more scalable than the current

939
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:13,880
illusions that are used I know that

940
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:17,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">Paulo has been playing a little bit and</font>

941
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:20,439
investigating different database models

942
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:26,749
dig right into it tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> all about it</font>

943
00:45:20,439 --> 00:45:31,209
yeah so I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been experimenting let's</font>

944
00:45:26,749 --> 00:45:37,129
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Moyes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ql databases and</font>

945
00:45:31,209 --> 00:45:40,578
at the moment I've I've done kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

946
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:43,579
selection because no SQL world it seems

947
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:46,069
to be an<font color="#E5E5E5"> endless world right so there is</font>

948
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:47,650
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of things it's clearly where you</font>

949
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:50,630
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there is a lack of</font>

950
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:52,609
standardization so you can say a lot of

951
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:55,509
things against the relational databases

952
00:45:52,609 --> 00:45:58,699
but then you have a standardized way to

953
00:45:55,509 --> 00:46:01,099
put the data into the database and get

954
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:04,359
it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's something that some</font>

955
00:46:01,099 --> 00:46:11,029
sort of standardized interface the

956
00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:13,729
muscular old NoSQL or i would say 99% of

957
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:15,949
them it's not it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> lacking at the moment</font>

958
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:18,979
so it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit a painful</font>

959
00:46:15,949 --> 00:46:24,289
process and i ended up experimenting a

960
00:46:18,979 --> 00:46:28,609
bit with the MongoDB myself where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got</font>

961
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:33,079
some cases comparable results to SQL in

962
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:34,459
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases and outperforming and one of</font>

963
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:37,939
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i did--like i mean</font>

964
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:40,788
traffic accounting I mean your traffic

965
00:46:37,939 --> 00:46:43,399
accounting out of flow data it's a lot

966
00:46:40,789 --> 00:46:45,589
about aggregation so one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

967
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:51,390
did really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like of recent MongoDB is</font>

968
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:53,609
that the native sort of implementation

969
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:56,250
if you can say a native implementation

970
00:46:53,609 --> 00:47:00,269
of MapReduce or actually you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get rid</font>

971
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:03,269
of MapReduce in favor of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> native way of</font>

972
00:47:00,269 --> 00:47:05,939
aggregating data and which is pretty

973
00:47:03,269 --> 00:47:07,729
interesting for NoSQL solutions so

974
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,930
that's why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it was very</font>

975
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:14,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting and fitting the problem</font>

976
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:17,700
statement let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right thanks I</font>

977
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:25,410
believe we mentioned Cassandra before as

978
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:28,109
well yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cassandra is just another</font>

979
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:30,299
no sequel database I think Facebook uses

980
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:33,058
it for most of their stuff and we've

981
00:47:30,299 --> 00:47:36,059
looked at using it internally and other

982
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:37,700
groups but that other group<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

983
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:41,430
networking haven't really got together

984
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:44,848
yet as much as we could to develop that

985
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:46,680
any further so the thing about Cassandra

986
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:48,990
is that it's all java-based and a lot of

987
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:51,529
the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was doing is all based</font>

988
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:54,589
in C and what I was saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

989
00:47:51,529 --> 00:47:56,549
optimizations of the MapReduce

990
00:47:54,589 --> 00:48:00,930
functionality I guess that we would need

991
00:47:56,549 --> 00:48:02,460
on top of really yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's and the non</font>

992
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:04,769
standardization of all these different

993
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:07,319
no sequel products is really confusing

994
00:48:04,769 --> 00:48:08,788
so so we could have a Cassandra database

995
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:10,650
they would be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to store and retrieve</font>

996
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:12,960
information but then if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do</font>

997
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:14,670
analytics on data then there you know

998
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,769
we'd have to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like with like</font>

999
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:18,420
a Hadoop cluster and be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write</font>

1000
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:20,299
those MapReduce jobs that he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

1001
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,890
about and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> part that has that</font>

1002
00:48:20,299 --> 00:48:25,339
abstracted java-based kind of thing and

1003
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:28,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">it it adds a little bit of computational</font>

1004
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:30,960
stuff to the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it so at this point</font>

1005
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:33,269
I'm I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what palos put</font>

1006
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:38,039
together with the mongo DB and the

1007
00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:41,459
streamline<font color="#E5E5E5"> this of it I like that so all</font>

1008
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:43,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question on databases for</font>

1009
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:46,950
Orion so are you guys planning on moving

1010
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:49,849
away from the rd files flat files on the

1011
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:52,529
service you guys have into something

1012
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:57,240
more database like you mentioned it but

1013
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:59,609
any investigations on that yeah but at

1014
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:01,740
the moment it's more talking like we

1015
00:48:59,609 --> 00:49:02,910
should do this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not going to</font>

1016
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:06,660
scale

1017
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:10,020
future but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are more important</font>

1018
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:12,058
things to do for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1019
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:16,160
aware of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem and I guess we'll</font>

1020
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:16,160
be ready just in time with something new

1021
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:32,038
so no<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um so something else</font>

1022
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:38,190
correlation and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna start with</font>

1023
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:40,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">Paolo again so sao paulo you buildin the</font>

1024
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:45,150
functionality into p.m. acct to

1025
00:49:40,589 --> 00:49:48,589
correlate data with<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP bgp and get all</font>

1026
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:52,799
kinds of additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> information out of</font>

1027
00:49:48,589 --> 00:49:57,270
not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flow samples what else do</font>

1028
00:49:52,799 --> 00:50:00,509
you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could be correlated into a</font>

1029
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:05,180
system like that and useful to have in

1030
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:11,190
your flow information in the future yeah

1031
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:15,058
let's say I can definitely see that you

1032
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:16,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP igp it's something of very</font>

1033
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:19,859
much use<font color="#CCCCCC"> force all that has been very</font>

1034
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:23,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful for service providers and i think</font>

1035
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:25,770
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> correlation I think you made</font>

1036
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:27,779
the stress once again a very important

1037
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:30,390
point is with correlate a correlating

1038
00:50:27,779 --> 00:50:34,799
multiple informations together right so

1039
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:37,230
at some stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I guess that moving into</font>

1040
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:40,559
different let's say segments so from the

1041
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:42,450
service provider so courier IP transit

1042
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,329
and things like that there is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1043
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:47,759
can be done when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get closer let's</font>

1044
00:50:45,329 --> 00:50:50,640
say to the end users for example so i

1045
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,799
was doing one example with the mobile

1046
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:56,640
providers that are getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP so of</font>

1047
00:50:52,799 --> 00:51:00,210
course correlation of a flow data again

1048
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:03,569
all traffic data against GTP for example

1049
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:06,210
and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course you would be the</font>

1050
00:51:03,569 --> 00:51:09,119
equivalent for the residential business

1051
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:10,910
edge<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would say would be correlation</font>

1052
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:15,109
against dhcp or

1053
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:16,910
against radius or wherever you you know

1054
00:51:15,109 --> 00:51:18,950
the IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the mac address</font>

1055
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:21,259
doesn't mean anything anymore so you

1056
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:25,700
have other ways or other means to

1057
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:27,829
identify a user and identify you<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you</font>

1058
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,480
know what the user is doing so

1059
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:33,200
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's those are the areas</font>

1060
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:36,559
that I see I'm in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dream I mean that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1061
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:38,899
see coming how about I'm dreaming ey

1062
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,789
here but how about like what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> en was</font>

1063
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:44,240
talking about with the system they have

1064
00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:46,640
set up for for jitter and delay and to

1065
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:48,799
have that someone somehow encapsulated

1066
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">in your flow data across your backbone</font>

1067
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:53,119
or something like that yeah of course of

1068
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:56,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">course of course that's that is</font>

1069
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:59,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">something definitely something very</font>

1070
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:02,030
interesting and one other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing could be</font>

1071
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:04,970
another heart area let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

1072
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:08,900
worth some investigation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say is</font>

1073
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:11,480
also the how to correlate DPI data with

1074
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:13,789
flow data so I with the flow data you

1075
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:18,650
get the big picture of course but then

1076
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:22,220
from dpi or from some shots of DPI you

1077
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:24,470
can see you know at the edge what the

1078
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:25,788
customer is doing customer behavior and

1079
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:30,109
things like that i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there is</font>

1080
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:31,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">some works going on so I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's of</font>

1081
00:52:30,109 --> 00:52:33,799
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> a scalability it's a big issue</font>

1082
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:37,309
over there so that's the power we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1083
00:52:33,799 --> 00:52:42,259
database<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah erin was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nodding over</font>

1084
00:52:37,309 --> 00:52:44,510
there correlate something generally when

1085
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:46,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">I look at the long-term correlation you</font>

1086
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:48,440
know it's really we start to look at the

1087
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:51,319
concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data center is a unit or</font>

1088
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:54,140
power to packet and you know taking

1089
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:56,990
events like humidity temperature power

1090
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:58,670
utilization processor utilization moving

1091
00:52:56,990 --> 00:53:00,618
around virtual machines etc actually

1092
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:03,410
calculating things like the cost of a

1093
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:06,140
total set of units being distributed to

1094
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:08,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">18 area or another</font>

1095
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:10,890
related to whatever metrics the

1096
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:12,630
customers are paying for so I think you

1097
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">know correlation is absolutely essential</font>

1098
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:18,630
and unfortunately we still haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

1099
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:21,868
scratched the surface of tools to really

1100
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:23,700
do large-scale analytics and and and

1101
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:32,100
come up with real answers to big picture

1102
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:33,960
questions like cost all right okay we

1103
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:37,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">still have a couple of minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go how</font>

1104
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:41,220
about some questions from out there I

1105
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:45,230
think we can open<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the mics if anyone</font>

1106
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:45,230
wants to step up

1107
00:53:51,059 --> 00:54:00,099
all right at<font color="#CCCCCC"> home this is a linkedin um</font>

1108
00:53:55,950 --> 00:54:02,589
how have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys looked at grid</font>

1109
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:05,589
computing like Hadoop and does that work

1110
00:54:02,589 --> 00:54:08,799
I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> for scalability stuff like like</font>

1111
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:15,670
analytics last game analytics I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1112
00:54:08,799 --> 00:54:19,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">curious yeah so had you we're using</font>

1113
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:21,430
internally for log file processing from

1114
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:23,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">the edge servers that are delivering</font>

1115
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:25,480
objects so to touch on the point that

1116
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:27,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">ELISA was just making earlier the holy</font>

1117
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,920
grail for us is basically being able to

1118
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:32,140
bridge<font color="#CCCCCC"> the gap between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network and</font>

1119
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application levels logs to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

1120
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:36,279
to correlate that information with the

1121
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:38,170
you know so if i<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an object its</font>

1122
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,760
delivered<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know the exact time that</font>

1123
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:42,069
that object was delivered how big it was

1124
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">and what the destination host was and</font>

1125
00:54:42,069 --> 00:54:47,440
then you know be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to track that back</font>

1126
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:49,390
to basically what interface and router

1127
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">board and how much that you know traffic</font>

1128
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:53,859
ended up costing not going to think so

1129
00:54:51,609 --> 00:54:57,308
the eventual goal is to be able to use

1130
00:54:53,859 --> 00:55:01,000
that I do kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of infrastructure to</font>

1131
00:54:57,309 --> 00:55:03,369
expand into the network data and use

1132
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,349
that to augment the data that we're

1133
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:10,960
currently processing with what the

1134
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:13,450
applications I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my question is a</font>

1135
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like how's it working</font>

1136
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:18,368
out I mean is it is it something that

1137
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:21,069
that in scale you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is good I'm</font>

1138
00:55:18,369 --> 00:55:23,799
kind of doing a little bit of them

1139
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:25,690
myself and seeing like would love to see

1140
00:55:23,799 --> 00:55:27,069
other people do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and get some feedback</font>

1141
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:29,020
on how it's going with the right

1142
00:55:27,069 --> 00:55:30,790
direction or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah the biggest</font>

1143
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:33,329
challenge is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the development cycle</font>

1144
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:35,380
for it but yeah we're absolutely seeing

1145
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:38,859
improvements in performance and<font color="#CCCCCC"> gains</font>

1146
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:40,119
that you know ten times more performance

1147
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:42,450
than we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen trying to</font>

1148
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:45,970
individually process these things

1149
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:48,730
without some kind of the larger hit

1150
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:52,720
MapReduce tight cluster absolutely

1151
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:55,119
thanks actually to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of a</font>

1152
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">question I have done a fair bit of</font>

1153
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,599
playing terrific<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fredi but a quick</font>

1154
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,819
request can people you really learn how

1155
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:02,950
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the mic cuz it's impossible to</font>

1156
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:05,290
hear most of what's being said and maybe

1157
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:08,770
I am the only one here but you know and

1158
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:10,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is everyone able to hear stuff I'm</font>

1159
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:13,990
not able to hear a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what's being</font>

1160
00:56:10,299 --> 00:56:15,819
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to speak closer to the mic</font>

1161
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:17,049
and especially the<font color="#E5E5E5"> speakers you have to</font>

1162
00:56:15,819 --> 00:56:18,250
be really conscious because when you're

1163
00:56:17,049 --> 00:56:20,259
sitting there you can't tell whether

1164
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:22,420
your voice is coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but if you</font>

1165
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:29,760
speak into the mic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> speak loudly</font>

1166
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:33,130
it can be heard can you hear me now<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1167
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:35,369
we involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a project that's been</font>

1168
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:39,579
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> really large scale flow and</font>

1169
00:56:35,369 --> 00:56:42,280
two fellows point or I've we've looked

1170
00:56:39,579 --> 00:56:44,980
at not all but a number of the no sequel

1171
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:46,780
databases some of whom Cassandra you

1172
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:48,280
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of read the documentation and blood</font>

1173
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,799
starts pouring out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your ears as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1174
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,990
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what the data model is</font>

1175
00:56:49,799 --> 00:56:54,910
and a lot of it that that other people

1176
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:58,240
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to get really high insert</font>

1177
00:56:54,910 --> 00:57:00,940
rates for we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't deploying in</font>

1178
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,200
cluster the problem with Hadoop as a

1179
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,200
friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine likes to say is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

1180
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:07,089
stupidity but<font color="#CCCCCC"> its stupidity that scales</font>

1181
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:09,160
it is true that you can solve problems

1182
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:11,440
eventually by<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting enough nodes on</font>

1183
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,940
and touching every byte of data on the

1184
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,920
file system that's got a couple problems

1185
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,660
one of them is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Java that you</font>

1186
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,900
mentioned and for that i would recommend

1187
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:23,049
map r which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hadoop distribution</font>

1188
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:24,910
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> written using c++ underneath we</font>

1189
00:57:23,049 --> 00:57:27,759
put it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our clusters and the</font>

1190
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:29,828
network was the bottleneck<font color="#E5E5E5"> 48 disks /</font>

1191
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,690
and was saturating the 10 gig doing and

1192
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:33,599
we were all clapping in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the corner like</font>

1193
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:36,819
finally something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually scales</font>

1194
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:39,640
the problem on top of that is then the

1195
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:42,369
your option for not writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java and not</font>

1196
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:44,859
touching every file on disk and being

1197
00:57:42,369 --> 00:57:46,450
away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a produces hive or pig which</font>

1198
00:57:44,859 --> 00:57:48,520
then compiled a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java and submit as</font>

1199
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:50,680
MapReduce and are pretty inefficient so

1200
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:52,809
they approach that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> project was</font>

1201
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,368
taking was to write something sort of

1202
00:57:52,809 --> 00:57:56,290
like I've a structured query language

1203
00:57:54,369 --> 00:57:58,299
but then it skips all of the rest of the

1204
00:57:56,290 --> 00:58:00,759
dupe and runs on top of the clustered

1205
00:57:58,299 --> 00:58:03,850
file system you know that is HDFS or

1206
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,340
bar and I think you need something like

1207
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:07,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">that because I do not think that for</font>

1208
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:09,790
dealing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 10 gig that could be</font>

1209
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:11,620
doing a gigabyte per minute of flow in

1210
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:13,000
jest if you're doing let's say in front

1211
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:14,560
of that data center<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something that</font>

1212
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,510
you really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do unsampled and get</font>

1213
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:18,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">performance for I think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1214
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:19,510
most secret will have a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1215
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,490
the trick is how do you write the

1216
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:22,810
efficient layer that only touches the

1217
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:25,990
data you need if you're doing a graph

1218
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:27,430
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last three days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right you don't</font>

1219
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:29,109
want a MapReduce process that's going to

1220
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:32,259
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and touch every bite on the disk and</font>

1221
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:33,670
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the approach that I think I</font>

1222
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,920
think it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something Hadoop like</font>

1223
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:40,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">rather than something big table big you</font>

1224
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:41,650
know big data no sequel like I think it

1225
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:44,080
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hoodoo pika</font>

1226
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:46,690
system but they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1227
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:49,569
efficient and continue to build next

1228
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:52,120
step beyond the clustered file system is

1229
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:53,350
to come and give a query language that

1230
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,200
skips all the rest of it of

1231
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:58,360
infrastructure and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's</font>

1232
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:00,399
that's that's the trend<font color="#CCCCCC"> we sets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1233
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:04,090
direction that this projects gone and

1234
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:11,710
has had some success with some thanks

1235
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:13,230
for sharing yes thanks definitely we

1236
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:15,160
would definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> love to hear more about</font>

1237
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:17,170
different solutions and different

1238
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:21,040
implementations that you guys have out

1239
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:25,450
there so find us in the break we'll be

1240
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:30,340
out there and talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us so let me touch</font>

1241
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:31,960
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one last future thing here we're all</font>

1242
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:34,810
talking about open flow and we're all

1243
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:37,360
talking as the end and how we gonna

1244
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:41,440
influence our routing more by ourselves

1245
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:43,540
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe that traffic accounting</font>

1246
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,630
data correlation is going to be one

1247
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:49,360
input data input into that making

1248
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:50,860
decisions about how we will end up

1249
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:54,130
influencing the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow on a</font>

1250
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:56,980
network I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

1251
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:59,440
theoretical topic so far and there is

1252
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:02,620
not much going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> but have you guys seen</font>

1253
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:05,710
anything around that is going into<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1254
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:07,160
direction and<font color="#E5E5E5"> using data flow data</font>

1255
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:14,210
anything as

1256
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:16,850
as input into systems like that however

1257
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:22,730
it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome but we haven't got</font>

1258
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:27,460
there yet that's the goal yeah that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1259
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:30,980
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same with me yeah lot of</font>

1260
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:33,800
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it prototypes and things</font>

1261
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:36,290
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people really are actively</font>

1262
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:40,040
working on that and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> on different</font>

1263
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:42,620
ideas which is very nice so it's it's

1264
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:44,779
very nice to see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as yang at the end</font>

1265
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:47,569
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> three and bright line people are</font>

1266
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:50,150
doing also different things also within

1267
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:52,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same brand and but yeah not in</font>

1268
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:54,710
concrete yet it's very much research and

1269
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,589
development on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moon let's talk about</font>

1270
01:00:54,710 --> 01:01:04,160
that next time all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> any more</font>

1271
01:00:57,590 --> 01:01:07,070
questions this is it then thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all</font>

1272
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,609

you very much Lisa thanks panelists that

1276
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:37,910
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful resyncing my ear you're on</font>

1277
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:41,630
a little bit now we have a series of

1278
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:48,649
lightning talks coming up I can get less

1279
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:52,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">Peters with new star up here new star in</font>
