1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:06,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wrote an abstract that caused this</font>

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,610
work to happen and so they give me

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,070
credit unlike<font color="#CCCCCC"> the third one down but the</font>

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,660
guys who actually did the work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font>

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,079
pronounce their names but there they are

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,880
and they're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great and the really</font>

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:20,698
<font color="#E5E5E5">neat thing about writing an abstract and</font>

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,460
having some grad students think about

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and try to write some code around what</font>

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">the idea is is that they think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,320
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wouldn't necessarily have</font>

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,119
thought of and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them are kind of</font>

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,170
interesting so I'm pretty excited about

14
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:36,360
that this work came from some work we

15
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,510
did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron I'm on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Advisory Council</font>

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,250
of errands so when the public<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy</font>

17
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,960
meetings happen and there's consensus in

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,570
the community we try to help formalize

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,219
policy changes and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

20
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,940
represents the consensus of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

21
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,370
community so when we started changing

22
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,160
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plush 19 minimum</font>

23
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,870
allocation to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> slash twenty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we started</font>

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,550
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> well gee what happens to the</font>

25
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,989
global routing table and is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

26
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,550
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at it and so I went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

27
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,890
for a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time because I have limited</font>

28
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,960
programming skills and<font color="#CCCCCC"> has limited</font>

29
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,330
amounts of time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> said to people gee</font>

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,339
wouldn't it be great if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew axor</font>

31
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,119
wouldn't it be great if and so people

32
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">like Phillips</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Matthew does the weekly</font>

33
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:19,070
routing table report thing has

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,210
breakdowns by regional registry now and

35
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,279
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those quotes that some of those</font>

36
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,490
things answer some of my questions but

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,430
my main questions were things like how

38
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,979
to actual allocations affect the routing

39
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,360
table so when a registry hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a</font>

40
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,640
block of address space how does that

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,920
affect the table and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more</font>

42
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,390
focused on the routing table while

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,030
looking at address allocations and

44
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,770
assignments as opposed to you know how

45
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,710
much could we aggregate the routing

46
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,810
table based on you know a s path lengths

47
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,389
or whatever that everybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks</font>

48
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,670
about so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has more of a registry focus</font>

49
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,850
and I don't have any idea what my<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

50
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,170
slide is oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so a little overview I</font>

51
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,750
think you guys are all familiar with

52
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,700
most of this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that internet</font>

53
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">registry design address blocks and I</font>

54
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,670
want it I want to take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute to</font>

55
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,199
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> the difference between a sign</font>

56
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,179
and allocate

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,220
in this talk will use them

58
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,200
interchangeably but there really is a

59
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,050
distinction when an address registry

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,780
assigns a block<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's to an end user and</font>

61
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,060
it's not a block to be subdivided and

62
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,360
handed out to customers if its allocated

63
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,300
its allocated to an ISP and then it said

64
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,680
assigned to customers and this talk will

65
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,810
use them interchangeably but they're

66
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,340
always assignments and allocations from

67
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,349
a registry so they're not said

68
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,310
allocations and an ISP would do to its

69
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:39,298
customers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look at the also a</font>

70
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit at the routing table</font>

71
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:43,290
evolution but again with an allocation

72
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,269
and assignment slant and some

73
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:49,980
conclusions and I came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some more</font>

74
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:51,989
in my sleep last night so again this is

75
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,390
what I just talked about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

76
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:56,160
policy changes again are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the change</font>

77
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,279
to cider and I have some slides on that

78
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that are no big surprise and the</font>

79
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">change from a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 19 to 20 what we really</font>

80
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:10,260
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if it had any effect at</font>

81
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:13,319
all so how have the address assignments

82
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,388
been performed what are the block sizes

83
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,040
over time those sorts of things what are

84
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:18,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">the distribution of prefix went the</font>

85
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,670
length and again these are of

86
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:23,540
allocations and assignments so let's

87
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,910
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these charts so in 1993</font>

88
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,578
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we had you know cider was</font>

89
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,769
deployed it's no big<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprise that you</font>

90
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,389
know that the allocations were 16 or 24

91
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:36,329
hurts because that's all we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

92
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:38,549
the three bears you know the /a it was

93
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,889
too big<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the / 24 was she small in</font>

94
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:45,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">the / 16 was just right only it wasn't</font>

95
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:47,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was huge so and then after cider a</font>

96
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,359
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sized prefixes started</font>

97
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,840
being assigned so there's no big

98
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:54,480
surprise there again when we change from

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,010
a 19 to 20 again there's no really huge

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,780
surprise it used to be that there were a

101
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,810
lot of 20s allocated now<font color="#E5E5E5"> there I mean</font>

102
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:04,139
19th now there are a lot of 20 so no big

103
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:07,049
surprise there now if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

104
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:09,269
allocated blocks over time these were

105
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,500
going to I was thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about removing</font>

106
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,209
these from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides because they're a</font>

107
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
little bit deceptive but nonetheless are

108
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit interesting at the same</font>

109
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,839
time so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the different</font>

110
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,200
years you see the allocation of blocks

111
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,799
over time just how men

112
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,780
and the yellow is what the grad students

113
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,600
called non-aligned blocks which is the

114
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:32,260
part that's a little bit deceptive one

115
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,060
of the registries does a assignment and

116
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,969
allocation in the database slightly

117
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:39,190
different than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the others so if if a</font>

118
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,770
block gets assigned say a company can

119
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,740
only justify like a 19 and a 20 but not

120
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,780
a whole 18 in the database<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

121
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:49,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">as one contiguous non</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bid a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> line block</font>

122
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,650
even though it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really two bit of line</font>

123
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,330
blocks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's assigned as two-bit</font>

124
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">aligned blocks and then there's usually</font>

125
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,830
a reserved space for the rest of the 18

126
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,120
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then if they go back in the right</font>

127
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,880
amount of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> they fill</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up that space</font>

128
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then they have 118 so it's a way of</font>

129
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,300
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to promote aggravate aggregation</font>

130
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,280
aggravation and but in the database they

131
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,510
didn't know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they're not you</font>

132
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,489
know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't got a registry meetings</font>

133
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,960
they don't get address space from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

134
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,390
registry so it wasn't something that

135
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,280
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought of there are however a few</font>

136
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:22,419
really interesting non-aligned blocks

137
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,070
and I have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example later on also</font>

138
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,960
notice that there are blocks that are a

139
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:29,110
sign that are longer than the minimum

140
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:34,380
allocation and most of these are because

141
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:36,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the micro allocation policies and</font>

142
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,020
again the scales a little bit different

143
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,960
so there aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a huge number of</font>

144
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,060
these non-aligned ones so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

they show up in the database but they

165
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">really are and so we're going to tease</font>

166
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,700
those out and include them appropriately

167
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,320
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> datasets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's just so small</font>

170
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,860
so how do how do these allocated and

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,800
assign blocks appear in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> routing</font>

00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,110
are they fragmented I'm going to talk

about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more how long after</font>

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,860
their allocated do they show up in the

178
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,470
appear at all we all know there are but

179
00:06:53,140 --> 00:07:00,849
we've quantified that we've looked at we

180
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:03,280
use the right data we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the route</font>

181
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:06,190
views data and compared some of that to

182
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,780
the links<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and as you know we don't</font>

183
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,370
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nowhere that you can look on the</font>

184
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,900
internet and get a full picture of what

185
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,490
the routing table looks like from every

186
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,669
vantage point but we feel like we've got

187
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,920
a pretty good handle on it the total

188
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:23,380
prefix is allocated in our studies here

189
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:25,480
in 190 554 so if you all to prefixes

190
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,730
appear this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a month-by-month graph of</font>

191
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,990
the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of allocations and the green</font>

192
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,480
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones that have never been</font>

193
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,310
advertised so as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see over time</font>

194
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,460
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are certainly blocks that don't</font>

195
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,890
get advertised and it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like in 2002</font>

196
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:43,690
there a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them compared to the</font>

197
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:45,280
number that are allocated um this is one

198
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,840
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interesting things that I don't</font>

199
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,599
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have thought of looking</font>

200
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,460
at necessarily but they did and I think

201
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,729
it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cool so they looked at the</font>

202
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:57,489
difference between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of time</font>

203
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:59,229
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> when a block gets allocated and</font>

204
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,360
it shows up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database and when it</font>

205
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,800
shows up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> table and as you</font>

206
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,630
can see there's a hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

207
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,060
allocations and have a delay that are

208
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,070
greater than 400 so there's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

209
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,620
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> timeframe there's that they pick</font>

210
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,659
there's still a lot of outliers but the

211
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,430
really interesting thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is</font>

212
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,890
interesting is this graph I mean this

213
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,870
chart I i removed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blocks because</font>

214
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:22,810
well I kind of looked old I probably

215
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,150
should so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I didn't want this to</font>

216
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">be an exposé or whatever but they're a</font>

217
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,570
bunch of blocks and their allocation

218
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,210
date and notice that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some from</font>

219
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:33,549
each of the regional registries and lack

220
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,098
Nick was too new to really to really

221
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,650
tell but this actually shows that

222
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,719
there's a negative delay so it's showing

223
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:42,338
up in the routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> table significant</font>

224
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,380
amounts<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time before it shows up in</font>

225
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:47,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">the database is being assigned</font>

226
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,790
so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out and I</font>

227
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,260
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Richard quite a bit last night</font>

228
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:56,000
about what some of these could be he

229
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:59,540
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some of them might be trans</font>

230
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,399
transfers that in Aaron's case when they

231
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,230
transfer from one organization to

232
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,810
another it shows up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database as a</font>

233
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,850
new allocation with a new start

234
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,520
allocation date so some of these might

235
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:13,310
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some of them look like they were</font>

236
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,699
they were assignments back before there

237
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:18,800
was an errand or<font color="#E5E5E5"> raipur ap Nick so maybe</font>

238
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,450
they weren't actually in the database

239
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,949
but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to change their and</font>

240
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,540
adder or something and then they ended

241
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,190
up showing up in the database so we're

242
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,750
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process of looking at them but</font>

243
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,600
it's pretty significant time in fifteen

244
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,149
hundred days that a prefix get to get to

245
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,060
advertised before before it gets

246
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:38,450
assigned by the registry that's pretty

247
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:40,160
pretty big so how exactly do the

248
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,320
allocations show up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing table</font>

249
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,959
are they show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as they're</font>

250
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,760
allocated are they fragmented are they

251
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,459
aggregated I have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> examples</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

252
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">the last four or combination so if it's</font>

253
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:52,939
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the graphs if it shows up as</font>

254
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,470
identical then then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

255
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,450
advertisement for that block is

256
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:58,310
identical to the allocation<font color="#E5E5E5"> links and</font>

257
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,920
then there are combinations at the

258
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,270
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is an example I don't</font>

259
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,370
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through it but</font>

260
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:07,579
if it's a 16<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's advertised as a</font>

261
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,990
16 and if it's fragmented then the 16

262
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:12,649
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but some of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fragments</font>

263
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:14,540
are so anyway so we look at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

264
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:16,790
these graphs this is for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

265
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,949
allocated prefixes in our study period

266
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:22,490
and some interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> things to take note</font>

267
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:24,589
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are that forty-eight percent are</font>

268
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,810
advertised as identical to how they're

269
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:29,060
allocated but there's a whole bunch that

270
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:32,660
a bed<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't so another forty percent</font>

271
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:35,300
are some variation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fragmented which</font>

272
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,370
means means a lot of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> but to me if</font>

273
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,859
you're looking at changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the policy it</font>

274
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,630
might mean that maybe you don't want to

275
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,610
start defining little assignments to

276
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,560
each person who comes because for forty

277
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,060
percent of the prefixes an ISP was

278
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,500
trying to save the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers from killing</font>

279
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,229
over could filter out those more

280
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,880
specifics and and turn down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routing</font>

281
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,380
table and still be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to those</font>

282
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,189
prefixes I mean there's lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

283
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,950
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could say about that but</font>

284
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,870
that's the thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> strikes me today</font>

285
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:04,830
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at these more individually</font>

286
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:06,900
for / 16 they change a little bit more

287
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">over time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than just the the whole</font>

288
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,459
picture they have a higher fragmentation

289
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:15,240
rate than than any other size block we

290
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:17,700
looked at they also seem to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get it</font>

291
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,830
replaced instead of just being identical

292
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,110
they gets replaced with mostly with

293
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,970
identical plus a fragment to somebody's

294
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,160
injecting a hole for one reason or

295
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,620
another out of these 16 so that's why

296
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,839
the identical line that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the blue line is</font>

297
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">going down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the little I don't know</font>

298
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,480
if how well these are to see the little

299
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:38,550
turquoise bubbly things are going up it

300
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,080
might be good actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you pull up</font>

301
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,670
these slides on the web if you're

302
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,560
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and looking at them</font>

303
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:46,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">because some of them later on or a</font>

304
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,689
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more difficult so 19 I</font>

305
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:51,959
actually didn't find this overly

306
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,820
surprising they tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be advertised as</font>

307
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,560
19th and I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

308
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,440
filtering policies that we had for so

309
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,079
long and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

310
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,590
wholeheartedly enforce those policies 19

311
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,860
seem to be you know really highly

312
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:10,470
identical to how they're advertised

313
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,990
three twenties are also interesting

314
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,540
because the 20s can tend mostly to be

315
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,580
aggregated into 19 so if you get a Gris

316
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,620
if you get allocated 20s from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

317
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,240
registry over time you're more likely to

318
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,040
aggregate them and you're more likely to

319
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,020
aggregate them into<font color="#E5E5E5"> 19th and again I</font>

320
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,329
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was an artifact as the</font>

321
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:31,100
policies the filtering policies that

322
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:33,900
were beaten into our heads<font color="#CCCCCC"> for so long</font>

323
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:38,850
okay this graph shows the average<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

324
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:41,459
of prefixes of fragments of allocated

325
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,650
prefixes which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hovers around 14</font>

326
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:47,730
the little blips that are way up near

327
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:50,819
the top around mar 30 are because of

328
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:54,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">addi aggregation event of net 63 / 10</font>

329
00:12:50,820 --> 00:13:00,020
and the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so over x it grows</font>

330
00:12:54,330 --> 00:13:00,020
a little bit but it averages around 14

331
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:07,120
so one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to</font>

332
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:08,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">know was everybody talks about how / 24</font>

333
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,310
is there a big component of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routing</font>

334
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:15,939
table and I kind of wanted to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

335
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:18,219
are those allocated is less 24 so how

336
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,710
many / 24<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> routing table are</font>

337
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,960
actually allocated as / 24 s and how

338
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,160
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> d aggregations and we</font>

339
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,440
could have done this for any length

340
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,360
prefix but since / 24 is the largest

341
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,900
component<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now we decided we'd look</font>

342
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:34,060
at those first so of the length of the

343
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:38,199
allocated blocks is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> x-axis and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

344
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:40,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">little little towers are how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

345
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:46,210
advertised in an aggregate so like out

346
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:48,550
of a thousand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight / 18 140 42 or</font>

347
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,410
advertised as part of an aggregate so

348
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,910
this kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives you an idea of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

349
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,910
amount of aggregation that's going on

350
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:00,910
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> see this shows that ten percent of</font>

351
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,770
the allocated blocks contribute to

352
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,050
seventy percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the routing prefixes</font>

353
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:07,090
and ninety percent of the allocation

354
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:08,319
allocated blocks contribute less than

355
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,960
thirty percent of the routing table

356
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,730
prefixes so you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that the</font>

357
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,680
stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was talked about earlier of</font>

358
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,500
going out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and trying to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people to</font>

359
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,510
aggregate you know it's a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> small</font>

360
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:22,710
target and probably could do a lot of

361
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:26,260
good if you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to those ten percent</font>

362
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:30,220
so here's some more on the / 24 so

363
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:32,800
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1993 you know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of / 24 s</font>

364
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,870
were allocated a big no big surprise it

365
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,280
was that it was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> model where sunday</font>

366
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,230
will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aggregate them so let's</font>

367
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,890
give somebody you know 30 of them

368
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,720
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the / 16 so and over time</font>

369
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,939
fewer and fewer of them are allocated so

370
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,480
this is just a number allocated per year

371
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:52,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then if we look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at / 24</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s as</font>

372
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,520
fragments of larger allocations so year

373
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:56,350
by year you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

374
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,460
are fragments<font color="#CCCCCC"> of larger allocations</font>

375
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,840
especially like in 99 and 94 but some of

376
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,670
the early ones I think are<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

377
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,020
because people just never aggregated a

378
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:09,360
master they could aggregate them

379
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:12,210
and this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> breakdown of flash</font>

380
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,280
twenty-fours fragments heard the size of

381
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,760
the block that they're at their d

382
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:21,120
aggregated from so like for a / 16 there

383
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,980
are fourteen thousand and 307<font color="#CCCCCC"> / 24</font>

384
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:34,920
fragments out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> fourteen hundred and</font>

385
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:38,130
six / 16 so 58,000 329 are fragmented

386
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,990
from larger allocation blocks and most

387
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:46,650
of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these came from most of them</font>

388
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:48,690
came from / aids through / 23 so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

389
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,160
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> per country I guess they</font>

390
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,050
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that maybe it would be cool to</font>

391
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,600
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if somebody is worse than somebody</font>

392
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:56,699
else country wise at aggregating or<font color="#E5E5E5"> D</font>

393
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,850
aggregating and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font>

394
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,590
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same so the u.s. is</font>

395
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,810
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> six point eight percent so the</font>

396
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:06,030
average<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of routing entries from a</font>

from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Negra from our that are</font>

398
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:10,189
fragmented from an allocation block or

399
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:13,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">six point eight in the u.s. 6.7 in china</font>

400
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:15,420
6.2 in japan<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they're pretty pretty</font>

401
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,270
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same it seems like Canada does</font>

402
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:22,589
a really good job of aggregation yay go

403
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:26,220
team so let's see changes in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> global</font>

404
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:28,080
routing table so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how how</font>

405
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,000
the allocations some more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how they</font>

406
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,310
show up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing table how many</font>

407
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,680
prefixes get added how many prefixes go

408
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:37,439
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> and where do they go things like</font>

409
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and also when they talked when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

410
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,910
talked about IP address is being

411
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,319
consumed it's basically they aren't

412
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,360
necessarily reachable but they're

413
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,420
represented by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> routes in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the routing</font>

414
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">table so if / 24 is in the routing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> table</font>

415
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:55,920
then then that address space represented

416
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,420
by that / 24 is is consumed even if you

417
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,339
know three of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses or whatever</font>

418
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,118
all of them aren't reachable the routes

419
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:04,579
there

420
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:07,520
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a standard graph of the</font>

421
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:10,730
growth of the routing table<font color="#E5E5E5"> size and if</font>

422
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,250
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look on the graph on the right the</font>

423
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:16,010
dashed line is the the amount of

424
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,349
allocated address space and the blue

425
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:20,329
line I hope you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys have colors the</font>

426
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:22,069
blue line is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount of address space</font>

427
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:24,709
that's actually represented by the

428
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:29,510
routes in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing table so it's</font>

429
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:30,890
consumed as we call it in the paper so

430
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:34,960
the routing table size in our study

431
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:37,429
period changed from 53,000 some routes

432
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,669
214,000 routes and depending on your

433
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:42,710
view of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world that could have can</font>

434
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:44,450
change so the growth has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been really</font>

435
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,039
huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again the growth and address</font>

436
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:48,169
based consumptions of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font>

437
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:51,440
address space represented by the routes

438
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:57,320
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing table has only grown 26.3</font>

439
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:59,029
percent and let's see pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good so</font>

440
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,799
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their new advertisements in the</font>

442
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,639
in our study period was<font color="#CCCCCC"> eighty seven</font>

443
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">thousand nine hundred and forty-one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

444
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,029
we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rate of the</font>

445
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationship between those and</font>

446
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:13,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">allocations so eighty eight point four</font>

447
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:15,668
percent of them are fragments of<font color="#E5E5E5"> larger</font>

448
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,649
allocations ten percent of them are

449
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:20,539
allocations of equal size and a little

450
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:23,989
smaller ones are aggregations of

451
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:27,080
multiple smaller allocations so let's

452
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:28,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at this so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where the new</font>

453
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,779
advertisements come from as far as a

454
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:34,520
year so these are allocated blocks from

455
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:36,080
these years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and which ones how many</font>

456
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,490
showed up in the routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> table and then</font>

457
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:42,070
by country so the US had the most and

458
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,510
the other ones are smaller so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

459
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:47,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's no surprise we have more d</font>

460
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:50,860
aggregation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess we're more prefixes</font>

461
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:55,390
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at the pie chart</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

462
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:57,399
pie<font color="#E5E5E5"> chart</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say the fragmented ones so</font>

463
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,820
when advertisements leave the routing

464
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,860
table some of them get discarded so

465
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,570
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not represented by anything</font>

466
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,129
some of them get aggregated a lot of

467
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,570
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> get aggregated like seventy-seven</font>

468
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:10,270
percent of them get aggregated into

469
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:11,980
other prefixes so one prefix may go<font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font>

470
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,110
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets replaced by another one and</font>

471
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">then some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them get further fragmented</font>

472
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:18,719
so the prefix itself went away but then

473
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:23,290
there are more fragments sitting there

474
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:26,230
that's see this is going faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> than I</font>

475
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:29,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought okay so this is a breakdown of</font>

476
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:31,720
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> newly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> announced prefixes by length</font>

477
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,830
prefix length and they're like we said

478
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,780
before there are a lot of slush

479
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:37,120
twenty-fours but there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

480
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,100
other ones too and if they're all

481
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,810
fragments of larger allocated blocks

482
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:44,790
then a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these little guys get</font>

483
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:47,860
filtered out and you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still reachable</font>

484
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:50,200
the one of the ones that went away so

485
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,600
there's you know there's 30,000 that

486
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,520
went away and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80,000 that showed up</font>

487
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,100
twenty-two thousand of them were / 24 so

488
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,840
they're still they go away and they come

489
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:03,129
you know they cut there are new ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

490
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:06,600
then they're ones that go<font color="#CCCCCC"> away and the</font>

491
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:09,130
impact on address consumption so when

492
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,010
prefixes go away there's there's still

493
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:14,500
the discarded prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's see here</font>

494
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:17,680
sorry so the total number of address is

495
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,630
covered by the prefixes was 2,400,000

496
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,420
and the total<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of addresses that</font>

497
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,710
drop off was<font color="#E5E5E5"> only 131,000 so there's a</font>

498
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,150
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them that become unreachable</font>

499
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:30,150
but there are a lot of them that just

500
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:33,190
get re<font color="#E5E5E5"> re represented by other prefixes</font>

501
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:35,920
so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> our observations no big</font>

502
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:38,140
surprise allocations play a dominant

503
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">role in the routing table size because</font>

504
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:43,660
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to advertise your</font>

505
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,460
address space to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it reachable so</font>

506
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,900
when we hand out blocks it's no big

507
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,640
surprise<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cables going</font>

508
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to grow on some level hopefully people</font>

509
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:56,640
aggregate better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> than they you know</font>

510
00:20:52,110 --> 00:21:00,030
they do it well the 19 to 20 change it

511
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,730
had an impact but I'm not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

512
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:05,240
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it had an impact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be any</font>

513
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:07,830
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> than if we'd stayed at a 19</font>

514
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,840
now that's not to say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should go</font>

515
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,639
I still don't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we should go</font>

516
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,500
and give everybody a portable prefix

517
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,880
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't part of a provider block even</font>

518
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,410
if they punch a hole<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that provider</font>

519
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,929
book because it takes away your ability

520
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:22,440
as an ISP<font color="#CCCCCC"> to filter it out but that's my</font>

521
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:24,780
opinion also remember that there's no

522
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,049
requirement that an allocation get

523
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:29,970
advertised in a particular way<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you</font>

524
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:32,340
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go and you get a block from</font>

525
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:34,260
an NRI are there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no requirement that</font>

526
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,909
you advertise it aggregated or

527
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,740
fragmented and maybe some guidelines

528
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:39,960
would be good but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

529
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:43,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the role of the registries to do</font>

530
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,140
that so what we would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know is</font>

531
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:50,010
whether this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is interesting what other</font>

532
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:52,200
things you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful if you</font>

533
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,320
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions or comments that would be</font>

534
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,320
great

535
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:12,099
nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we really want feedback</font>

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,920
protection is actually much larger than

00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see I mean we have seen from about</font>

540
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,650
what few dozen<font color="#CCCCCC"> tears that we have</font>

541
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:33,440
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like 350,000 distinct legal</font>

543
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,390
for a short time or appear only for

544
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,710
certain tears totally endearing crowds

547
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,010
