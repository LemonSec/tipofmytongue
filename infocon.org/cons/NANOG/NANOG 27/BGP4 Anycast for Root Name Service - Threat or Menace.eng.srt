we're trying to do a better way uses

we're doing and the technical<font color="#CCCCCC"> details</font>

are ya to follow using gate<font color="#CCCCCC"> D and zebra</font>

77
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:45,560
for ospf you assign a single service

basically what what we're doing looks

84
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:12,209
like once we have an igp that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,769
among multiple boxes and we have the

redundancy of multiple switches and

87
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:21,199

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,850

to this for for actual load balancing

92
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,630
them because geography does not equal

93
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,729
topology because a esas can be very big

94
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,669
and there's no visibility provided by

95
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,840
the AAS pass and there's a certain

96
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:45,210
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dependence on other people's</font>

you know our questions but<font color="#CCCCCC"> C is run by</font>

the provisioning that they've applied

for

206
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:04,770

through these kinds of techniques

217
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:37,950
there's a few questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hear a lot</font>

when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> say oh we're doing this do we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">no you can't yes we retain</font>

224

administrative control we run the boxes

225
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:59,730
and we work closely with the partner at

226
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:02,990
the location have we provisioned how to

227

van monitoring and troubleshooting yes

228
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:09,260
and we talked a little bit about that we

229
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:12,060
can talk some more fair questions and

230
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:16,080
why not let<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice please do it ISPs run</font>

networks that's what they do well they

232
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,980
run the networks and we run root name

the integrity of the data you know we

were there to provide that specific

about gay<font color="#CCCCCC"> while we are focusing first on</font>

243
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:06,440
on improving in God diversity so we have

244
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,510
first plans to run nsv on k and then

245
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,860
focusing on the any testing we already

246
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:15,260
have the servers in two locations Adam

248
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:22,970

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> next year that's it yeah yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

250
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually an important point I think</font>

251
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,440
obvio so mentioned but another way of

252
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,560
improving the reliability of the service

253
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:34,610
is to diversify the software used to

254
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,189
provide it pretty much everybody has

255
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,300
multiple boxes there's a diversity of

256
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,150
operating system and network

257
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:45,290
provisioning technology behind the root

258
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:47,840
servers but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition it will be good</font>

259
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:50,180
to have more different implementations

260
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:56,080
of the DNS answering queries for the

261
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:56,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">root anybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

262
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,569
Oh
