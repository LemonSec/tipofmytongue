5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:19,140
agenda is a little bit off because I

have gotten to the RP it's already too

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,419
late so but that made for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a better sound</font>

10
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:32,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">byte I guess okay so there'll only be</font>

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,360
the slide because we just want to get

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,390
the message across and not don't want to

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,160
distract our vendors from this 200

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,200
megabytes attacks are trivial to

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,140
generate and the internet machine gun

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,110
could do this in 1994 and as we've seen

20
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,629
this is from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the recent slammer ones</font>

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,780
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not out of reach for a single</font>

24
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:12,479

slammer attacks will seem like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a memory</font>

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,759
of heaven if these guys decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

28
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:24,809
out the routers I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking slowly so</font>

29
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,939
people can understand this a hundred

megabytes per second attack directed at

31
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,860
any router in the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> today with</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exception of perhaps avicii those</font>

33
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:40,200
guys who actually paid attention to this

34
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:44,579
will destroy the router get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,229
odd it's not the mega bits it's the

36
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,000
packets per second right so it's

37
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually worse than negatives so simply</font>

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,840
speaking the vendors and we got other

39
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,850
vendors in here you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,960
problem i'm working on it's not megabits

41
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's packets for a second that okay wax</font>

42
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,960
it and so it's a lot easier than

43
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,490
megabits per second right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting this out as a harder bargain so</font>

45
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,089
we know so we know target the vendors

46
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,160
should be working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on right right so</font>

47
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,369
others can work on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> too right PPS</font>

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,519
this is a symptom

49
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:15,620
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so now we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

50
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:17,060
the slammer worm dead now assuming that

51
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,040
the slammer worm had been quoted by

52
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,569
somebody more malicious and all the

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,670
needed to do was run trade routes from

54
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:25,849
each infected host and then start

55
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,379
directing packet streams at the far side

56
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,510
of the trace route and work their way

57
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:32,620
back that verb destroyed the entire

58
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:35,120
global Internet in I guess five minutes

59
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:39,799
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the magnitude of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,980
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing here why this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

61
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:45,109
packets per second bits per second this

62
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,319
is irrelevant all this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends</font>

63
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:51,140
upon is the attack point at that point

64
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,470
is the connection between the line cards

65
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,920
and the brain of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router this is a</font>

66
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:59,870
bottleneck because there is no

67
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:03,140
economical way to make a router that has

68
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:06,590
as much bandwidth to the RP as it does

69
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:09,619
through the box you can always<font color="#CCCCCC"> send more</font>

70
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:14,510
traffic to the box and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box can</font>

71
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:17,319
digest what we really need and this goes

72
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:21,950
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what they've said earlier is</font>

73
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:25,130
line rate decryption of packets at the

74
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:27,560
line card level at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the port level of the</font>

75
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:30,319
line card so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can quickly disambiguate</font>

76
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,470
good from bad people will say why don't

77
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">we put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on md5 checksums for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

sessions that is not going to help

79
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,399
because the md5 checksums in most

80
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,849
implementations are decoded at the RP in

81

fact having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the additional</font>

82
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,780
load of the MV digest probably

constitutes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Doss attack in and of</font>

84

itself so basically skipping all this we

85
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">just go to the root of the problem is</font>

86
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:03,019
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to disambiguate</font>

valid protocol packets from invalid

protocol packets without putting some

89
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:11,569
sort of goo in the protocols and on the

line cards attackers have attacked<font color="#E5E5E5"> vgb</font>

00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:16,940
and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> i bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vgp up is because</font>

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the worst case scenario if we</font>

94
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,000
else almost essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> falls of free</font>

95
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,159
and in BGP I put things like ms.vp as

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,930
well anything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has an external state</font>

97
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:34,840
that you need to communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

98
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:36,700
neighbor so the problem we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> some way</font>

99
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,510
to disambiguate between invalid and

100
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:44,500
valid control packets and those and

101
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:46,380
those things are hard to do because it's

102
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,540
very easy to generate what looks like a

150
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,979
decide what's what's interesting to us

00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:54,050
so first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we can apply a</font>

156
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:11,599
a good start but we need to expand on

157

that some more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideally once we have</font>

with md5 in current implementations all

the decryption is done on the RP

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:57,919
therefore it's too late already so what

174
00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:00,919
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a dynamic filtering on the</font>

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,130
don't change much so that once you've

263
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,839
applied you once you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> eaten the cost</font>

264
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,209
of rolling it out with like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 400 adders</font>

265
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:16,410
and like 10,000 interfaces it's fairly

266
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:19,160
static so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP TTL hacked applies the</font>

TTL as an input into the discriminator

268
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,600
now the problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is that it is</font>

269
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:27,060
fairly easy if a router immediately

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,690

271
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:33,000
act you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can rewrite the line card to</font>

is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a panacea that solves all</font>

the attacker faster than the cost of the

278
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,260

280
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,410

time breaking in and hacking into

00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:58,400
routers in the path before a network

00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:07,130
they would<font color="#E5E5E5"> today and again packet filter</font>

that everybody influenced us we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

313
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:41,030
like make a change in the protocol you

can have to dl 255 without disabling the

networks who looked at sprint AOL<font color="#CCCCCC"> vario</font>

317
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:52,700
we had maybe less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> one percent of</font>

321
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,790
majority of our sessions are we can have

324
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,530

was put all control offline separate

334
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:41,750
simpler solution to this particular

335
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:45,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem cheaper certainly to just pretty</font>

on a physical wire and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I guess</font>

338
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:57,920
we'll only have 50 50 56k for data and

00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,150
and and the remaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> for control but</font>

340
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,110
that that will give you a much cheaper

344
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,520
the original ARPANET designers went

345
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,380
through this argument they there were

346
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,270
people back in the day arguing for

347
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,430
separation of control and data and the

348
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:25,280
original<font color="#E5E5E5"> designers thought that if that</font>

349
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:27,170
was not a good idea and we are

350
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,810
evaluating that and essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font>

351
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,790
have the decrypted routing updates is

352
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:33,530
that we have moved to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an out-of-band</font>

out-of-band control channel runs in bed

355
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:40,699
because if you if you encapsulate all

356
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:43,790
your control traffic into a tunnel if

you would an ipsec tunnel or or whatever

359
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:55,430

that sort of stuff it'd be nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

429
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,410
guys could quantify the number of

430
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:23,419
security associations that need to be

431
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,030
implemented<font color="#CCCCCC"> in hardware is it a hundred</font>

432
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,970
is it a thousand

433
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:33,129
I can quantify that right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

434
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:37,570
one essay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for bgp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> session and since AES</font>

435
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:40,030
is such a large block size you don't

436
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:42,879
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> occur the key for thousands of</font>

437
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:45,100
years so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really set up your</font>

438
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,010
security associations every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

439
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,540
variables yeah my question means are we

440
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,000
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this solution for a lot of</font>

441
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:54,550
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things just not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DGP and MSPB and</font>

442
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,040
that's what I'm questioning so we need a

443
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,960
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean do you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know</font>

444
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,940
secure flows that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going into the</font>

445
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,210
router for other reasons that sort of

446
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,640
thing telnet estates well those views

447
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:09,220
not mean yes Floetry run like we don't

448
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">allow outside access I'm not too</font>

449
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,910
concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> security of the of the</font>

450
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,380
flows through the router I'm not

451
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,960
concerned about security of the end user

452
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't really care all they really care</font>

453
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,740
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is hardening the infrastructure</font>

454
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:22,690
just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very minimum needed garden</font>

455
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:26,500
infrastructure everything else will fall

456
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:31,960
out of that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go back to your</font>

457
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:33,880
diagram the box diagram that one yeah so

458
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,080
so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of understand because I</font>

459
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are flipping back and forth</font>

460
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,389
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we especially we talk about ssl</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd</font>

461
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:42,820
be sacking you know where where things

462
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:45,520
need to happen is before that that

463
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:48,129
pointed it says point of attack because

464
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,260
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the legacy of how we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rowden that's</font>

465
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:51,630
the thing we<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta attack whether it's a</font>

466
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:55,000
distributor architecture or centralized

467
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:58,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">ford and architecture when once you get</font>

468
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,630
to that point if you do ssl on RP well

469
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,520
you know right you know and you've got a

470
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,620
decryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> after recent attack its</font>

471
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,760
remember packets per second because<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

472
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,820
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of little package that look like</font>

473
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,230
bgp with ssl keys in there or and go

474
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,820
straight through that point of attack

475
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you still got the same problem so</font>

476
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,830
where the problem set for everybody else

477
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:20,290
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work on is you to push it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

478
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,490
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect that point and you</font>

479
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:23,649
meant you mentioned it but it was kind

480
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,860
of like the second to last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one on the</font>

481
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,860
slide here

482
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:35,040
and this is why you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do want to</font>

483
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,650
do it for with ipsec tunnel<font color="#E5E5E5"> because then</font>

484
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,300
the routing processor which is where bgp

485
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:41,880
runs he's not going to see any of that

486
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:45,780
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a packet</font>

487
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,630
that has has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> vouched for by the</font>

488
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,730
line card skimming yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why we put</font>

489
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,560
it on second to<font color="#E5E5E5"> last point on the slide</font>

490
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:56,520
we are aware of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yes thank you right</font>

491
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:58,169
so you cannot use said so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

492
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,050
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Crypt on the line card because the</font>

493
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:02,370
pipe to the RP is too small well in

494
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,860
current can we do to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that problem</font>

495
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:08,610
too current deployed architectures

496
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:11,669
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we this is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RP line card</font>

497
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:14,429
to our piece is the weak point and with

498
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:15,990
the huge amount of capital<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know we've</font>

499
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,720
got on the order of like half a billion

500
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:21,870
boss already sunk we're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

501
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,250
upgrading those anytime<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon especially</font>

502
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:26,729
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> our accountants are pulling for</font>

503
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,190
like five year amortization time so yes

504
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">we would want it keeping a current</font>

installed base of on daughter of

506
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:37,560
billions in mind we will want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do line</font>

507
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,600
card upgrades to get that for future

508
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,669
vendors of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,530
flexibility available right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that we're we're trying to</font>

511
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:47,520
engineer kind of a system<font color="#CCCCCC"> level solution</font>

512
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,620
here and we may have multiple

513
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,629
instantiations of solutions given right

514
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,790
under where you start yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your</font>

515
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:59,460
processor can actually take line guard

516
00:23:53,790 --> 00:24:01,700
and not crash that's ideal Dave any last
