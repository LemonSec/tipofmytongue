00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,839

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,850
and we put this together as a result of

10
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:25,740
feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> from our communities</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:30,330

the rars and they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it in</font>

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,489
one presentation so this is something we

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:45,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">we put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together and we periodically</font>

17
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:48,539

46
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,740
however the rars discovered that it was

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:10,840
there's 17 / aids that had

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,690
asked Diana to take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> space back and</font>

63
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:58,360

69
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,980
basically just here to show the growth

74
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:31,209

75
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,580
decline in 2002 in v4 allocations in the

ripe region and in the air in region and

77
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,080
actually even in the lac<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> region</font>

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,620
stayed the same actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> they think they</font>

81
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:48,100
increased slightly by one I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

83
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:57,790
so it was real different between the

regions<font color="#E5E5E5"> um in 2002 so civ4 allocations</font>

the cumulative totals in that four year

88
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,620
period 99 to 2002 how much space we

92
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,429
remember that's only a four year period

93
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,830
not from the beginning

94
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:25,680
on these are ASM assignments made by the

95
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,990
rars to various organizations its yearly

96

comparison again for year south of time

97
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:34,440
and shows a growth<font color="#E5E5E5"> trend um basically</font>

98
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,630
again 1999-2000 saw a real increase

99
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,690
particularly in the Aaron region we find

100
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,040
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 2500</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SMS that year and then</font>

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,000
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ER</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> region started to see a decline</font>

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,320
down we find less asm's on the right

110
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,260

111
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:13,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">add that the left next step although</font>

separate the data for lack Nick from our

numbers and go back over the four-year

117
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:33,390
period and so the asm's ipv4 and ipv6

00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:35,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">assignments for lack mix so this again</font>

124
00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:00,150
i'll move to ipv6 allocations from the

<font color="#E5E5E5">the four year period something to note</font>

127
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,070
here is that the first ipv6 allocation

was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually made in nineteen nineteen</font>

things we see 140 and this number is

143
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,780
current as of December 31st so the

144
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,090
numbers have actually increased since

145
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:55,789
then we've all made additional v6

146
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:58,280
allocation since then and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided to</font>

147
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,900
add a country code slide in here on

148
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,840
people are interested in where the v6

149
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,429
space is being used and so when I'm

150
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,080
excited to show the top five countries

151

158
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:33,080
277 e6 allocations that had been made by

and the IRS<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they've listed before</font>

169
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:59,600
our IR links for the statistics there's

170

time and the one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would ask is if</font>

193
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:59,420
make a beef sixer when the registries

194
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:03,620
makes a v6 allocation how big a company

195
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:05,748
or an organization gets it it depends

196
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,749
we've allocated to small organizations

197
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:11,870
to universities to vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> too large</font>

198
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:13,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's total like hell yes I should</font>

199
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,129
actually mention before we do this the

200
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:19,009
number's unlisted or actually / 30 tues

201
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:21,319
and / 35 the registries operate under a

202
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:24,079
single ipv6 policy so we're all using

203
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:25,370
the same criteria and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking on</font>

204
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:28,029
all of our websites if anyone is

205
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:31,970
interested but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very it's the</font>

206
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:33,800
criteria is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very complicated and in</font>

207
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,629
fact I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you that in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron's</font>

208
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,319
four-year history we have rejected

209
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:41,779
flat-out denied only three ipv6 request

210
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:43,699
out of well over seventy request that

211
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:46,699
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> received so it's very rare that</font>

212
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:49,849
someone gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> turned down it's pretty</font>

213
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:57,740
easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get ipv6 space so come to the f</font>

214
00:09:49,850 --> 00:10:01,579
we'd love it I'm sorry what actually it

215
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,110
wasn't it was because they there's two

216
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:05,508
different reasons I'm trying to think it

217
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,769
wasn't because they weren't ISPs that

218
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:08,689
was something that I had been asked

219
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:09,920
before I believe it was because they

220
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:11,899
were asking for less than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimum</font>

221
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,870
allocation<font color="#CCCCCC"> five in two of the cases they</font>

222
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:18,230
were asking for / 48 and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimum</font>

223
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:25,510
allocation size is / 32 now so yeah it

224
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:29,010
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes so anything else okay thank you</font>

225
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,010
all right Thank You<font color="#CCCCCC"> lessly</font>
