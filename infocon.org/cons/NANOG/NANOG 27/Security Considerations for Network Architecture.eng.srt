1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah so I've been looking obviously</font>

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:09,809
at things that cause networks to fail

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:12,120
for a number of years my current day job

4
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,440
at Akamai doesn't actually have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,969
do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because we worry about how</font>

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,919
to get content around even when they

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:20,490
work for failing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm still involved</font>

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,430
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> helping some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs including net</font>

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,528
access and I've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the years a</font>

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,630
large number of failures and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

11
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,698
patterns<font color="#E5E5E5"> in those failures also at</font>

12
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,278
Akamai we've been doing some security

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,520
vulnerability analysis for people and

14
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,750
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some common themes that we</font>

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,820
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weak points that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you find an</font>

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,070
infrastructure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main takeaway</font>

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,649
from this is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that there are some</font>

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,000
vendors who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in looking at</font>

19
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,590
some medium term things that can be done

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,719
with deployed hardware that don't cost

21
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,030
you more capex and if they're a network

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,039
operators special<font color="#CCCCCC"> medium sized ones who</font>

23
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,800
are interested in participating I think

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,090
that we could look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some modifications</font>

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,919
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing networks that would be</font>

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,060
main question that i<font color="#CCCCCC"> have really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,650

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,770
enough energy worrying about security

30
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,420
versus scalability<font color="#E5E5E5"> and reliability in</font>

other words Who am I appearing with Who

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,320
am I getting transit from what routers

33
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,600
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I using what failure votes they</font>

34

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,439
actually want to cause my network to

36
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,830
fail I think there's a growing awareness

37
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,210
that it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

38
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,590
filtering and protection and things that

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can do in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the routing infrastructure</font>

40
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,380
in the switching infrastructure and

41
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,030
you're out of band infrastructure when

42
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,199
you deploy your network but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I still</font>

43
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,350
think it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

internally and as architects running

46
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,110
networks that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about in</font>

47
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,759
terms of how we can use our existing

48
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,560
deployed equipment to make our network

49
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,780
better most people I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">large capital budgets this year anyone</font>

51
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,340
raise<font color="#CCCCCC"> your hand if you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a capital</font>

52
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,929
budget that is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than twenty-five</font>

53
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,710
percent of what your capital budget was

54
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,659
two years ago for this here we have a

55
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,610
few heads a few hands about more than

56
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,610
fifty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it was two years</font>

57
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:11,780
ago okay we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some hands on</font>

58
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:13,790
so so why worry really there are two two

59
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:18,790
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to address the</font>

60
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:22,399
first is that just by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Miss configuration</font>

61
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,590
and accidents we've had a lot of outages

62
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,560
that have had multi-hour effects on the

63
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure over the last five six</font>

64
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,500
years probably going back<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

65
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,350
further that relate to route

66
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,820
redistribution you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue back and</font>

67
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,190
forth whether you should have the

68
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:40,100
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to redistribute routes from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

69
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,109
into your<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP I know I have you know</font>

70
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,790
many evenings but the bottom line is

71
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,640
people use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and it's unlikely to be</font>

72
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,650
taken away as a capability but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,209
piece is if you run a national

74
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,390
infrastructure or global infrastructure

75
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:56,270
and you've got a backbone area which

76
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,609
stretches across a large portion of your

77
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,990
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you don't guarantee the</font>

78
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,750
physical security of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all your machines</font>

79
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:05,510
all it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes is five minutes for running</font>

80
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,280
for any field tech to go and type two

81
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,929
commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> in or reboot it with a flash</font>

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,390
and basically take down their network

83
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,950
and require you to physically touch all

84
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,750
your machines or your core routers to

85
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,820
get them back up one of the questions

86
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,920
that I have is what is the effect of

87
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,109
segmenting your backbone area

88
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,329
architecture whether it's eigrp is is

89
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,530
those in this configuration or because

90
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,510
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an attack and that's one of the</font>

91
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that I think that I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to get</font>

92
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:33,579
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better handle on as I work with</font>

93
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:36,950
different networks the other question is

94
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:39,560
what can be done to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so that the</font>

95
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">next worm which actually is targeting</font>

96
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,610
the infrastructure rather than affecting

97
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:47,390
the infrastructure by accident can be

98
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:49,790
mitigated we've seen a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of effect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

99
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,380
the edge in the routers at the edge<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

100
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,390
smaller networks and enterprise networks

101
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,209
and even that ripples through to

102
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,250
performance capacity CPU effect on

103
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,300
rather than the poor from worms that are

104
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,070
not designed to attack the

105
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,410
infrastructure it's just a secondary

106
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:05,750
benefit that they happen to do that in

107
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,160
terms of design but I think there's a

108
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of people have said what happens if</font>

109
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,799
you get a worm which uses force which

110
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,540
once it infects the hosts wakes up at

111
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,310
some point does trace routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> blast the</font>

112
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,510
routers with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ford source address let's</font>

113
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,200
say you had a million machines doing

114
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">that how do you protect your router</font>

115
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,190
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go find those machines that's</font>

116
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,650
a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question every time that we've</font>

117
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,080
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone moderately clue full with you</font>

118
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,950
know programming take a router and I'm

119
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,590
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick on any particular</font>

120
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,240
vendors but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know any of the common</font>

121
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,969
core routers which or edge routers which

122
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,560
have 100 Meg capacity to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU which</font>

123
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:41,340
is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the infrastructure</font>

124
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,580
and give them you know a gig of access

125
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,140
into a lab of routers they can wind up

126
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,820
finding packets of patterns which are

127
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,490
difficult to filter and which will

128
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,080
affect the CPU so one of the recurring

129
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,570
themes is people talk about future

130
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,030
architectures is separating the control

131
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:59,219
plane the CPU monitoring and things that

132
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,359
go on from the forwarding of packets and

133
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,870
I think that there may be some things

134
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in band physically but to</font>

135
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,530
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of logical out of</font>

136
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,270
band and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about that and that's</font>

137
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,380
another area that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that routing</font>

138
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,570
vendors what I've talked to would be

139
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,280
receptive about working together at

140
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,590
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in lab trials with people to try</font>

141
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,750
to build filtering mechanisms with its

142
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:23,130
mpls<font color="#CCCCCC"> airframe to get things like that</font>

143
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:25,710
going so that's in terms of CPU

144
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:29,940
protection again if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a large</font>

145
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,739
base and until a routing guy writing the

146
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,620
attack designed to affect routers I

147
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,570
think you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an attack of</font>

148
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,940
biblical proportions something that

149
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,860
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a multi-day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> event if it were</font>

150
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,540
stopped and started and would be really

151
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:46,830
hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out what the appropriate</font>

152
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:50,490
filters to put in place would be in

153
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:52,080
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of redistribution again is I don't</font>

155
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,620
it on purpose but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's easy to see how</font>

156
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:00,420
it could be done on purpose and even in

157
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,290
the case of at where it's happened by

158
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,820
accident<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's had fairly large impact on</font>

159
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:07,890
the given Network words happened and

160
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,450
when it happens to very large networks

161
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:11,820
on the ancillary networks even the

162
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:15,270
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just multihomed in many</font>

163
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:18,360
cases so the main question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have there</font>

164
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,650
again is what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done to segment and</font>

165
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,480
if any people have comments if any

166
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,530
people have looked at this it's

167
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we're thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of looking</font>

168
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,150
at for a few networks and hopefully next

169
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,469
non algorithm after we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

170
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,690
data about

another note that i have is and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

172
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,660
really have a useful suggestions for

173
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,110
this at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I see an increasing</font>

174
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,780
trend towards fewer interconnection pops

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,889

worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> people with rocket launchers</font>

179
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,900
blowing up buildings necessarily but

180
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,880
less interconnection diversity is

181
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,440
probably it doesn't enhance the

182
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,469
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were bustles of the</font>

183
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,060
infrastructure so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess the question</font>

184
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,220
is what can we do to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it</font>

185
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">economically feasible for there to be</font>

186
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,280
more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> just three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or four buildings</font>

187
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,660
that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people's connectivity go</font>

188
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,799
through don't have a good answer for

189
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,780
that but there's also something that

190
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,669
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at I think that you're</font>

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,080

194
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,800
theme but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that I think as</font>

195
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,570
a community<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should look at another</font>

196
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,280
piece that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think network engineers</font>

197
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,889
have a lot that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enhance</font>

198
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,770

<font color="#CCCCCC">really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care that much about whether the</font>

take out to do an attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

relatively hard to do an attack which

will take out authoritative servers that

that architecture and asked whether it

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,570
could be done internally how many people

people thinking of it

229
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,229
you know it how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people run multiple</font>

230
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,479
DNS servers with the same IP address

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:43,500
that visible to the public right that's

232
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:46,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">anycast so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a useful way for</font>

UDP base things of getting some

239
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,870
minor topic I'm more concerned with how

240
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:06,149
do we make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so bad guys or</font>

241
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:08,730
incompetents can't quickly devastate

242
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:12,000
your network your routing infrastructure

243
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,160
another piece I've looked at a lot of

244
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">medium-sized networks in the last six</font>

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">months a lot of them haven't touched</font>

246
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:21,240
their tac-x servers for two or three

247
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:22,830
years they have people who have root

248
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,320
access on those tacit servers it no

249
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:28,140
longer work for the company the software

250
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">has vulnerabilities granted you know</font>

251
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:33,390
there's often access control something

252
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get in but the typical history is</font>

253
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,260
that I say I can name you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

254
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,330
networks even some fairly large ones is

255
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,950
we don't trust the IT people to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> UNIX</font>

256
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,450
machines so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up some</font>

257
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,160
unix machines because we all have<font color="#E5E5E5"> UNIX</font>

258
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,020
machines at home let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tak</font>

259
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">actual on it that's easy and then once</font>

260
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,140
it's working you leave it alone I would

261
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">just encourage people to look at that</font>

262
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,449
the other thing that I would say is that

263
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,610
it also<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a good idea that not everyone</font>

264
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,990
who has enabled have root one of the

268
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:06,029
stability of networks where people have

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,490
done misconfigurations where forensic

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:13,290
was a Miss configuration and there's

272
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,990
also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> period of missing logs and that</font>

273
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,370
also it can happen when they see if it's

274
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,930
the same person you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> screwed it's</font>

275
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,339
the same person doing everything and

276
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're one person that's a problem but</font>

277
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,329
if you have 10 people doing both you

278
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:27,060
don't want to have you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some</font>

279
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:29,969
separate access control there so that's

280
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:31,140
a relatively minor<font color="#E5E5E5"> point so in terms of</font>

281
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,600
just what we talked about just to

00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,730
summarize diversity NF software is one

283
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,890
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think is interesting trying</font>

287
00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:46,290
what a second good code base next to

288
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,319
buying would be for resolving

289
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:51,060
think also devoting some thought to

290
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,509
replicating not just be bandwidth but

291
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,550
the cpu processing capacity of you know

292
00:10:54,509 --> 00:11:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ability to take actual DNS requests</font>

293
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:02,719
is important in terms of router

294
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,069
hardening<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that it would be</font>

295
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,009
interesting to study different ways of

296
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting out of and access logically I</font>

297
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:13,639
think that you know you can talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

298
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,199
there may be ways of doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> queuing of</font>

299
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,610
what can get to the control plane but I

300
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:20,359
think when you look at all the different

301
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that routers can be running</font>

302
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,329
statically or dynamically building

303
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:26,189
filter is about say this many bgp

304
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:27,508
packets at this many<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp packages in</font>

305
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,730
this interface in this in that interface

306
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:31,290
a little bit too complicated most of the

307
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,550
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've talked to are not up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

308
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,099
trying to build something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

309
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,599
complicated but I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

310
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,630
apologize for<font color="#CCCCCC"> not having pretty diagrams</font>

311
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,759
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mpls the separate routing</font>

312
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,930
tables and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability to run virtual</font>

313
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,420
networks on top of the same

314
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,729
infrastructure or even frame relay where

315
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,009
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single prefix which you</font>

316
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,750
number your control devices and your and

317
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:54,649
your routers in and then you ensure that

318
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:57,029
that traffic stays can only come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

319
00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:58,740
interfaces that are connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

320
00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:01,260
virtual network I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has some</font>

321
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,639
promise unknown right now whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

322
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,850
would work but I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'd be</font>

323
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to do some lab work on that</font>

324
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:10,980
in terms of redistribution you know the

325
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:13,800
rd question is really does segmenting

326
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,660
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP helped i think it does but i</font>

327
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't tried to actually attack any</font>

large beclan area versus not basically

330
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,870
the question is if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have five</font>

331
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,720
locations which you can control<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

332
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:30,420
run say area 0 there and you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

333
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,100
other locations in one region which are

334
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,339
fairly important but which you don't

335
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">have physical access to if you run them</font>

336
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:39,269
in a separate area and you only have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

337
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,069
or two routers that bridge them and you

338
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:43,470
only do that with summarization can you

339
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:45,149
actually limit the damage of somehow<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

340
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,120
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred thousand ralphs extra in</font>

00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:49,860
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> igt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in area 1 i suspect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer</font>

342
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,980
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes I don't know it'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be interesting</font>

343
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,019
to see I know that a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of major</font>

344
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,370
router vendors I think have resources

345
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:58,380
and have customers who are interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

346
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:01,720
answering this question

347
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:04,030
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the CPD production question</font>

348
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,430
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much what i had just some</font>

349
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:09,189
thoughts and really question of what

350
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:11,530
people do or what people have studied in

351
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,420
terms of attacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> high GPA or limiting</font>

352
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:17,230
damage that can happen when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

353
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:20,199
gets flooded and second in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of</font>

354
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:23,350
living or protecting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cpu the</font>

355
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,720
resources your<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU matters yes yeah</font>

356
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,850
there is another type of impending

357
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,400
threat that I haven't heard anyone

358
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,990
mention right now if all those things

359
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,990
can pick up the phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and call each</font>

360
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:38,320
other if we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> as some people are</font>

361
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,120
seeing those would be eventually say the

362
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,940
things running the phone network over

363
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,890
the IP network and eventually get rid of

364
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone network we won't even have</font>

365
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:51,850
that so it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> important to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think in</font>

366
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:56,220
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of logical or physical other band</font>

367
00:13:51,850 --> 00:14:01,900
channels not hopefully not just a phone

368
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:03,640
in order to recover from<font color="#E5E5E5"> disasters maybe</font>

369
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:07,060
pack a clearinghouse can set up a smoke

370
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:09,040
signal network in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bay Area's the</font>

371
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:13,060
smokes will be the smoke from pcola

372
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,740
centers get melting<font color="#E5E5E5"> down now I mean it's</font>

373
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,680
an interesting question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stayed away</font>

374
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the whole converged telephony area</font>

375
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,040
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that when you can't make</font>

376
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:25,569
your converge rotors run well against

377
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,520
you know paranoid attacks you're pretty

378
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,710
stupid to put all your telephone traffic

379
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,810
on them now there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

380
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,480
are doing that I don't think it's you

381
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,010
know but at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time you can go you</font>

382
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,820
know related which is what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,260

government in paranoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> sensenig you know</font>

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,380
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you blow up now on first or you you</font>

00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,610
know give credit problems to the people

388

393
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,989
valid concern but I think you also have

394
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,990
to look at

395
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,779
the trailer you know things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if</font>

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,500
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that you have to look</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">at how do we get beyond a sort of</font>

00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:16,029

honor the rules this isn't ipv6 related

428

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 whose only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp is ripped to</font>

431
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,920
know different different<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussions</font>

432
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:43,830
there are people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that yes</font>

433
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:46,110
that's true how does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end user</font>

434
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:48,690
distinguish an infrastructure attack

435
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:52,260
from an application attack you talked

436
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:54,210
about DNS and for the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've</font>

437
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,510
talked to they basically say the DNS is

438
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:59,720
down and we have to carefully explain to

439
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,460
them that the DNS is perfectly fine it's

440
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,970
the bits and pieces between themselves

441
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:09,089
and the DNS servers that are the problem

442
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,110
so how do you help people distinguish

443
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:11,730
the fact that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the</font>

444
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:14,909
infrastructure that's falling apart it's

445
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:17,040
not the service that the other end well

446
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,689
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to address the how do you</font>

447

<font color="#E5E5E5">get users to go beyond the hall there</font>

448
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:22,350
are many stars of my trace<font color="#E5E5E5"> valve as a</font>

449
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:24,150
diagnostic you know level of

450
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:27,300
understanding you have bible that no

451
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,680

452
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,460
up and say there are too many stores in

453
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,140
my trace without<font color="#E5E5E5"> please</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forget</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it but</font>

454
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:38,580
what we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> though stars are pretty</font>

455
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:41,280
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that but know that I</font>

456
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,199
mean it seriously your comment about DNS

457
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,800
and as I was saying it really really

458
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,930
into resolving infrastructure is why not

459
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,030
if you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> control boxes in your</font>

460
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">palms why not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just give you resolving</font>

461
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:55,770
dns so that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is local to them so</font>

462
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:57,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns under the sidestep the question</font>

463
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,590
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say it shouldn't be it should be</font>

464
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if they can get to your network</font>

465
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:03,540
they can get resolving dns<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

466
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:04,860
capability and again i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not talking</font>

467
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,909
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> average core network and</font>

468
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,459
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about people who run dial</font>

infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you've got a bunch</font>

471
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:14,460
of keys you know coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in or</font>

472
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,220
universities coming into an area we're

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,230
doing enterprise or<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-user resolving</font>

474
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,900
for their users but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to</font>

475
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">sidestep the question ok bus because i</font>

476
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,210
have no good answer for the core

477
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,969
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> which I okay thank you</font>

478
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:31,149
there are no answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> there descript the</font>

479
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:33,130
broad distribution putting your

480
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:34,799
resolving name server pretty much

481
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:38,169
everywhere it has its own set of issues

482
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,570
having to do with cache coherency which

483
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:44,080
as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell very few people are</font>

484
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,490
looking into at this point so that's it

485
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,879
that's an entirely different set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

486
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,679
problems so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like there's</font>

487
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,059
a whole lot of real good answers here

488
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:55,840
just a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting questions i</font>

489
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:57,370
guess my selfish bias is that I'm never

490
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,389
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people not run</font>

491
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:02,678
Microsoft and you know run OS is but do

492
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,090
you know that don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> allow buffer</font>

493
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:05,950
overflows and all that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not</font>

494
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,389
realistically going to happen so I look

495
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,250
at what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do to protect your</font>

496
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,600
infrastructure so that all the attack

497
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,860
traffic can get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> edge to do</font>

498
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,510
its damage you're going to have some

499
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,309
module at modulating effects in BGP

500
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,450
that's okay we understand that that's

501
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:18,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">state of the art that's what happens</font>

502
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,169
today and the internet basically models

503
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,990
along my concern is what happens when

504
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:24,640
they take our tools which is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPUs of</font>

505
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,890
our routers that actually have to make

506
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,350
the you know populate the forwarding

507
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,750
tables and remove those now to the end

508
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">user that may be just as devastating as</font>

509
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,539
something which takes up their land but

510
00:19:33,399 --> 00:19:36,070
I don't really care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that because I</font>

511
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:37,899
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix every end users left I</font>

512
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,970
just have to you know the networks that

513
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:41,199
I am dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with we just have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

514
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that the package flows through our</font>

515
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,809
network well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's why I'm looking</font>

516
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:48,279
not in the application layer primarily

517
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:54,299
other heckles comments I think we need

518
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:54,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">to move on all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font>
