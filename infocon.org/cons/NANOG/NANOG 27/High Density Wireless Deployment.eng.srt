30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,649
you get two sorts of responses on some

40
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,520

<font color="#E5E5E5">from having worked on previous events</font>

48
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:14,100
some of the cards that meanders

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,290
manufacture only support 255 max on one

50
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,859
side so clearly if you get to that

51
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,810
number the whole access point blows up

52
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:25,350

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,220
the access points are designed to

62
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,620
ameliorate that by caching the ethernet

63
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,290
frames and resending them results in

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,239

have 16 megs of ram you can only queue

00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,390
for so long the most obvious impact of

67
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,030
this is you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing greater than</font>

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">because the clients that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,359
either because it's finally given up and

77
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,510
crashed or because the users move so

78
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,070
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can get better connectivity</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> largest source of radio interference</font>

80
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:35,340
in any deployment seems to be the access

81
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,930
points themselves and not the users when

82
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,989
you have them close together because the

83
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,430
users are actually sucking down more

84
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:42,480
traffic than they're sourcing unless

85
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,350
they're running file sharing

86
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,329
applications or something from from

87
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:51,690
their wireless network if they're mostly

88
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">brett web browsing or pulling down their</font>

89
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,100
email we're watching streaming media

90
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,110
it's the access points that spend most

91
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,390
the time transmitting on and so it's the

92
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:03,780
access points<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinions end up stomping</font>

93
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:06,390
on each other site surveys and testing

94
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,790
can't entirely eliminate any problems

95
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,380
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you don't know things like</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">where all the users are going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sit</font>

97
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,030
when the meetings are out you don't know

98
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,829
what or what the performance

99
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,470
characteristics<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a room are going to</font>

100
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:25,010
be when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has an extra 200 tons of meat</font>

101
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:25,010
and water in it versus not having that

102
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,450
what do people want when they sit down

103
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,710
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a wireless network well I mean</font>

104
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,530
the basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is they want to get</font>

105
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:37,489
their work done but they want to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

106
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,929
to roam again between access points

107
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,640
because when you move around you don't

108
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:46,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">want your connections to drop you don't</font>

109
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:49,159
want to get a new IP address you

110
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,020
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be on the same subnet</font>

111
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,210
there are vendors who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving into</font>

112
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,450
this space who do things like tunnel

113
00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:00,180
between access points on different

114
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:02,010
networks some of them do extremely

115
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">strange things a lot of them look like</font>

116
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,289
gnats I think probably the ultimate

117
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,700
solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the roaming problem is</font>

118
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,380
probably the ultimate solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all</font>

119
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,710
roaming problems which is some kind of

120
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">IP mobility stack we're probably still a</font>

121
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:18,830
long way from there they want low

122
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,120
latency and loss but just to say that

123
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,969
when they do something they wanted to

124
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,500
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet network or</font>

125
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,360
any network with desirable

126
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,940
characteristics they want it to work

127
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,560
just like it does at home<font color="#E5E5E5"> because most</font>

128
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,300
people who go out and buy wireless

129
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,720
equipment and deploy it at their house

130
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,340
just plug it in and it works and they

131
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,050
have a reasonable expectation that they

132
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:47,849
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to do the same thing here</font>

133
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:50,100
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of Givens about that you can</font>

134
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:53,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">just assume when you're building one of</font>

135
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,900
these networks in the US you have 11

136
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,090
available channels three of them are not

137
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,810
overlapping on the total amount of

138
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:02,989
spectrum you have 83 megahertz

139
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:05,210
and each each of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> candles is 20 20</font>

140
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,870
megahertz<font color="#E5E5E5"> wide so you know that's how</font>

141
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:11,330
many you can stuff in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless</font>

142
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:15,110
cards with thirty mil alive TX basically

143
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,550
like the wave land have about have a

144
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,810
free space range of about a hundred

145
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,010
meters so if you have to wave land cards

146
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,960
basically you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit this entire room</font>

147
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">with one access point course it wouldn't</font>

148
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,270
work very well from the perspective of

149
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:32,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">the users but as far as coverage goes</font>

150
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:34,760
they work approximately that difference

151
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:37,099
the antennas on wireless cards are

152
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,310
actually pretty poor in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases</font>

153
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,020
they're about minus 2 DB gain but one of

154
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> observations you can make about that</font>

155
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,070
is they only perform incrementally more

156
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,740
poorly in the vertical space as they do

157
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,940
in the horizontal space and that's

158
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,940
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use to your advantage</font>

159
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:59,870
for nanog 26 which is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first of these</font>

160
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,900
events that we did last year we deployed

161
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:05,390
13 access points<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 in the main room by</font>

162
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:09,500
itself so in a relatively small hotel

163
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:12,710
bar smaller than this one we had 13

164
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:15,740
access point we used a mix of two

165
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,180
antenna types in order to get the

166
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,880
density in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have a</font>

167
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">good picture that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here in a moment but</font>

168
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,469
half the antennas are horizontally

169
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:26,330
polarized and what that did is the the

170
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,010
antennas on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> access points which in</font>

171
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,389
this case are dipoles are far less

174
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:39,050
antennas on the wireless cards so even

175
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,630
in places where we have a map coloring

176
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,130
problem and things are adjacent channels

177
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,409
the likelihood of the access points

178
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,900
interfering with each other is

179
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:51,789
significantly lower in this case we were

180
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:54,799
also able to reduce the output power on

181
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:57,710
the access points themselves which has

182
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,479
the property that the wireless cards and

183
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,638
the clients will associate with the

184
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:04,310
access point they see with a strongest

199
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,610
you're in a situation where the load can

200
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,809
actually be distributed reasonably

201
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:42,780
across all the access points so there's

202
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:47,069
a horizontal access point very<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-tech</font>

203
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:51,329
it's rotated 90 degrees from being a

vertical access point the practical

205
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:55,680
result of that actually if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font>

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it has the same radiative pattern</font>

207

00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,840
an external<font color="#CCCCCC"> antenna we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

internal antennas in the access point

and we get patterns that look like that

214
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:24,750
so all the horizontally polarized access

215
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:27,030
points basically have a footprint that

216

is rectangular and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're far less</font>

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:09,920
willing to tolerate from a user so the

291
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:13,060
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> point will disconnect a client</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> reaches a certain threshold and</font>

293
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,520
what happens is in situations where you

294
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:21,140
have marginal antennas or marginal

295
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,870
quality and all of your access points

296
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,819
are marginal from the perspective of a

297
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">client the client will associate with an</font>

299
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:33,740
and whereas if you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity</font>

300
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:36,260
to use power settings the access point

or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client simply won't hear the</font>

302
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:42,740
access points in the same situation so

303
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:44,750
clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flip-flop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on because in</font>

336

not vice versa crashes but tend to leave

340

the cascading failures so when you don't

so that access point then blows up

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,920
because it becomes overloaded so you can

watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crash go around the room and</font>

358
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,770

interoperability issues with some older

366
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:27,570
cards and this when you have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

367
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:32,730
have a broad variety of hardware and you

371
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,030
and they don't support all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

short preambles at very low bit rates

374

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like get all varieties of cards</font>

377
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,180
to working and there's some question as

378
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:59,930
to how obsolete you want to choose to

379
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:04,280

complaining and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know why it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

381
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:10,490
hard to not justify tweaking it you need

00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:12,650
real management tools for all access

383
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,680

with in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases an SNMP management</font>

389
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:35,060
of these cases you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass the</font>

vendors is that if you transmit at what

502
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,580
or you might have to significantly

503

that's going to do is sort of hinder the

actually do multicast so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your edge</font>

are doing multicast that way

559
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:09,549
so you check it on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet you can</font>

00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:58,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">person to ask on that would probably be</font>

576
00:26:52,869 --> 00:27:01,299
bill since he has most of the effort

577
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:05,738
that went into doing those on there are

578
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:08,710
actually quite cool for something that's

579
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:10,210
you know a relatively minimal scripted

580
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,729
interface they actually work a lot

581
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:16,029
better than the enterprise tools that

582
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:19,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've paid a lot of money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for isn't that</font>

583
00:27:16,029 --> 00:27:22,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually the case so a lot of the scripts</font>

584
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:24,159
were just things that I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

585
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:26,349
the fly to solve a given problem or

586
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,509
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they're not like nice</font>

587
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:30,639
polished things but yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

588
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:34,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">see a problem with making them available</font>

589
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:38,289
I might keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that steals</font>

00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:41,499
fantastic from the base station but

mean in the interest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> full disclosure</font>

593
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:48,429
we've given that vendor a fair amount of

594
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:50,499
time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to revisit</font>

595
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:54,369
with them whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they've</font>

596
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:55,389
actually solved that and if I can since

597
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:57,549
there's nobody else I had one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

00:27:55,389 --> 00:28:03,070
watching for the u.s. to Tennessee folks

599
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:06,059
um have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> found issues with people</font>

600
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:09,070
other than your frat and sorority groups

602
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:14,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">you found any widespread bad things</font>

603
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:17,150
happening with people<font color="#CCCCCC"> using the network</font>

604
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,670
sort of open mode<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess my question is</font>

605
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:21,800
coming from the sense that I get

606
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:23,630
homeland security and folks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

607
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:26,180
are out saying we need to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> lock</font>

608
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,580
down our wireless networks because they

609
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:30,830
could cause evildoers do bad things and

610
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,629
stuff like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you noticed or</font>

611
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:35,449
do you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any preparatory ability to</font>

612
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:39,650
notice a bad things happening on that

00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:41,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">network now we haven't noticed anything</font>

614
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:43,790
so far and if the homeland security

and but please this convenient because

620
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:02,510
then you lose everything that you

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:06,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">devious so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at miss people just learn how</font>

633
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,040
ever looked at such a solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you</font>

634
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,840
covered large areas with large numbers

<font color="#CCCCCC">of access points all operating on a</font>

single channel

637
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:52,950
well I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had relatively negative</font>

638
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:56,909
experiences doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> areas</font>

639
00:29:52,950 --> 00:30:01,450
one of the vendor suggested<font color="#CCCCCC"> solutions to</font>

640
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:03,130
to the crashing access point problem was

641
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:07,570
simply to put two cards in the access

642
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:12,190
point on the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel but what</font>

643
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:15,189
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that point is you have the</font>

644
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:18,130
same collision domain and all these

645
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:22,090
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are operating in ibss mode on so</font>

646
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:25,690
the access<font color="#E5E5E5"> point assumes that it</font>

647
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:30,040
actually has control of who transmits on

648
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:35,260
that channel to some extent and as a

649
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:38,290
result you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more issues with</font>

650
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:41,770

the packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are sending and how many</font>

packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> UDP for example that you could</font>

658
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:04,600
push out in one direction or the other

659
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,030
on the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel and not smash each</font>

other whereas when you have extremely

661
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,560
large packets on the other hand I mean

662

right up around<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,500 the probability of</font>

671

everybody starts to suffer and if

there's more noise on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same channel</font>

we need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> portable but I had a question</font>

682
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,439
for Joel have you given any thought to

683
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:29,270
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens if you roll into a venue</font>

684
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,760
where there is already a wireless

685
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:37,010
network deployed when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we gave when we</font>

686
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,200
did the site survey for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hotel in</font>

687
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:41,450
Atlanta we discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it's</font>

688
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,030
basically surrounded by<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 story high</font>

689
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:45,650
buildings so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean in the process of</font>

690
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:49,879
doing the site survey we discovered

691
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:53,059
about 15 wireless networks that you

692
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,490
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually hear in hotels it</font>

693
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:56,809
actually turns out not to be much

694
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:59,809
problem because these buildings are so

695
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:01,610
large and they use so much concrete that

696
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:03,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual amount of interference is</font>

697
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:06,050
small at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point where people start</font>

698
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:08,150
deploying wireless networks that cover

699
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:11,210
hotels it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get more</font>

700
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:14,570
interesting when you look at something

701
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:17,660
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> STS n network deployments that</font>

702
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:22,700
people are doing in hotels they're not

703
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:24,980
providing nearly enough address space or

704
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:29,480
network infrastructure that an event

705
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:33,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">like the IETF could just pay whatever it</font>

706
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:36,679
costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use their services for the</font>

707
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:38,120
course of the event so I think in many

708
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:40,820
cases it's going to end up being a

709
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:46,030
negotiation between whatever wireless

710
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:48,710
isp is already deployed there and the

711
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:50,330
whatever Network you have to deploy in

712
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:54,559
order to actually get reasonable service

713
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:57,649
because I mean if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font>

714
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,129
remaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> address space available in v4</font>

715
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:03,720
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount</font>

716
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:05,580
about 200,000 / 19 which might cover

717
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,520
every venue that you could conceivably

718
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:10,020
like deploy that kind of wireless in but

719
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:14,850
it wouldn't leave much left over for

720
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:16,469
anything else so it doesn't look to me

721
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:18,480
like venues are going to come up with

722
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:23,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like large amounts of address</font>

723
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:26,370
space and wireless networks in order to

724
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:28,260
just to support flash crowds so I think

725
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:31,259
the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue is negotiating with</font>

726
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:32,669
whoever's there first yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you i</font>

727
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,250
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking more of an interference issue</font>

728
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:36,600
rather than a no debating that they'd be

729
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:40,620
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle this a lot of traffic</font>

730
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:42,360
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean that goes along with it as</font>

731
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:45,989
long as it as long as there's relatively

732
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:47,970
few people<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean if the if the existing</font>

733
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:49,529
network is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there for the convenience of</font>

734
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:51,299
the hotel staff then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have</font>

735
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:54,330
relatively low traffic on it and it's

736
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">mostly just then an issue of ensuring</font>

737
00:34:54,330 --> 00:35:04,440
that you don't stomp all over it

738
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:08,669
completely but that's about all<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

739
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:11,220
think of an in that environment say hey

740
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:12,420
Louie you're gonna hate me you're going

741
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,959
to hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> me we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to take</font>

742
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:19,190
your question offline I'm sorry so thank

743
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,190
you Joe and sleep
