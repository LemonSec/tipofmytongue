00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:08,250
bad news is if you're heading to Chicago

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,960
or Minneapolis there are flight delays

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,530
of between half an hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> and an hour</font>

those who weren't here yesterday my name

is mike<font color="#E5E5E5"> hughes I and CTO of links and</font>

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,990

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,089
called euro IX and I'm just presenting

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,269
on behalf of the of the organization

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,040
here to introduce you guys to to what

15
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,629
we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you haven't been out to</font>

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,750
the right meeting recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> inferno what</font>

17
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,370
we're doing that and so what are we were

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,620
in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> brand actually an exchange</font>

19
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:51,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">association we are not an exchange point</font>

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:54,328
itself and we were formed in May 2001

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,670
and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically to further develop</font>

22
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,670
the existing bonds<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we already</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

23
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,239
at the right meetings was a working

24
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,850
group devoted to discussing issues for

25
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:07,649
European exchange points and what we

26
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,199
felt was we could actually take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one</font>

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,170
step further because we all have a lot

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,020
of shared issues common problem shared

29
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,900
pain and a lot of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not commercial</font>

30
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,009
organizations large majority of us are

31
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,110
not for profits member member<font color="#E5E5E5"> run mutual</font>

32
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,600
organizations and therefore you know we

33
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have see we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have significant</font>

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,240
amounts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> resources that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> disposable</font>

35
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,500
never have had so we are we trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,789
sort of pool our resources and that's

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,610
something that we've tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do for</font>

38
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:42,540
quite a while and euro IX was just a way

39
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:45,119
of taking that one step further there's

40
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,250
currently 24 members from all over

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">Europe and going right out towards</font>

42
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,780
Russia as well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Moscow exchange is a</font>

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,079
member we've taken three new members

44
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,880
recently in the past six months so I

45
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we have most of the exchanges in</font>

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,380
the in the UK and our involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Euro</font>

47
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,649
IX in one form or another the check

48
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,119
exchange<font color="#CCCCCC"> is joined and in their eyes</font>

49
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,530
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign because obviously the</font>

50
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,610
Czech Republic is heading towards

51
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,350
hopefully EU membership soon so

52
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:16,720
so that they're obviously came to join

53
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:18,280
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> party we provide a website and what</font>

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,200
the website does is it provides<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

55
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,090
things one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things it does is it</font>

56
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">provides resources for people that are</font>

57
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,410
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to peer in Europe about the</font>

58
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,120
different exchanges what services they

59
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,010
offer so there's a portal layer that

60
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,140
tells you about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exchanges there's</font>

61
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,440
links to each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the pages one of</font>

62
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,880
the exchanges home pages and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all the</font>

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">details are validated that are the</font>

64
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,790
ethernet that you gig private p rings or

65
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:45,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">what kind of stuff the other thing that</font>

66
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,340
we also provided resources for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ixp</font>

67
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:50,320
members themselves so we have resources

68
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,290
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what switches and what equipment</font>

69
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,260
we're using for example when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> met we</font>

70
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:59,019
maintain a database of what app platform

71
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,450
is so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can put in what software</font>

72
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,860
running what bugs<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've found so that</font>

73
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,190
again it's a way of sharing the pain

74
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:08,410
because if you actually look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the this</font>

75
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,300
the hard way that's used by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exchange</font>

76
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,920
points in Europe its motion<font color="#CCCCCC"> from three</font>

77
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,650
vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that Cisco clamp your next</font>

78
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,359
dream so you know at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> point one of</font>

79
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,220
us is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come across a problem and</font>

80
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,650
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can share it that's good because</font>

81
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,330
it means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're keeping the</font>

82
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,840
exchanges and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet in Europe</font>

83
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:28,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">oakfield a little bit more stable the</font>

84
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,640
other area<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well as obviously the</font>

85
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,200
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of regulatory stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

86
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,640
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> EU as a whole rather</font>

87
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,369
than from the individual member states

88
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,410
of the year<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so one of the things we</font>

89
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,670
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do there is is hopefully represent</font>

90
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,850
the exchange points and obviously that

91
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:46,510
participants in terms of regulatory

92
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:49,150
affairs in the EU we've got a number of

93
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,060
projects on in place and these are

94
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">shared projects to help all the members</font>

95
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,230
and what we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is again it's</font>

96
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">these areas where we do have shared pain</font>

97
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,810
or God things that we can gain from from

98
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,549
from cooperatin close cooperation one of

99
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,260
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> is network monitoring and that is</font>

100
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:07,000
writing down requirements things that

101
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,390
exchange points in thee from monitoring

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,090
tools and those kind of utilities and

103
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,190
also you know writing small amounts of

104
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,228
in-house software such as in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Perl</font>

105
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,870
scripts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> gel scripts and various</font>

106
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:21,279
simple debugging tools and we the idea

107
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,550
is we can put<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a repository</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

108
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,138
software and the various exchanges

109
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,879
if they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hack it or modify it</font>

110
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,400
they can contribute that back in as well

111
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,949
so eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CVS database</font>

112
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,258
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the various exchanges can</font>

113
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:36,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">contribute into it with the tools and</font>

114
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,669
then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing as well is going</font>

115
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,580
towards hopefully steering some of the

116
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:44,539
existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool vendors into providing</font>

117
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,310
things that are useful and aware of

118
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:50,310
complex layer two apologies with a large

119
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,569
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fee lands which there isn't</font>

120
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,680
really anything out there that does a

121
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:54,900
very good job of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the moment</font>

122
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,280
certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> from what we've seen the other</font>

123
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,190
thing we're also looking at in network

124
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,159
monitoring is how we can harness

125
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,539
existing freeware<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source tools</font>

126
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:05,879
because obviously we've got this awesome

127
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:08,310
we can hack them around to do what we

128
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,849
want that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

129
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:15,270
this happening is a group working on

130
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:17,400
their various member joining procedures

131
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,560
how people want hear what people have to

132
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,810
go through when they when they connect

133
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,310
to an exchange in Europe some people

134
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,990
said it's very complex in Europe because

135
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,030
of so many different<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations with</font>

136
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,789
so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things to do so if we</font>

137
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">can try and make that easier for people</font>

138
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:32,310
great you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know because that's good for</font>

139
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,619
us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> good for everybody in the in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

140
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,719
period community finally the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

141
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,729
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a project that's working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on security</font>

142
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:42,599
and that's not just security of the

00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:44,818
exchange message itself but<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security</font>
