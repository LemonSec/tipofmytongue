00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:55,180
holding steady at 300 since the fall of

as we have in the past obviously but

185
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:17,439
that does have an effect on us so you

186
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:20,470
will see this new registration fee going

187
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,690

always freaks me out when I have to know

192
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:34,300
it but you'll need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know when you</font>

wait until the last minute to cancel not

195
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,579
that any of you ever would think of

196
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:42,609
doing that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's no grace period</font>

197
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,079
anymore when you cancel you'll need to

198
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:49,540
pay merit a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money to cover</font>
