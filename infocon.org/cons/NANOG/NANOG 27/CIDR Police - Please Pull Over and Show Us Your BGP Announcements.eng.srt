17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,170
configure their equipment to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:56,140
aggregation so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> can people do to</font>

19
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,960
have peer<font color="#CCCCCC"> pressure they get people to do</font>

30
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,970
what's going on with the table well

31
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,470
while this was going on and this is

32
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like Google's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at his report and looking at the</font>

35
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:32,110
tart and kind of analyzing really are

36

people listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the report</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

37
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,780
we started with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with this premise</font>

38
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:40,960
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> um you know we have the weekly</font>

39
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,060
report to do the peer pressure maybe

40
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,699
people need a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more peer</font>

41
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,700
pressure oh yeah

42
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,070
so maybe people need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font>

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,080
peer pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right maybe people</font>

44
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,210
need like maybe an<font color="#CCCCCC"> email to let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

45
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">know hey what's up maybe people have no</font>

46
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:04,449
clue all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right maybe people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have no idea</font>

47
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:07,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">what a prefix is maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody is a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">even spell bgp i mean it you know make</font>

51
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,150
no assumptions send it friendly<font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

52
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:18,340
message to other people and see what the

53
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,660
response is maybe there can be some

54
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,970
differences made with the grill to the

55
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,010
table<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of some volunteer efforts</font>

56
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,959
to kind of analyze the weekly table and

57
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,989
send out an email they say hey what

58
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:31,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's up with this okay in other words</font>

59
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:33,670
can really pure a peer pressure<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

60
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,309
actually speaking up and saying hey put

61
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,929
a dent in the growth of the table<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

62
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so the technique</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the Hank and</font>

63
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,530
I did this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of volunteer time</font>

you know with a regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> job is to go</font>

66
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:51,489
through the weekly top 20 and cannot

67
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:54,340
analyze and understand how ISPs kind of

68
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:56,200
work with some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big providers is</font>

69
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,000
their natural growth and big providers

70
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,738
and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pick out and pick a few of</font>

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,049
them and send an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email message out to</font>

72
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:03,880
the top 20 and when we send it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out we</font>

73
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:06,730
actually offer assistance to say you

our statistics over the last couple of

this officially we don't miss up on the

94
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:54,740
break basically we had a reduction in

<font color="#CCCCCC">2001 we started recording what we were</font>

doing back in February 2001 you can see

97
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,460
the numbers will<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue quickly</font>

98

through and we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> named names as</font>

to the ones who basically went up in

there aggregation rather than down we

101
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:14,450
sent out 72 email 72 different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs in</font>

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,479
23 emails so far in the past seven weeks

141
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,659
eight weeks we've only received 7

142
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,669
replies only one so far out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these 23</font>

143
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:12,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">different asn have actually reduced</font>

144
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:15,389
their prefix announcements that was the

00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:24,900
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a graph we basically see over</font>

148
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:27,539
the past two<font color="#CCCCCC"> years a reduction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of about</font>

149
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,638
seven percent that our emails hopefully

150
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:32,460
maybe have caused this reduction in the

151
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,860
cider tables looking at it and one of

152
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">the graphs that we've seen in many</font>

153
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,020
different places we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that basically</font>

154
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:42,029
starting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2001 that the scrap starts</font>

155
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,849
leveling out and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know it</font>

156
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:47,069
could be first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the comm collapse</font>

157
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:48,539
but it could also be some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the efforts</font>

158
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:51,000
that we've been making in trying to

159
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:53,699
reduce the solder tables<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that was</font>

160
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the 1st half 2nd half of is also the</font>

161
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,949
leaking of leaking basically things that

162
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,229
week out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your asn that shouldn't and</font>

163
00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:03,719
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically split the ISPs into two</font>

164
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:06,060
different groups one is the Chandler

165
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:08,039
Janice where you send them something in

166
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,400
there leaking sung<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they say oh my</font>

167
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:14,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">god and they basically run out and they</font>

168
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,779
quickly correct whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems they</font>

169
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:17,159
have whereas the other group so the

170
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:18,659
Phoebe ones where they basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

171
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:19,830
have a clue and they're like a deer

172
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:21,569
stuck in headlights and they really

173
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know what's going on and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

174
00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:26,039
basically those two different models<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

175
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:29,789
ISPs so we basically call them the

176
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:31,589
friends ISPs and during 2002 we found

177
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:34,318
that basically we had 12 incidents for

178
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:36,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone with leaking IP addresses of</font>

179
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,969
1918 but since September that is

180
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:40,860
basically stopped totally it seems that

181
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:44,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone is put in their filters now and</font>

182
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:47,430
no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is anymore leaking RFC 19 19 18</font>

183
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:51,089
addresses on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand RFC 1930</font>

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> private keep coming along and it</font>

186
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,169
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how cool the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

187
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,209
how big they are it keeps happening and

188
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:01,479
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have the unallocated IP</font>

189
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:04,210
addresses

190
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:09,490
two will go quickly through five cases

191
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:12,820
in 2002 where we had a s<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5050 leaking</font>

192
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:15,280
and I a private what we thought was a

193
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,040
private asn but basically they found out

194
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,659
turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that the as50 50 if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

195
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,950
correctly<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the Pittsburgh</font>

196
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,080
supercomputer center and they're very

197
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool phul and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically made a</font>

198
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:29,020
mistake of one digit were they<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

199
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:31,150
have been using a sm64 15 slide 12 and

200
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,350
basically then the remove private aah

201
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,760
would have worked but they made a

202
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,440
mistake<font color="#CCCCCC"> and therefore as soon as they</font>

203
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,360
realize that they took the Chandler

204
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:43,020
model and said oh my god I'll quickly

205
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:46,450
fix that AAS<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1221 which is Telstra</font>

206
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,970
basically uncovered a number of cisco

207
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:52,150
iOS bugs that basically was causing

208
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:55,780
their private<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs week out even though</font>

209
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:59,050
they had the<font color="#CCCCCC"> removed private AS command</font>

210
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:02,140
listed in their iOS config and you can

211
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:06,880
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at those cisco iOS bugs offline on</font>

212
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:10,780
your own two more cases is uunet leaking

213
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,570
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS 5757 which is basically i think</font>

214
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,520
it was allocated to UMD it was allocated

215
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,740
back in 1995 I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in touch with</font>

216
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron have spoken to Richard on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

218
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,150
cases and the person who received the

219
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,070
allocation says he has it sitting on an

220
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:29,709
eight millimeter tasty can't extract it

221
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,960
so he can't show the proof Aaron<font color="#E5E5E5"> says</font>

222
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:35,320
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> without the proof we can't put</font>

223
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:37,030
it into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tables asu unit continues to</font>

224
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,200
announce it that's the situation we have

225
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:44,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">today the other one is a 1880 which is</font>

228
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,420
paperwork was lost some time in 1994

229
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,900
right says they're willing to reregister

230
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:57,969
it as a lost asn so Peter if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hear in</font>

231
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:01,500
the crowd just contact right the milk

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:04,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully reregister it for you in</font>

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:09,250
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an arrow which received IP address</font>

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,050
shows it differently and they have

239
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:24,850
various sections of that IP address

240
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:27,160

243
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,890
they've gone through all the paperwork

244
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,699
they can find it they've gone through

245
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:38,439
actual crates of paperwork so basically

246
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,170
hopefully at some point this will also

247
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:45,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">get resolved and then we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a case of</font>

248
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:47,949
the US military where basically if 568

249
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,599
has been announcing a number of prefixes

250
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,570
and we we noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that even though</font>

251
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:57,160
they're announcing it is say 130 2000 /

261
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:26,130
in and make the database a little more

262
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:31,540
correct for all us who use up filtering

263
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:33,580
and now back to Barry so so what now

264
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,319
under some Hank and I plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> on continuing</font>

00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:39,790
some email messages out but<font color="#E5E5E5"> does this</font>

266
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,620
has an effect for trying to to keep the

to keep the table growth down those will

269
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,199
have side benefits<font color="#CCCCCC"> and attempts for</font>
