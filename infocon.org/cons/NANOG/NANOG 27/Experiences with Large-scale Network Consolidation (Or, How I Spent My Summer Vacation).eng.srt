00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,540
were for doing this the approach we took

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,360
why we chose to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we did dave is</font>

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,269

28
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:36,039
do what we did basically we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

29
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:37,990
gain some efficiencies in network

<font color="#CCCCCC">we were migrating we made a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decision to</font>

00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:14,380
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the 2548 AAS because we felt that</font>

it<font color="#CCCCCC"> had some value we had to tailor the</font>

of our of the legacy allegiance network

44
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:23,650
and by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that the IBI network</font>

45
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:27,160
was well aggregated being that it was a

46
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,569
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> older than our network and it</font>

47
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,359
would have been easier to migrate their

48
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:34,630
network popped by pop whereas we were

49
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:37,269
not so well aggregated because having

50
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,250
started in the last five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years or so we</font>

51
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:41,889
weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to get large allocations</font>

52
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,769
and so we had our net blocks scattered

53
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:48,060
all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the place it posed some issues</font>

54
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:48,060
as far as consolidation

55
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:54,750
what we had traditionally seen in some

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">network consolidation was the</font>

57
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,819
integration consisted of moving the

58
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,470
smaller a s behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> the larger ass</font>

59
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:04,708
basically making the smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> a as a</font>

60
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,930
transit customer of the larger ass we

61
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,450
view that as a less risky proposition if

62
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,840
it didn't it didn't pose any real

63
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,129
significant customer downtime but<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

64
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,440
merging the two networks we could

65
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:18,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">accomplish all of our goals and do it in</font>

66
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,819
a relatively short<font color="#E5E5E5"> period of time who's</font>

67
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:23,700
obviously more risky<font color="#CCCCCC"> and required a</font>

68
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:28,730
significant amount of downtime but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it</font>

69
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:31,349
suited our knees so some considerations

70
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,709
if you ever consider doing something

71
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:39,000
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the network's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sighs we had</font>

72
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:41,519
approximately 500 routers pre-merger the

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,340
protocols that you use on your network

74
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,670
have to scale

75
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,200
and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into that a little bit but</font>

76
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,480
we encountered some scalability issues

77
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,730
along the way in a multi-vendor

78
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,579
environment you're going to encounter

79
00:03:52,730 --> 00:04:00,170
some interesting things especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

80
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:01,700
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using mpls we unconfortable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ab we</font>

81
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,069
uncovered it once we had done the

82
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,780
conversion but we we found some

83
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:10,160
interoperability issues that were nasty

84
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,590
and the routing policy can be a little

85
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,260
tricky to adapt<font color="#E5E5E5"> from one platform to</font>

86
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,850
another especially if you're still on a

87
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:21,260
learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> curve with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the with a new</font>

88
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:24,139
router and you have to ask yourself if

89
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:27,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">network consolidation makes sense given</font>

90
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,910
your specific situation it may not we we

91
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,180
were in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a unique situation in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

92
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,830
had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand-new nationwide network that</font>

93
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,320
we had just<font color="#E5E5E5"> built for allegiance prior</font>

94
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,789
to the IBI acquisition<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we felt that</font>

95
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,349
that gave us a little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

96
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:41,349
advantage in the consolidation phase

97
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,480
so I'm gonna let Dave take over at this

98
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">point</font>

99
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,800
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing we had to look at it</font>

100
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,030
was how we were going to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had to</font>

101
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,420
come up with an overall strategy

102
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,739
obviously what was important was to make

103
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,360
sure that technical people understood

104
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,650
what the business people wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> at in</font>

105
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,210
the end otherwise<font color="#CCCCCC"> you end up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with an</font>

106
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,349
integrated<font color="#CCCCCC"> network that wasn't what</font>

107
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,700
people wanted the first place eight

108
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,280
hours of<font color="#E5E5E5"> downtime that didn't accomplish</font>

109
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:09,969
anything the second thing was is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

110
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that animal milestones and goals we we</font>

111
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,600
truly tried to push it<font color="#E5E5E5"> too fast at first</font>

112
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,830
and fortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> we realized we're</font>

113
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,590
pushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it too fast before it got too</font>

114
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,359
out of hand yet scientists say we can do

115
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,359
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a month I swear to God I won't</font>

116
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">sleep how come in weekends I'll eat</font>

117
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,390
while I'm typing but it's much better to

118
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:31,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually keep your sanity then we had to</font>

119
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:35,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">put together the team a team building</font>

everybody on the same page was and

125
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,810
making sure everybody give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about was</font>

126
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:55,050
involved was interesting process but we

127
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:55,050
got through it through

128
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we put together our plan the new</font>

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,460

lap time isn't always what you need I

135
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,040
mean you have to see what does in the

everything up just put<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything back</font>

167
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:35,259
the way it was sigh have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> coffee and</font>

168
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:38,710
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> again next week and practice</font>

169
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:40,150
practice practice practice it doesn't

matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're not actually doing any</font>

171
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,349
real work just going through the motions

172
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,419
over and over again we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the</font>

173
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:48,070
feeling of okay this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly my do</font>

174
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:51,758
that night<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hey would be really nice</font>

175
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,259
here is we had somebody doing this you

176
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:59,080
catch again you catch a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mistakes</font>

177
00:07:53,259 --> 00:08:02,020
by practicing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a first time you tried it</font>

178
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,280
we try to do it one night big mistake it

179
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:07,630
was there was way too much because if

180
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">500 routers have to be touched one of</font>

181
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:11,680
them goes wrong and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you spend</font>

182
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on fixing it and now you're</font>

183
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,659
really behind so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we back that out and</font>

184
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:20,080
went back and tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in two nights</font>

185
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:22,030
first we do the legacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> ivi network which</font>

186
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,770
had more routers but was closer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

187
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:27,429
policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it was</font>

188
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:29,250
less work<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the second piece we</font>

189
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,330
would reconfigure the allegiance one

190
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,708
there's really three networks involved

191
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,149
but the third network didn't carry

192
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:37,140
traffic it was a backbone<font color="#CCCCCC"> be wrong</font>

193
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:37,140
everything on<font color="#CCCCCC"> two and</font>

194
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,640
so that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a boon if you can</font>

195
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,900
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you have ref to merge is is</font>

196
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,010
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a third network that's not</font>

197
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,400
doing anything that's wonderful because

198
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,720
you can play<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it of course not</font>

199
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:54,270
everybody can afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build another</font>

204
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,050
basically do not pay attention was

happening behind the<font color="#E5E5E5"> curtain we'll come</font>

out when we're done<font color="#CCCCCC"> that again was a</font>

207
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,449
really good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> I strongly recommend</font>

208
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,100
not letting anybody see what's happening

didn't behave exactly we expected

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,439
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that caused huge trauma but good</font>

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:36,750
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix before we integrated the</font>

218
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,310
rest of the network noon day before we

219
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,920
told everybody no more configuration

220
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:43,380
changes if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever have to do this do</font>

221
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,030
that last<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you need is to find out</font>

222
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,100
that somebody could figure something 20

223
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,730
minutes ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea how</font>

224
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,990
you're going to handle during the merger

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:55,620
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> configuration to generate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a sandy</font>

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:57,450
checked put together a perl script

227
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,470
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> that downloaded the config</font>

228
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,460
figured out what it should look like

229
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,260
after it was done and sped it back out

230
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,580
shared that with people people point out

231
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,930
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were vastly wrong with it</font>

232
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,670
things that had missed things that I've

233
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,650
gotten right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did again perl script</font>

234
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:12,280
was poorly written and still do router

235
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,600
every two seconds if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have somebody</font>

236
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,089
can script like this and you need to

237
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">make a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of configuration changes</font>

238
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:20,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i strongly recommend it it's also</font>

239
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,630
less prone to typos and human beings or

240
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:28,060
if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> negatives come at the same type</font>

241
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:29,410
of yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we backed up the router</font>

242
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,540
configurations because really the easy

243
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,740
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to back out from a massive change is</font>

244
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,969
about the whole configuration back and

245
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,700
reboot which is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we put the</font>

246
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:41,860
configurations in the first place just

247
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:43,660
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure we had a clean committal we</font>

248
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,780
then may I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention before shut off</font>

249
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:49,449
the ball appears<font color="#E5E5E5"> on both sides for the</font>

250
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,890
for the complete merger and loaded all

251
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">the configurations out in a single</font>

252
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:56,730
market rebooted that market made sure it

253
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:58,900
worked it's not the slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it didn't</font>

254
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:01,300
so we had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go back and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say what did we</font>

255
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,410
do wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do it again because we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

256
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,849
this group that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gentry janitors</font>

257
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:09,520
configs in a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes it took</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

258
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,470
in three tries<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get involved working</font>

259
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,920
but then we put the<font color="#CCCCCC"> variations on all</font>

260
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,920
the routers

261
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,700
yeah after those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was working the</font>

262
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,520
patient's out on the rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the routers</font>

263
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:24,330
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> took the big switch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Network</font>

264
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,860
off network on market by market the five

265
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,660
minutes it takes for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst case</font>

266
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,090
router to reload and everything's

267
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,760
working a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases it wasn't working</font>

268
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:35,280
but again for the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> part it worked</font>

269
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,900
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> cleanly surprisingly well expected</font>

270
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,560
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose a large number of routers to</font>

271
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,370
various stupidity and it didn't happen

272
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,050
there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of routers that were</font>

273
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">running the wrong rep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of code they did</font>

274
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:49,229
some unexpected things but for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

275
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:53,100
part everything just worked a couple

276
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:55,940
customers are issues getting the

277
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,880
different routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've heard policies</font>

278
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:01,320
talking to each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is bad when one</font>

279
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,550
thing uses this community to say don't

280
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,380
export<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the other one uses a</font>

00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,870
different community or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">bucksport tag they will leak routes</font>

283
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:13,100

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:45,280
not many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have 500 router test</font>

297
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:56,079
i'd like to go work for you but with 500

routers you will find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you are</font>

yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to mention vendor</font>

308
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,880
sometimes they don't do things the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

309
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,960
way they read the same RFC they don't

and assume that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other ones fault</font>

314
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,420
what doesn't work when they talk to each

315
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,400
other when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually sit them down</font>

316
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,569
and say hey this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken they worked</font>

00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">with us and we'll attention that later</font>

stuff up but

320
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,720
yeah it was a surprise how many things

321
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:50,639
didn't work exactly same last thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

322
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,950
want to mention real quick is I think my

323
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,000
lesson<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a policy gap I don't know if</font>

324
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,350
anybody was peering with this one we did

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">the merger I'm sure there's some people</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of misleading as much as a customer gap</font>

330
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:10,139
we had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lost their policy</font>

331
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,940
when we redid the network and<font color="#CCCCCC"> got stuck</font>

332
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:17,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the default policy which was hey this</font>

334
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,250
appearing with another writer there a

335
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,388
multi-homed did<font color="#E5E5E5"> announce the entire</font>

00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet to us because they were poorly</font>

337
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:24,990
configured and poorly configured plus

338
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:29,160
poorly configured equals really really

339
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:31,790
bad so we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn that off and deal</font>

340
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,790
with a customer

341
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:37,890
I'll give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to will for some</font>

342
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:43,920
clothes yeah we learned a lot during

343
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:46,560
this obviously nobody's perfect we

344
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,469
didn't go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this thinking we were but</font>

345
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know typos happen you move on with</font>

346
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:56,040
your life we expected some equipment to

347
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,660
fail and sure enough it did every time

348
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,469
you reload a router I think you're

349
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:04,920
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big risk we also learned that</font>

350
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:08,160
you can't plan enough we spent several

351
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:11,310
months planning this cut and for all the

352
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,780
testing we did we still uncover things

353
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:17,849
that we didn't account for and Dave

354
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,319
specifically wanted to mention from a

355
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,660
scalability point that some of these

356
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,640
problems obviously don't manifest in a

357
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,060
lab where you have you know half a dozen

358
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:29,480
or a dozen routers however on a large

359
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:33,709
network they will manifest and

360
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,710
unfortunately they manifest in bad ways

361
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:40,890
some of the company type lessons learned

362
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,250
communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> is extremely key during a</font>

363
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:46,140
process like this we probably didn't do

364
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,720
a good enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> job of notifying our peers</font>

365
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,000
and customers exactly what kind of work

366
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,460
we were doing

367
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,530
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's key going forward that</font>

368
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:56,240
if you ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> attempt something like this</font>

369
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,310
that you make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you notify your</font>

370
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,830
customers give them a really good idea

371
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,780
of what you're attempting to do and as

372
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:04,760
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as your peers and peers are a</font>

373
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:08,959
valuable resource and a valuable asset

374
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:10,400
and valuable partners I feel like we

375
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,650
probably should have given a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

376
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,980
better notice to our peers there and

377
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:18,800
also set and manage realistic

378
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:23,510
expectations both to your customers and

379
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,479
your executive management and we also

380
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:36,460
learned that an out-of-band management

381
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:39,260
network is a priceless asset hopefully

382
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:45,140
we all learned a lot of especially about

383
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:46,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">that also we also some of the things</font>

ever planning something like this is you

386
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,040
know don't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid to speak up we had</font>

387
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:57,620
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of meetings and a lot of meetings</font>

388
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:59,360
leading up to this and if somebody comes

389
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with an obscure way that this could</font>

390

break don't don't knock it down and as

391
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:08,178
you know that's too obscure I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font>

00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:09,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">you keep it clean we just discovered a</font>

393
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:11,659
lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> along the way it was it</font>

394
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:15,919
was a hellish two weeks I'll just put it

395
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:17,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way what we started with these were</font>

396
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,409
the networks that we had going into this

397
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:23,599
we had the allegiance network the old

398
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:25,759
ibi network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and are what we call our</font>

399
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,490
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> two networks which was this virgin</font>

400
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,620
network that we had and this is the

401
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,090
finished product or an approximation of

402
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,580
it this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> approximately what our</font>

403
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:38,090
network looks like today we officially

404
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:39,289
I'd say we're about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> 95% we've</font>

405
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,570
accomplished about ninety-five percent

406
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:43,250
of our consolidation at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

407
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,039
there's still some optimization

408
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,899
occurring some links going up and down

409
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,500
being disconnected<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> links coming up</font>

410
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:53,360
but this is what we're done

411
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,430
and I have a little personal slide at

412
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,639
the end I'm a long-suffering tampa bay

out to the teams that worked on this

417
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:12,620
with us this was not a two-person effort

cisco and juniper tax were very helpful

423
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,770
during this actually they were available

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:56,080
I've always been taught that for a large

430
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:59,200
operation you just never ever ever do a

431
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,659
cut over find some way to do incremental

432
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">change and and one could argue that's</font>

433
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,610
what you came to although<font color="#E5E5E5"> going from one</font>

434
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:10,120
switch 22 doesn't seem like much of a

435
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:12,550
step so my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

436
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,379
now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've gone through this there</font>

437
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,930
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been a way to engineer this</font>

438
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:20,350
more incrementally and therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> less</font>

439
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:23,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">dramatically I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if we'd had</font>

440
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:24,850
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and yeah we probably could</font>

441
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,889
have come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with some ways to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

442
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,480
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more clever about it something we</font>

443
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,180
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention was that we were under a</font>

444
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,850
timeline of about a year to have this

445
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:36,460
consolidation done so it required us to

446
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,780
take steps that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were maybe more drastic</font>

447
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,060
than we would have liked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have taken</font>

448
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,340
but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end we accomplish the goal</font>

449
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,770
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know with some with some heartache</font>

450
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,480
and headaches so yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say</font>

451
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,160
there's probably some ways we could have

452
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,640
thought of<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this maybe using</font>

453
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,500
Confederations or something like that

454
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,770
again it the way that we chose suited

455
00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:00,100
our needs and you know we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah go</font>

456
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:01,480
just add something real quick here from

457
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,800
a customer service point of view I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

458
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,960
have loved<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do an incremental change</font>

459
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,280
as an engineer the first thing I thought

460
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,320
was my<font color="#CCCCCC"> god if we do an integrand</font>

461
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,389
incremental change will get halfway done

462
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,950
and gets stuck we'll have a policy that

463
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,240
nobody wants it doesn't do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

464
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,510
we're not allowed to change for whatever

465
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,400
reason so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was very split on that</font>

466
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:23,350
but the timeline let the engineer win

467
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,490
which I usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering</font>

468
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,080
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could speak to the tools</font>

469
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,930
environment a little more you mentioned

470
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:33,460
having a perl script to<font color="#CCCCCC"> munch</font>

471
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:35,890
configurations in the larger picture

472
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,080
were you changing dns at the same time

473
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:40,540
did you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a rent a big rancid</font>

474
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,629
router DB that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you needed to change at</font>

475
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:46,480
the same time what was going on you know

476
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,730
one step<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from the routers sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font>

477
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">take part of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i handsome off</font>

478
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:54,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">today we did a lot of post-merger can</font>

479
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,940
clean up and we're still doing some of

480
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:00,220
that here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're weary numbered our</font>

481
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:01,720
entire backbone<font color="#CCCCCC"> or some of the links</font>

482
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,160
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we kept from the allegiance network</font>

483
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,750
we're on different space than what we

484
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,240
decided we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of our backbone</font>

485
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:10,150
links<font color="#CCCCCC"> number loopback addresses were</font>

486
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:13,830
changed things like that Dave you want

487
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,830
to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that were used</font>

488
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:21,540
well yeah the perl script because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

489
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:25,230
get completely hungreh we changing dns

490
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:28,230
was more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than on aux said experiment</font>

491
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else monitoring one</font>

492
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:32,010
reasons why we remembered is some of our

493
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:35,700
modern tools discover based on network

494
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:37,440
and so and based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS but also by</font>

495
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and so by putting everything on</font>

496
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same network everything</font>

497
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:44,460
automatically discovered we did have a

498
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,370
huge rancid database of configurations

499
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was where I pulled the</font>

500
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,330
configurations well half rancid half

501
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,889
homegrown tool because there was two

502
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:56,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">different networks before we got started</font>

503
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:58,049
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> had pulled from those one was</font>

504
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Pauling liver routers four times a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

505
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:02,129
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other one was blowing it more often</font>

506
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,870
that's par the reason for the huge

507
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,980
config freeze time period those make

508
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,840
sure the monitoring tools that play him

509
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,400
time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the exact current config</font>

510
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,360
make sure we weren't modifying a

511
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,870
customer out of existence

512
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,590
I guess

513
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,590
some more questions

514
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,809
yeah I think that's all I had one

515
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:22,918
question but that was the one that

516
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:26,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">Steven just as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so thanks again</font>

517
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:26,330
very much guys for that talk
