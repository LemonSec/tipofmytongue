1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:08,130
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> um this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is some joint work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DJI keys</font>

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:10,620
and I are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing on we're calling it bgp</font>

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,360
TTL security hack and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,970
something like this um here's my agenda

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,890
for this talk problem statement is it

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,689
useful where the mechanisms around it

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,740
what are the limitations around it we

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,840
can have some time for questions and

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,220
comments if you want to see these slides

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,800
for some reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can find them there</font>

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,629
so the problem statement looks like this

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,040
we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see dust against the</font>

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,660
infrastructure not starting we are

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,750
seeing dusk and<font color="#E5E5E5"> central structure in</font>

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,919
particular against port 179 and how the

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,690
question about how and why this has

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,059
happened why we know why but how it's

18
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,680
happening is is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is pretty</font>

19
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting actually it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that hard</font>

20
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,269
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do right the TCP four triples easy to</font>

21
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,480
discover the<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> require a</font>

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,829
sequence number because why because once

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,569
you get the packet<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto the RP you've</font>

24
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:02,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">accomplished your task it doesn't matter</font>

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,530
if TCP has to have to dump it at that

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,869
point so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really don't care if the</font>

27
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,430
TCP is about the segment masala or not

28
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,760
you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to overload the RP so</font>

29
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,350
that's the nature of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack you</font>

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,670
don't have to own the router you don't

31
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,949
have to do anything that really to

32
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,799
disable this so what we were looking for

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,439
is what we can do easily in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

34
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,860
near term so not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the long term s bgp</font>

35
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,419
SLV GP whatever but in the near term

36
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,750
that we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> our vendors to implement</font>

37
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,670
quickly so dance the question this is

38
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,170
there anything sort of crypto techniques

39
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,210
or otherwise that we can use to mitigate

40
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,890
these kind of attacks and the

41
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,079
observation is that TTL is still

42
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,619
relatively hard to spoof as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

43
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,059
tell and so we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know welcome</font>

44
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">with somehow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use that fact to build</font>

45
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,270
something that's useful so is this

46
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:54,030
useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so here's how it works well</font>

47
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,520
since the vast majority of ebgp bearings

48
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,420
are between adjacent<font color="#CCCCCC"> routers there are</font>

49
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,070
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop but they're mostly</font>

50
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,439
between Jason routers and especially the

51
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,889
ones who are caring about right now why

52
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,529
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just set the TTL on on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp packets</font>

53
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,169
to 255 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then just rejecting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

54
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,930
come from a TTL in the range to 50 52 to

55
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:15,049
54 the reason the reason for the range

56
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,310
is because implementations treat treat

57
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,660
treat what they do with the TTL on the

58
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">directory fully connected network</font>

59
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,850
differently to be one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

60
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,920
depending on the vendor and so if the

61
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:30,600
received TTL essence in a small range

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:33,059
let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> 254 255 and um you just</font>

63
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">accepted otherwise you discomfort that's</font>

64
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,780
the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you might</font>

65
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,670
ask why wasn't this done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

66
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">place and submit and maybe somebody out</font>

67
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,570
there knows I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer to</font>

68
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">that seems kind of obvious now of course</font>

69
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,359
given hindsight so somebody asked me

70
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:52,290
last time I talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is why not</font>

71
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,850
just set TTL equal to<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and let TTL 20</font>

72
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,560
do the discard that I will normally do

73
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,720
well the reason for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you can</font>

74
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,310
engineer it to be one when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> hits that</font>

75
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,050
router right because TP a little

76
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,350
decrement so you can engineer TTL one

77
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:08,069
the other one you can't so a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

78
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,930
on the mechanism you need a the idea

79
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:13,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">here is that we use a received path ACL</font>

80
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,660
that allow the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp packets to the RPO if</font>

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,609
and only if they have a correct so you

82
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:22,530
know source destination and TTL so in

83
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:25,530
the range<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 50 52 to 54 for the</font>

84
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly connect appears if the TTL is</font>

85
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,160
not in that range just<font color="#CCCCCC"> plant the packet</font>

86
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,798
into a low priority to you of course out

87
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that assumes you have those skus and</font>

88
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,940
just ask or just discarded so there's a

89
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,410
few assumptions in the hole in the whole

90
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,730
scheme huh one is that excuse me one is

91
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,410
that the hearings are between adjacent

92
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:47,160
routers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that one holds up okay</font>

93
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,810
um this one's a little harder it is

94
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">common practice or should become a</font>

95
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,190
practice to ingress filter that have the

96
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,799
providers loopback address as a source

97
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:57,450
of the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that probably should</font>

98
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:02,970
be best practice but it's I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

99
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:04,619
that's too widely implemented also we're

100
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,950
going to have to we need to assume abuse

101
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,390
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this mechanism if we ever get it is</font>

102
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:12,238
optional and we can do it on a prepared

103
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">Europe or for pure basis and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

104
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,459
router supports a method for classifying

105
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,570
traffic I our priorities

106
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,459
both pre robbers would have to implement

107
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,950
this to be for it to work that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

108
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,290
clear so there's a there's some there's

109
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,490
some serious limitations with this

110
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:30,940
basically it's kind of designed to

111
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:32,560
protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single op session except of</font>

112
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,090
course in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those cases where the pure is</font>

113
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,850
owned then you have to shut it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

114
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway for nothing for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop</font>

115
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,620
sessions like ibgp and<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihop ebgp</font>

116
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,450
it's less you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trade-off</font>

117
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,220
flexibility in the topology for the

118
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:52,270
power of the technique so you're kind of

119
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:55,330
doing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess beyond this we have all</font>

120
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,650
kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all kinds of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other proposals</font>

121
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,210
for how to protect the infrastructure

122
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,679
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for something we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

123
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:03,460
do quickly and cheaply and that our

124
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:08,710
vendors can implement so SP GP is one

125
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:12,159
possible go ahead anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok 44</font>

126
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:14,080
multiple you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be 4i bgb could we</font>

127
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,420
extend this so that instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of actually</font>

128
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,450
running a multihull bgp session runs

129
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,040
over GRE GRE tunnel in which case after

130
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:24,219
the thing gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> be capsulated still you</font>

131
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,020
know to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do 65 yeah you could do that the</font>

132
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,330
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other possibility</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to just</font>

133
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,979
allow some kind of configuration where

134
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:32,020
you can you know something about your

135
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,540
topology so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about the</font>

136
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,210
received the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value or the range that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

137
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">receive TTL should be in so basically</font>

138
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">that would give you some flexibility but</font>

139
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,790
at the same time it would reduce your

140
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,320
ability to protect against other kinds

141
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">of attacks because this rate in synaptic</font>

142
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,930
whereas the the GRE tunnel is there and

143
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,910
that or rather support even yeah you

144
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,730
know they do gotcha he doesn't recycle

145
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,669
but but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just scoop the GRE if</font>

146
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:00,130
you just put the TTL 255 packet inside

147
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:03,729
and there's no checking on the on the

148
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:08,200
GRE packet then it's right you haven't

149
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:10,360
solved anything yep you need you need

150
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:15,700
you need to have you need to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

151
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:17,980
one hop sign man to get it go ahead one

152
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">part that occurs is for the multi-hop</font>

153
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:23,590
you could actually have an agreement

154
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:26,050
where the router that's legitimately

155
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,520
sending it sets the TTL to some value

156
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,889
you choose

157
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,448
and by knowing your topology you know

158
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,949
what the expected value at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other end</font>

159
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,710
is yeah then that would make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a little</font>

160
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,599
harder to spoof yeah we talked about you

161
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,359
know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> capability and so forth to do</font>

162
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:42,460
this but we were kind of looking at how

163
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,180
fast can we get protection get some

164
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:49,750
relief from this mitigation go ahead um

165
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:53,080
so a few bit of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> prawn on ebgp doing</font>

166
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:56,319
having it<font color="#E5E5E5"> 255 to visit to fix before</font>

167
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,120
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> valence because on ebgp you</font>

168
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,490
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that those</font>

169
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,440
packets cannot get rerouted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an</font>

170
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:07,050
alternate times while vice versa on I

171
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:12,300
vtp you want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they can</font>

172
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:15,789
so I'm you can't if you can't really

173
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,969
narrow it down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> value that's</font>

174
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:21,068
guarantees their guarantees that the

175
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:26,770
packet is actually staying on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that link</font>

176
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:29,110
because ebgp sort of has a a nice to

177
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,539
have a link correspondent right this cup

178
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,280
is this kind of this kind of corresponds

179
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:35,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">to disabling the directly connected</font>

180
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,150
checked that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're saying that's</font>

181
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:40,900
what I'm saying and that's something

182
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,979
that has a dykon-- cost<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

183
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,400
to what you have to do is you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

184
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:47,849
make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade-off right I mean but then</font>

185
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,500
you'd need to you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really think</font>

186
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:53,250
you you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to really think about what</font>

187
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:57,639
the implications of data are and

188
00:07:53,250 --> 00:08:01,479
potentially try to achieve to keep that

189
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:03,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">tank from online right I'll just keep</font>

190
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,830
going here second<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's all I</font>

191
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:07,389
had um i already got questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

192
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:10,240
comments one thing I did want to say is

193
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:12,550
um I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we try to find a home</font>

194
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,319
for this in the ITF and IDR is not

195
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,300
taking new work items and we thought

196
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,930
domain was the right place but<font color="#CCCCCC"> ptomaine</font>

197
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,370
is kind of crumbling so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> priming our</font>

198
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,069
p sec really isn't the right place for

199
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,990
operational kind of things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we</font>

200
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:28,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have anything we really don't have</font>

201
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:30,400
a bgp ops or a global routing ops so

202
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:32,500
what so what we're doing is we're going

203
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,958
to hold a boss I just call it grow

204
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:38,620
because I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to find an acronym</font>

205
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,569
that was kind of cute but this will be

206
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,909
on a tooth

207
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:44,370
I TF weekend please if you have input

208
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:45,719
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this come on and help us out see if</font>

209
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can make something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recent a lot of it</font>

210
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,860
that's a laugh
