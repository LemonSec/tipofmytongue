00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,859
otdr anybody have a clue what that means

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:11,460
it's not optical time domain

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:15,870
reflectometer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay not that one this is</font>

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,369
operational testing of DNS and the talk

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,380
a little bit about the testbed that

6
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,509
we've been running and some of the

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,349
focuses and then look at infrastructure

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:33,630
pieces and why<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I should charge</font>

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:36,020
my battery if it was my battery i would

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,020
charge it

11
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:55,460
and now the microphones aren't working

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay this is actually to check and make</font>

13
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,270
sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're still awake and you're</font>

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,900
still inside this dark cavernous room

15
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:05,420
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> outside so anyway the sad</font>

16
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:08,869
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that this won't take 20</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes</font>

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,880
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might actually get out early so</font>

18
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:15,080
page up and page down that would be

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,470
Paige down<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay fun though they have the</font>

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:22,520
same three letters to start them ipv4

21
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:26,300
and ipv6 are not the same protocol you

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:28,610
hadn't noticed that they are different

23
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough that you actually have to look at</font>

24
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,280
how you're going to deploy them most

25
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:35,570
people that have experienced v6 look at

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,369
this may say we really don't want to

27
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:42,619
mingle this with our v4 stuff it gets

28
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:46,220
confusing the most obvious thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

29
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:47,539
v6 has larger addresses from an

30
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">operations and from an end-user</font>

31
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:53,600
perspective this I don't know if too

32
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:57,080
many people except for Andrew was just

33
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,140
yawning and policy back there who can

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:03,560
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> pneumonic Lee an ipv6 address</font>

35
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:09,160
they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> large he hates it too</font>

37
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,090
most people can remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 32-bit</font>

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:17,090
address if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was to ask you what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP</font>

40
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:26,030
was you could probably spit back the you

00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,709
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that IP was designed around</font>

43
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,530
the fact that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have address</font>

44
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:34,790
literals so a friend of mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up</font>

45
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,650
with this phrase a couple of years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that said there are no urgent DNS</font>

47
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:42,530

<font color="#E5E5E5">without the dns case of ipv6 address</font>

49
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,690
literals become problematic you can't

50
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,610
remember them so you need some mechanism

51
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,730
for doing name to address resolution to

work all the time criticality of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

protocol itself presumes ipv4 and a lot

58
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:13,590
of its design the there's this thing

called<font color="#CCCCCC"> a priming query when you don't</font>

get all that information back or you

65
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:32,010
send all that information in a single

68
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:44,730
sizes now in ipv4 in general it seems to

69
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">be much much harder to do other than</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually I'm borrowing this from a guy</font>

the routing infrastructure is rebuilding

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">question we asked ourselves at least as</font>

00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:29,550
the code stable and actually both i

invert those is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the specs table I talked</font>

with Tony pain and even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though there's</font>

85
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,479
still a fair amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of discussion on the</font>

protocol development lists on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF</font>

88
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,030
couple of reasonable sets of changes

89
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:53,669
supposedly the code that<font color="#E5E5E5"> implements that</font>

90
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:59,309
is that stable well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns implementers</font>

91
00:04:53,669 --> 00:05:01,169
that I've talked to have made was but

92
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,110
they bent over backwards to accommodate

93
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:07,700
the changes in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

94
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:11,140
support for ipv6 as the ITF has made

95
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,039
has had difficulty making up its mind

96
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,110
but they're pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good they've done</font>

97
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,170
pretty well at that then are there going

98
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,490
to be infrastructure issues we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

99
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,170
stuff that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> out here that supposedly</font>

100
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,840
works we've got operating systems that

have v6 we've got DNS stuff in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

is this going to work it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

103
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:32,930

<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago seemed actually it's more than</font>

which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to talk about a lot</font>

00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,790
today after a couple of years of closed

117
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,870
operation I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> around and briefly</font>

118
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,640
talked about the fact that you're

opening us up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who wanted to</font>

reasonably large number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds</font>

122
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,960

take registrations for ipv6 for those

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,539
particular sets of<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds and the route</font>

125
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,140
will run this you can find some<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

information<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that particular URL</font>

ipv6 resource records can be added to

nearly all the deployed<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS node as far</font>

130
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:49,250
as the code bases goes you can't put

I was told right before<font color="#CCCCCC"> lunch that ultra</font>

133
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:59,240
does have the support but you have to

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,940
ask nicely so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get it in</font>

JP and I can is waffling looking for

146
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,219
guidance some of this is that the

147
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,180
registry code doesn't have all the

148
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,730
capability and support<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that stuff</font>

149
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,610
yet they've known about it for a while

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:14,280
particular deals with the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

Google's stack which one do you pick

163
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:36,349
that's question

you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the lowest or the smallest</font>

can get quite large they can be large

179
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,290
enough particularly if you start adding

180
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,550
some other some of the other capability

181
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:31,069
where you get UDP fragmentation on 4k

182
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:32,870
packets and larger and sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

188
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,660
retransmit with TCP in this case the DNS

traffic profile starts to look an awful

190
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,250
lot like streaming content send a couple

architectural design choices is that you

00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:13,760
get a block of addresses from all of

196
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,380
your up streams and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font>

the source address selection for

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:36,459

the air

204
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:45,100
as far as infrastructure goes these are

205
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:48,850
bad things equipment vendors in general

206
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:50,020
work on razor thin margins and for

207

about gate count the fewer transistors

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,320
they have to put on the cheaper they can

212
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,600
make it if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were functions they have</font>

213
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,500
to implement the quicker to market and

214
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:12,070
so you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people who</font>

216
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,760
they can solve eighty percent of the

217
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:20,620
problem they can they can support IP

218
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:23,050
packets nap and run everything through

219
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,240
port 80 they'll drop support for pretty

220
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,490
much everything else so they think

221
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,270
locally these are local optimizations

222
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:34,090
which in the case of a v6 world really

<font color="#E5E5E5">seriously impact things so we see things</font>

floor<font color="#CCCCCC"> so UDP fragmentation doesn't work</font>

229
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:54,190
even in a v4 arena so I said I'm not

234
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:07,660
like DNS proxies which don't necessarily

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,180
understand some of the new resource

236

record types Suzanne touched a little

237
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,040
bit on some of the load balancers and

238
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,290
some of these presumptions they make

239
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,569
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the earlier layer two fabrics</font>

240

that you saw at exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> points had some</font>

interesting issues dealing with the size

the assumptions on Mac tables of the cam

the same and then if like ave you're

288
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,329
going to put a caching server and every

one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your pops that all of your</font>

292
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:45,029
up to speed<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the winner here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

293
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,099
for ipv6 and particularly with the

294
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:50,700
context of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS most of the issues</font>

295
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:54,589
appear to be known we've been hammering

296
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:57,279
on this for a little over half a decade

297
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:59,350
specifications are mostly stable

298
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,350
and at least the reference

299
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:07,389
implementation of mind it's becoming

300
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:08,980
fast enough to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually useful on the</font>

301
00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:11,620
political side there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a draft</font>

302
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,470
recommendation that is being circulated

303
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:19,110
for the powers that be to formally

304
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:22,660
augment the roots with ipv6 transport ie

305
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:25,749
eventually we will see the hints file

306
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:27,850
changing and having ipv6 records show up

307
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:32,230
in there and many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds are</font>

308
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:36,279
already running ipv6 enabled servers but

309
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:38,350
there's this gap this is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

310
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:40,689
poor taste given the train accidents and

311
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">the london underground but there's</font>

312
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:45,339
extent there's still a pretty big gap

313
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,999
here registration software if people

314
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:52,269
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this the registrar's cannot</font>

315
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:54,430
support it generally even though they've

316
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:58,360
had it on their development profile for

317
00:15:54,430 --> 00:16:00,579
a while the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS evolution is embraced</font>

318
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,430
and accommodated ipv6 so if you want

319
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:06,040
bind<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do v6 it's a no-brainer it'll do</font>

320
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:09,699
it it's been capable of doing most of

321
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:13,170
this for years however the deployed

322
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:17,758
infrastructure is not friendly to ipv6

323
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:20,829
and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've what you'll find is that</font>

324
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,680
for a variety of reasons you're either

325
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:25,269
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing ipv4 in the fast cap</font>

326
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have people paying really good</font>

327
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:32,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">money for this and then some academic</font>

328
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:37,110
it's going to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and say I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

329
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,099
be 6 i'm going to say v6 slow path

330
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">dual-stack it's going to impact my</font>

331
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,000
production stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

332
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:47,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">this on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a separate box that's more capex</font>

333
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,379
and more objects so in the case of

334
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,829
people who are wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS and to</font>

335
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:56,649
do it over ipv6 the availability of the

336
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:59,469
service will be sporadic it will appear

337
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:02,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">that way this is generally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font>

338
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,980
local optimizations for IP version 4

339
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:08,730
generally in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last hundred meters and</font>

340
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:12,299
so as you contemplate v6

341
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,770
you got to go look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the entire path to</font>

342
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:17,099
make sure that those kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of landmines</font>

343
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,839
are eradicated if you want to get you

344
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:21,569
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to satisfy the people who want v6</font>

345
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,799
you know care about v6 you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have</font>

346
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:25,349
been paying attention you should have

347
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:30,960
been out drinking or something so

348
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:37,260
questions the airport closes at three

349
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:46,160
o'clock no questions no<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments I told</font>

350
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:46,160
you lies<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>
