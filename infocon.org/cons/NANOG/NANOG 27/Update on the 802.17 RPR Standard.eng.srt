00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,610
home because I come from Canada and it's

20

guys a quick update on what things look

21
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,420
like in terms of the standard progress

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,329
and how the actual protocol is emerging

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,980
in terms of how does it compare to the

24
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">srp protocol which is a Cisco</font>

25
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,718
proprietary protocol and give you guys

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">an idea what it looks like our people</font>

the room really familiar again not too

29
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:10,589
many so a brief overview here what is a

30
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,298
resilient Packard ring it's a layer 2

31
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,310
architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so what we're</font>

32
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,130
talking about here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a layer 2 protocol</font>

33
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,740
that looks a lot like<font color="#CCCCCC"> fddi but it's not</font>

34
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,110
a PDI and it doesn't use tokens to

35
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,689
bi-directional rings also very similar

36
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,610
to sonnet BLS our apology the

37
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,250
fundamental<font color="#E5E5E5"> differences here are both</font>

38
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,250
rings carry data at the same time and it

39
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,450
uses a property called spatial reuse

40
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,210
spatial we use is very unique in the

41
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,770
fact that when a packet arrives at its

42
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,740
destination say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going from A to B</font>

43
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,199

44
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,960
stripping so they bandwidth between<font color="#CCCCCC"> dcd</font>

the resilient packet ring are tremendous

67
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,750
develop a new layer to protocol basis

68
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,239
basically a new resilient Packard ring

69

protocol a new layer to Mac protocol as

break it down right so physical layer

dot 17 supports all the way down to OC 3

86

whereas SRP only goes down to OC 12

level right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now there are no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet</font>

00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:50,050
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of the extended ring control</font>

149
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,250
field you got another TTL field and all

150
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,740
of these fields here are used for

151
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,949
bridges so right now the bridging is a

152
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,509
real big area in dot 17 its appendix e

153
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:59,830
and the standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> the standard sort of</font>

154
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:02,469
work in progress it hasn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

155
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:05,139
published on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website yet all of</font>

156
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:07,449
these fields are basically specifically

157
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:09,009
for bridging and if you know in order to

158
00:06:07,449 --> 00:06:11,379
get into details these are with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

159
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:13,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">its to beyond</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the scope but that's</font>

160
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:16,029
basically what that fields use for so we

161
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,128
look at bandwidth control<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font>

162
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:20,860
essentially the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot 17 fairness</font>

163
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:23,590
algorithm is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> srp like in the fact</font>

164
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,139
that it supports global fairness meaning

165
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,960
every node on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ring gets an equal</font>

166
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:31,240
share of the bandwidth on the ring the

167
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,029
cool thing about 17 that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

168
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,860
improvement is the weighted fairness so

169
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:38,169
this allows some nodes on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ring to</font>

170
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,990
have more bandwidth and other nodes on

171
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:41,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ring</font>

172
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,070
so if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> typical access taught</font>

173
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,380
scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> and access nodes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feeding into a</font>

auto topology discovery it's because God

182
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,250
17 supports two types of protection

183
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,570
modes there's either steering or

184
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,910
wrapping that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a bit about in a</font>

minute it also supports extended

186
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:19,580
topology frame so you can basically have

187
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the nodes on the ring discover each</font>

support jumbo frames or what have you

190
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,250
where this feels going to be very useful

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,800
protection switching to modes are

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,360
supported in<font color="#CCCCCC"> dodge 17 steering and</font>

207
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,910
wrapping the default mode is steering

208
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright essentially the fundamental</font>

209
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,390
difference is that when you support

210
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:10,580
steering you only need two nodes to do a

211
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,680
protection switz very similar to sonic

212
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,359
the fu knows you have a fiber fail in

213
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,100
the middle they both detect the loss of

214
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the laser signal what have you and then</font>

215
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,070
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just immediately wrapped around the</font>

216
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,960
failure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> send the package going back</font>

217
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,870
the other way they don't worry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

218
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,239
optimal ways to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to shift the</font>

219
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,700
packets they basically reroutes

220
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,470
ultimately after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the route so you wrap</font>

221
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,380
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you steer is what it's called</font>

222
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,580
me now then there's the steering side of

223
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,429
things which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that whenever you have a</font>

224
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">failure you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically get feedback</font>

225
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,370
messages from other nodes on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ring</font>

226
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,829
and determine the most optimal

227
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,710
directions before you start actually

228
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,240
steering the traffic potential

229
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,530
disadvantage there in some scenarios is

230
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,730
that you can have more packet loss

231
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,750
compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> steering however in the</font>

232
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,880
the bottom there I've mentioned a

233
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,490
steering supports Assad something sports

234
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,630
a strict mode so in some situations you

235
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get miss ordering of</font>

236
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,199
packets when you're wrapping and

237
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,670
unwrapping all right and so some

238
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:05,769
application protocols require you know

239
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:08,740
no reordering or duplication so that's

240
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:10,990
where the steering and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> use of the</font>

241
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,220
strict mode may come into play these are

242
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,050
the sort of discussions that are

243
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,260
happening right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now in the standards</font>

244
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,160
group terms of other stuff there's a

00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,110
operations administration and

246
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,510

layer to echo response messages used for

248
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,510

layer two things between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> notes and</font>

255
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:43,389
bridging is also supported is full

is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sort of summary slide of all</font>

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,720
the stuff have been talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you</font>

00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:52,839
guys just for reference all right now

260
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,269
the in terms of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> timeline for the</font>

261
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:58,329
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group we just got out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> January</font>

262
00:09:55,269 --> 00:10:01,449
2003 we did a working group ballot on

263
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:04,239
draft 2.0 and essentially was

264
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:07,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">fifty-three percent approval you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 75</font>

265
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent approval or even more preferably</font>

266
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,959
in order to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to what's called the</font>

267
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:12,730
sponsor ballot and then after the

268
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,819
sponsor ballot you essentially go into

269
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,470
the IPP<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reb com review process where the</font>

270
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:19,300
standard sort of gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> rubber-stamped</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

271
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,260
that's it so the current view right now

272
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,469
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were twelve hundred</font>

273
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,699
comments in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first standard so it's</font>

274
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to take a while to results of</font>

275
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:28,240
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments but two dot one is coming</font>

276
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,860
out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> March there's going to be another</font>

277
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,449

278
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,980
meetings in april may and june and the

279
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:34,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically going to do this comment</font>

280
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,510
resolution process and right now we're

281
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:39,519
targeting july probably there's a

282
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,260
realistic goal for getting all the

283
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,029
comment resolutions completed and

284
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,939
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a really good you know</font>

285
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:47,529
eighty or ninety percent approval on the

286
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,199
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group ballot and so therefore</font>

287
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,360
sponsored ballot in September and then

288
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:56,469
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a final standard in December</font>

289
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">timeframe so final thoughts on this I</font>

290
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:02,829
think you know you guys maybe start

291
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:03,620
taking a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the features of dot 17</font>

292
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,060
and

293
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,470
what resilient packet rings offers your

think you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start seeing</font>

298
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:18,140
things roll out from vendors probably in

land does our PR have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

319
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:19,250
mechanism to notify l3 that de noticed

and taking off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> line it's a good</font>

321
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:23,089
question actually it's one of the key

322
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,979
what you I'm calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> I call this</font>

323
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:27,650
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically layer to convergence</font>

324
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,839
so problem statement is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if a non</font>

325
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:31,220
adjacent node fails you have to

326
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,160
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> rely on layer 3 routing</font>

327
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,750
mechanisms in order to realize a notice

328
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,140
failed then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yuri converge which is</font>

329
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,279
crappy for voice networks right big time

330
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,170
so right now in the standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

331
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:45,830
nothing specifically that is actually

332
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:48,800
dealing with that however there is some

333
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:51,140
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> in using those tlv those tlv</font>

334
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,729
functions in order to address that issue

335
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,490
essentially what you need is a keepalive

336
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:59,270
mechanism that operates on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ring a</font>

337
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:01,610
lot faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the actual layer 3 and</font>

338
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:04,640
mechanism so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen anything</font>

339
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:07,130
specific in the actual standard although

340
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is something I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ETF will</font>

address an IP / RP are working group

342
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,670
hopefully that answered a question

343
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,949
so I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen any discussion</font>

344
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,290
specifically at l2 because these guys in

345
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,910
802 that 17 like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a layer 3 guy</font>

346
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,980
myself from an idea you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys</font>

347
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:27,140
are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're just starting the</font>

348
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,029
liaison work together with these I of

349
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:31,580
the IETF felt so they're they're really

350
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:33,640
relying on ITF to solve that problem

351
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,470
because there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of people</font>

352
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,870
layer 3 heads that come to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Triple E</font>

353
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,600
and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer 3 problems which is</font>

354
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely a problem anyway that's a</font>

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,450
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point and it's a it's got to be</font>

356
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:52,580
addressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think it will be</font>

357
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:54,440
addressed in IETF um it's a fair amount

358
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,260
of packet ring work that was done<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

359
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,330
20 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago in their buds and I</font>

360
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember hearing a talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost exactly</font>

361
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:04,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">20 years ago actually it's more like 23</font>

362
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,290
from a professor in Maryland who had

363
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,449
this idea of having packets go both

364
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,160
directions and generally doing partial

365
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:13,760
occupancy so you get more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

366
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,319
packet of flying at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time that adds</font>

367
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the complexity of the mechanism a</font>

368
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,100
fair amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> where is the idea of a basic</font>

369
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:20,930
ring is whoever puts it in as one that

370
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,250
takes it off and so I'm wondering

371
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,410
whether there's any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of analysis</font>

372
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,960
that says we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this extra mechanism</font>

373
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:29,420
what kind of benefited actually accrues

374
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:32,589
to the overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> system and practical</font>

375
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:35,180
benefit some of the practical benefit of

376
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:37,760
the mechanism of stripping the pockets

377
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,260
off early yeah that and anything else

378
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,630
beyond the work that was done<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years</font>

379
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:45,680
ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I'm not I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean 20 years ago</font>

380
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:47,810
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know one time so I if I said but I</font>

381
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,069
mean I mean maybe if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could recreate</font>

382
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,650
your question and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and understand</font>

383
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,420
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I'm wondering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how this work</font>

384
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:56,240
improves on stuff that's been around and

385
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,650
solid for a long time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

386
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,839
sounding as if it's a lot more

387
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,760
complicated and that's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> a concern</font>

388
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,300
for stuff that's supposed to be real

389
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">fast yeah so is this stuff more</font>

390
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,810
complicated than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the stuff</font>

391
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,849
we've done in the past I mean I've given

392
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,560
a very quick update you know you can

393
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,390
read to the standard yourself and you

394
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,410
realize it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as complex as maybe it</font>

395
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:20,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">appears because I throwing a lot of</font>

396
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:22,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff out the bandwidth improvements of</font>

the resilient activating protocol over

00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,929
sonet and ftdi alone

399
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:30,600
is the justification for this protocol

400
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:33,629
big time on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're retaining</font>

401

all of the benefits resiliency benefits

00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:37,410
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had and so on in terms of the</font>

403

protection switching and the complexity

404
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,509
that is in the silicon in order to

405
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:43,799
implement this I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> this has been</font>

406
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:46,619
implemented<font color="#CCCCCC"> for three years now by many</font>

407
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:48,809

Dave's comment you still have to do

<font color="#E5E5E5">start source stripping for multicast in</font>
