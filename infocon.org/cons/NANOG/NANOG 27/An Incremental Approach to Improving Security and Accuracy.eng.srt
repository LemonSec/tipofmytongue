their names here for a long for some

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,509
time now we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had security concerns</font>

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,250
about BGP that updates are not

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,350
can happen usually do happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there</font>

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,350
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> papers and talks up on the</font>

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,750
subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also of course that the past</font>

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,039
attributes with each update are not

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,948
going to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it either and this is a</font>

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,390
source of different updates and I

14
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:37,160
probably don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to go into any more</font>

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,899
detail than this not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this audience</font>

16
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,709
another issue would be repeat that is

17
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:46,710
hides information and frequently we need

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,329
a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of checking whether people are</font>

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,120
abiding by holding that they should be

20
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:54,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">abiding by when we get there they're bgp</font>

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,209
announcements and also when something's

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,829
going wrong all we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go by is the</font>

23
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">bgp data we are seeing at our own</font>

24
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,820

25
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:07,380
seen and what the source of the problem

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,820
could have been and so there isn't some

27
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,530
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need a richer</font>

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,539
channel to convey some of the

29
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,420
information that bgp is hiding along the

30
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,759
way but only get it when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is needed</font>

31
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,640
not not continually flooded otherwise of

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,740
course we lose all the scaling benefits

33
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">also when things go wrong we need survey</font>

34
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,060
