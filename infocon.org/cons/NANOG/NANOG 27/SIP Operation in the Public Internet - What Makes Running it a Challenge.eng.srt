00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:07,048
thank you again i miss Estella torque

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:13,980
and i'll be sharing our operational

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:18,660
experience with you today so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am at</font>

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,789
first just as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reminder again sip</font>

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,090
stands<font color="#E5E5E5"> for session initiation protocol</font>

6
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:27,840
it's the signaling protocol designed by

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,599
IDF<font color="#E5E5E5"> primarily for voice over IP but this</font>

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,559
enough generality in mind so that it can

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,660
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used for other applications to some</font>

10
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:38,968
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently deployed candidates are</font>

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:44,190
instant messaging and presence there

12
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:47,039
maybe possibly more now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will tell you</font>

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,730
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what experience we have had at</font>

14
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,969
the episode of org side which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:57,839
non-profit public subside where people

16
00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:00,870
can get sip accounts and use them<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will</font>

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,019
share<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you which things are known to</font>

18
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:09,570
work today and i will spend most of my

19
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:13,229
time claiming and identifying things

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:17,039
which are proven not to work today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

21
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:19,170
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> also tell you what dirty practices</font>

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,610
we used to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all these problems</font>

23
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:26,869
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are still having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what do we</font>

24
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,579
have today is a site where anybody can

25
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:32,640
subscribe get they the count like

26
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,240
it icq yahoo you just pick the first

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,189
name and<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless it's already gone and</font>

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,798
then you can use whichever sip software

29
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:44,070
you have typically I don't want to

30
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,869
promote in a specific vendor but just to

31
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,419
give you a picture of what happens today

32
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,549
typically use people use windows

33
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,680
messenger because it's free and it has

34
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,860
some editing applications like<font color="#CCCCCC"> audio</font>

35
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instant messaging and once they</font>

36
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,119
have the name that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use our</font>

37
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:04,770
signaling server to use the application

38
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:08,280
and that's basically it it's very very

39
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,250
simple service now in addition to the

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,610
public services

41
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:16,460
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> also some additional services</font>

42
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:19,070
for privileged users like myself and

43
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:22,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">anyone else who works with subdued org</font>

44
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:25,160
its termination of calls to pstn

45
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,560
exploits mail which is a very convenient

46
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,320
thing I mean I like getting my voicemail

47
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,240
messages better by email your then

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:36,260
calling back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Europe and having a</font>

49
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,750
conversation with an IVR I mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

50
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:42,679
painless thing so I really appreciated

51
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:45,620
services the good thing is we already

52
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,320
have a have our own sip server which is

53
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,320
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet it's issued</font>

55
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:57,829
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> torture people can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play with it and</font>

56
00:02:53,510 --> 00:03:01,549
it works and the services are really

57
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:04,430
becoming are being used today so it's no

58
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:07,489
more freaks and people who use the

59
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:11,600
side we see people<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the whole globe</font>

60
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:15,080
who get accounts use them actively as I

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,090
said most of us windows messenger which

62
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,750
release was actually the triggering

things work today<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the basic basic</font>

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,100
voice over IP services do work and the

much better than for PSP n because with

90
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:43,830
use voice over IP are aware of they need

00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:47,069
some bandwidth for it they cannot use

92
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,389
just dial up our users are people who

93
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:52,469
have broadband access and we have done

94
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,360
measurements all the users who are

95
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:56,939
contacting our side and we were

96
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,449
surprised to see there was absolutely no

00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:04,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">pipette loss</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and levels around with time</font>

00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:09,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">then I of mostly up to 150 milliseconds</font>

99
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:11,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">and almost ever below 200 milliseconds</font>

100
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:15,539
and that's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> pleasant for voice</font>

101
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:18,629
over IP users and you have to realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Darrell in all parts of go so it's</font>

103
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:25,009
fairly good in my opinion at a good news

104
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,830
is sip interoperability is a

105
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:33,060
well-established today I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> NOT claiming</font>

106
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:35,849
that please don't understand it if I

107
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,039
told<font color="#E5E5E5"> every seed products you see would</font>

108
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:41,490
work that that would be far away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

109
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:43,169
the proof but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go shopping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

110
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,199
know which products you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

111
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:48,240
looking at an hour a day the good news

112
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,849
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> are already established products</font>

113
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,949
which have definitely which will work

114
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:55,740
with other products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and interoperation</font>

115
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:58,110
is simply good enough but you need to

116
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,819
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is two other things to other</font>

117
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,569
the implementations which are not

118
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:05,219
perfect I admit<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fortunately we are</font>

119
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:08,129
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interpret with other</font>

120
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:11,490
technologies to there is a already

121
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:16,919
established market on devices which I'll

122
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:20,039
interoperation to pstn we have gateways

123
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:23,639
to other instant messaging products and

124
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:26,789
protocols like jabber jabber commercial

125
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:30,569
products for sizing the 8310<font color="#E5E5E5"> p three</font>

126
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:32,909
networks so that's all quite quiet nice

127
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:35,550
state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the industry i was not actually</font>

128
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:38,550
hoping the seeds of soon

129
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">some nightmares the biggest one is</font>

130
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,710
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> an axe that's the most</font>

131
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,350
frequently asked question as you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

132
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:49,229
our helpline every day I'm behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

133
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:53,640
net in case the user knows that but he's

134
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:56,850
helped me out the other thing which

135
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:01,110
makes me still quite more it is reliable

136
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:05,280
at it and I today use voice over IP I

137
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:09,360
use my cell phone I tried to avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> pstn</font>

138
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,150
well reliability of voice over IP is the

139
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,940
reason why I still have a pstn phone in

140
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:17,820
my corner see I simply do not want to

141
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,060
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to depend on voice over IP s and i</font>

142
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:23,210
will give you some numbers on that

143
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:26,070
scalability is yet another concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

144
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:29,580
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that devices are not too bad today</font>

145
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:31,650
when dealing with scalability issues we

146
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,979
have done good work on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and we can</font>

147
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:37,530
do this pretty heavy load or this much

148
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,870
worse is scalability of administrators

149
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:42,960
indeed I mean if you deployed too many

150
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:45,330
boxes or if your routing application

151
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,140
like routing policy becomes too complex

152
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:51,650
things will become very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

153

manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you will not suffer from</font>

154
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:57,630
lack of CPU cycles or memory but you

155
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:59,870
will suffer from wipe<font color="#E5E5E5"> of administrators</font>

156
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:04,680
and let's say that's a very dramatic

157
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:08,420
issue but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is expensive too so that's</font>

158
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:11,730
my primary free technical concerns max

159
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:15,750
reliability and administrators caliber

160
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:18,000
with it manageability and there's

161
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,910
another non technical concerns today too

162
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,440
and devices are still very expanding

163
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,080
that is indeed<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second most</font>

164
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:27,150
frequently asked questions thank you for

very widely used actually have learned

we don't know how big<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is</font>

the probe Amish it's definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font>

194
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:59,910
enough the problem is that is a

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,440
very dynamic at Pacific<font color="#E5E5E5"> locations not</font>

196
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:07,920
very dynamic and to accommodate their

197
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:11,370
demand for dynamics today they<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise</font>

198
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,349
IP addresses port numbers and payload

199
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:17,550
and that this would makes things break

200
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:19,589
once the pale gets over at the addresses

201
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,140
are no longer valid and<font color="#E5E5E5"> signaling can</font>

202
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:24,029
never completely safe flight so there is

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">peace today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a lot of</font>

205

how to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and I would love</font>

skipping this option in the rest of my

some hats how to deal with natural

and sadly none of them is perfect all of

216
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:05,839
them require some additional support

217
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:10,209
children and devices or in hats and none

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them is without some deficiencies</font>

219
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:17,319
mostly each of them is better or worse

00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:20,089
than the other one in certain scenarios

00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:07,609
of what all the message to take and give

maybe you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are lost alg Scandinavian be</font>

done has the great advantage that it

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,130
works even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do not own the maps</font>

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:44,329
I think taught to be method by ninety

may correct me that current reliable the

not extremely difficult to implement it

292
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,379

makes replication of data you have like

294
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:15,230
current business location and it takes

295
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:17,439
the ability to force clients<font color="#CCCCCC"> who you see</font>

296
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:20,239
you've ridden be backup infrastructure

297
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:23,299
well the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> part is reason I know how</font>

298
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:25,910
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what makes me however there</font>

299
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:27,799
is a very practical problem with the

300
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,410
other part which is my pink wine to use

301
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:33,679
the backup infrastructure what is that

302
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:36,649
well as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very practical most</font>

303
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:40,249
current phones are broken and they are

304
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:42,499
not able to use the mechanism defined

305
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:45,649
and substandard which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> VN ss-sorry</font>

306
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:48,319
what happens is the phone boot up to

307
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:50,869
learn IP address of the server and look

308
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:53,959
at it until you turn them off and turn

309
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:57,019
them on again so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes extra things</font>

310
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:59,569
very difficult we have no easy ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

311
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:03,829
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients use a backup infrastructure</font>

312
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:06,410
if the primary<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is not available we</font>

313
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:10,459
has been playing this many dirty dirty

314
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:12,709
rounds like IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> if a cougar DNS</font>

315
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:15,018
update none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them is perfect we</font>

316
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:18,738
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at rerouting any cash</font>

317
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:23,989
but these are still those waves which we

318
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:28,220
need to understand better<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the third</font>

319
00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:32,629
problem I I have today manageable is it

320
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:35,540
I mean just giving the debug code is

321
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:38,839
easy learn many reasons for bottle today

322
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:41,029
it's in applications it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken and</font>

323
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:44,360
misconfigured clients and we have

324
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:46,869
observed<font color="#E5E5E5"> such situations every day on</font>

325
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">our side I mean you just take a</font>

326
00:16:46,869 --> 00:16:54,289
misconfigured client and the load from

327
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,069
that time increases by sector of 120 and

328
00:16:54,289 --> 00:17:00,980
only public internet this many users

329
00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:03,529
things extra is very rapidly<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we need</font>

actually is a if UD routing ability at

the at the application layer and it has

359

some great uses to primer it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

do many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different components</font>

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:48,970
implementing different parts of services

363
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:51,820
together so you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> your voicemail</font>

364
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:54,430
system for your IP phones you can you

365
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,470
can view your ESPN gateway in the

366
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:59,020
picture you can use applications like

367
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,420
letters notification and so on and

368
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:05,139
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all doable citizen actually very</font>

369
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:07,840
good in that but the challenge is the

370
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,300
ability to grew all the pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> together</font>

371
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,929
to create a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasonably routing</font>

372
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,970
policy for that that's one issue the

373
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,890
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue is how to deal with</font>

374
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:20,290
situations when you screwed up the

375
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,750
routing policy how to detect the error

376
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,870
and how to repair it quickly so these

377
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,720
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> two things which are excellent</font>

378
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:30,719
from our experience essential to

379
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:35,550
deployment of some larger<font color="#E5E5E5"> signet works</font>

380
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:38,220
with distributed components in it I just

381
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:40,909
I'm just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip a set of reasons</font>

382
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:44,059
by you why your routing policy maybe

383
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:46,320
maybe competence are many reasons

384
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:49,139
differentiation between anonymous and

385
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:53,010
authenticated users decoration between

386
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,960
calls to pstn and to IP phones and so on

387
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:58,140
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many reasons and even</font>

388
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,030
definitely more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a girl you just</font>

messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to be able to deal</font>

391
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:08,280
with pretty complex routing decisions at

392
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:11,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the application layer so that's doable</font>

393
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:14,820
today we we<font color="#CCCCCC"> developed a routing language</font>

394
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,650
which is able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set the conditions make</font>

395
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,990
your application while your routing

00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,630
decisions based on them and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

397
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,790
forth and it works I don't know if

398
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:27,929
you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in details let's take</font>

399
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:30,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a fine out of lack of time and the</font>

400
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:34,740
good messages words I have actually seen

401
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:37,860
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently in products of two vendors</font>

402
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:40,020
so it's a it's been recognized as you

403
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:43,439
need these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for operation and it's</font>

404
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:48,300
making its light into into commercial

405
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:51,960
products today to the maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the part</font>

406
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:54,928
of it as of today is getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

407
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,270
when they don't work why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so hard</font>

408
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:59,820
well because the application layer all

409
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:03,389
things may result in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty complex</font>

410
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,820
pad any request page it may go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

411
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:09,150
many proxy servers approaches every

412

athlete doesn't succeed in a next<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

413
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:14,970
downstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hobbit may try somewhere else</font>

414
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:19,440
and what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in bottom of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

415
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:21,900
picture is a real maze over which the

416
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,480
request moves and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have very hard</font>

417
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,850
time to learn what's going wrong wrong

418
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,190
when I've ever decides this weakness is

419
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:33,759
not acceptable to me I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> deny it</font>

420
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:37,929
and this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been unfortunately some for</font>

421
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:40,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">some reason ignored in the ICS and I</font>

422
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:42,580
think I feel that answer to this problem

423
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:46,240
is absolutely simple I'm wondering why

424
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:49,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">it hasn't been acknowledged until now</font>

425
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,850
maybe because there's too many vendors

426
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:57,129
and the idea and blue few people who

427
00:21:51,850 --> 00:22:00,189
really run the things but the idea is

428
00:21:57,129 --> 00:22:02,590
that we that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> simply mirror the</font>

429
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:07,870
incoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests which resulted in a</font>

430
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:09,970
favor with any with any negative replies

431
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:13,809
we send out and that gives the ability

432
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:16,590
to all elements in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path to look at</font>

433
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:19,450
what was the reason for the error and

434
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:22,840
it's already we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already use it in our</font>

435
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:25,360
side but the challenge is now to move

436
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,158
the industry and vendors ahead and make

437
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,279
them for this feature in every device

438

i'll try to update some cycles for that

me recap once more the things I have

441
00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:45,340
seen as important so the good news is

442
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:49,840
the basic service package is up and

443
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:53,080
running it works one needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be however</font>

performance not just in order to be able

446
00:22:56,169 --> 00:23:01,450
to deal with large population size but

in order to be primarily in order to be

448
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:08,710
able to deal with abnormal situation and

449
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:12,090
also to save you running too many boxes

450
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:16,210
which is a huge administration overhead

451
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:21,070
denial of service attacks is still a

deployment that being<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability having a</font>

455
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,870
routing flexibility is very essential to

456
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,820
getting all the components play together

457
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:40,299
and even more challenging is the ability

458
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:43,539
to troubleshoot the

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,269
showed before there is too little sigh

other things which makes me perhaps for

it most is support phone that again
