00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:14,440
keynote speakers there'll be a man V dot

107
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,719

00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,789
the program committee has a subcommittee

112
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,570
which is called our keynote committee

113
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:30,789
and they've been focusing on getting

114
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:33,490
better quality keynote speakers for this

115
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:36,760
event and this one we had Paul vixie and

our Subcommittee on keynotes so I

118
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,169
appreciate what they're trying to do and

119
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:46,840
the program committee itself is trying

120
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:48,789
to get content in too early so we can

121
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,090
build the agenda earlier so we can help

122
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:54,130
provide a an event that is beneficial to

123
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:56,560
all and again having this many people

124
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,700
here on a Wednesday is evident that what

125
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,300
they're doing is starting to invoke

126
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:03,370
change in the organization so with that

127
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,820
