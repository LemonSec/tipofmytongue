3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,410
thank you sorry I didn't want to make

4
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:25,500
things explode good morning everyone how

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,619
is the social last night I could it was

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,869
good great I can see by the little kind

7
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,960
of spotty seats that some people really

8
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,289
enjoy the social that's what it's there

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,989
for

10
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:38,879
so we're gonna start out and do a little

11
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,129
spiel for the community meeting it's

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,230
something that I think it's very very

13
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:44,910
important to give you the community a

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,970
little feedback on what's going on what

15
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,379
we're doing within the organization so

16
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,350
first thing I want to talk about is

17
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,559
outreach so in a previous operate events

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,770
Sean Kennedy had the pleasure of going

19
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:02,459
to crib nog and I by pleasure I'm

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,489
referring to the ability to effect a

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,950
greater audience so there were 60 people

22
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,290
in attendance students that he got a

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,810
chance to speak to and in those students

24
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,719
with those students Sean gave out ten

25
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,850
quality still to ten things that they do

26
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:20,100
really need to learn to help advance

27
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,658
themselves and in their careers and I'll

28
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,068
talk about four of them if you want to

29
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,049
see the rest of them you see the bottom

30
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:26,310
of that slide is the URL to where

31
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,799
there's a full article that's been

32
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,899
written about it so number one

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,329
professional success requires different

34
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:36,539
skills that you need to succeed in

35
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:40,109
school understand the importance of

36
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:43,079
humility and listen learn to listen

37
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:46,020
effectively and also never stop learning

38
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,329
we got great reviews from that speech

39
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,829
and I great I was also a live stream so

40
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,139
I think there's a video available it as

41
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,119
well but it's part of nanog greater

42
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:56,579
effort to be able to support the Neth of

43
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,499
north american community and i

44
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,818
appreciate that our board chair was

45
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:05,939
willing to go out there and represent

46
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:08,550
our organization sorry wrong way future

47
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,440
outreach events so we're going to try

48
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,860
something a little bit different coming

49
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,640
up in one of our next outreach events

50
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,660
education is kind of a an important

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,489
thing for me and I think it's an

52
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,160
important thing for our organization so

53
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,470
we're trying our first University tour

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,260
so coming up in a few weeks we're going

55
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,880
to be going to university or a bottle of

56
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,519
champagne we're going to Purdue

57
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,700
University and also Ball State and what

58
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,440
we're doing is we've tailored a Nanog

59
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,450
presentation kind of a mini Nanog that

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,030
will be kind of delivered to the

61
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,470
students this is a first-time effort and

62
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,600
we're going to be kind of fine-tuning it

63
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,040
the program committee we have a

64
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,630
subcommittee within the program

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,489
committee that's referred to as the

66
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,690
Outreach Committee and they've been

67
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,320
instrumental of bringing this all

68
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,790
together

69
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,590
so we have some great people working on

70
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,920
that and this is part of what we're

71
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:03,870
trying to do to expand our community and

72
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,880
expand the reach of Nanog also I'm going

73
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,490
to be going out with Crossy and we're

74
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,350
going to be doing a stem talk and also

75
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,680
some other presentations at the

76
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,269
University been venerable and Marcus

77
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,120
hold have been who are both part of the

78
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,460
community have been challenging us nanog

79
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,680
to go out to their community and to

80
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,450
support their efforts so this is a part

81
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,580
of reaching out to the greater community

82
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:30,829
beyond though those who can normally

83
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:34,320
come and tend to be a part of an an army

84
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:36,270
t9 on college programs so I'd like to

85
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,370
talk about our scholarship winners we

86
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:41,760
have two scholarships that we put out

87
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:44,580

88
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,190

90
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,770
those within academic community who are

91
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:56,670
trying to you know better themselves and

92
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:59,340
we get a series of applicants that come

93
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,829
in we have a panel as part of a

94
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,350
committee that evaluates them this

95
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:07,440
year's winners are Saline from Georgia

96
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,660

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,899
students were awarded scholarships on

101
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:23,400
behalf of Nana and part of the your

102
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,229

103
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,200

105
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,310

106
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,530
are not members this is what we're

107
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:35,960
trying to do with that support that you

108
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,840
give us a membership

109
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,820

110
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,500
trying to support those need to know

111
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,539
more about what's going on within our

112
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,600
community and supporting the efforts of

113
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:50,900
others so membership does benefit a

114
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,660
greater community beyond just us

115
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,989

NCI program we have three universities

117
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,160

universities have five students plus a

119
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,070

123
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:16,190
University it's a great opportunity to

124
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,660
have the students here I've been talking

125
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,660
to them and they really really enjoy

126
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:24,919
their time we also at the last meeting

127
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:27,139
we did a brandy and Lee who are part of

128
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:29,210
the natox staff have been interviewing

129
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:31,250
them if you go to Namak stories there is

130
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,780
a video there that you can see the

131
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,550
interviews of their experience and what

132
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,229
they got of being at an an odd meeting

133
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,820
and we're also doing it at this meeting

134
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:40,219
as well so we're gonna be documenting

135
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,870
how this this experience of the students

136
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,699
are hopefully as a means to get more

137
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,810
students engaged and more colleges

138
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:50,270
engaged in the program community so

139
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,389
let's talk about things related to our

140
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:56,479
committee itself Nemec stories I said

141
00:05:53,389 --> 00:06:01,070
earlier about the the interview for the

142
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,990
students and also when sorry Sean

143
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:06,050
Kennedy was in crib nog we write

144
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,270
articles about this so they're designed

145
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,699
to keep our community informed they talk

146
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,680
about highlights of nanog outreach they

147
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:14,599
recognize outstanding achievements for

148
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,530
those within our community it drives

149
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:20,810
traffic to our nanog website to boost

150
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:22,909
CEO right now on average we have about a

151
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,930
three thousand unique visitors who come

152
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:27,830
to the nanog website on a monthly basis

153
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,110
currently since the launch of our new

154
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,120
website there are 13 articles that have

155
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,259
been published so take the time go

156
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,820
through and look at some of the articles

157
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:39,020
and I'm sure you'll find things of

158
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:41,300
interest we've also released a community

159
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,859
survey survey they are surveys that go

160
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,479
on within each of these meetings that

161
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,330
talk about the talks and how things

162
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,128
happen in each day we release a greater

163
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,899
survey to our community

164
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:52,759
that's the purpose of that survey is so

165
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:55,309
that we can get guidance as we move

166
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,469
Nanog forward we want to understand what

167
00:06:55,309 --> 00:06:59,809
our community and our members feel are

168
00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:00,979
important to them to help us guide us as

169
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:04,759
we move to the future

170
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:06,558
so this survey the focus really is what

171
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:08,839
other conferences do you attend we're

172
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,699
trying to get an understanding of what

173
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,199
you guys like to see what kind of

174
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,330
speakers that are at those kind of

175
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,619
conferences which I understand how do

176
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,149
you feel about the quality of our

177
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:18,559
meetings we're trying to get an

178
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:21,019
understanding of how do you feel about

179
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:23,330
nan our governance what outreach

180
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:25,819
initiatives are important to the

181
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,248
community and what are some of the and

182
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:31,009
why some become members and why others

183
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:32,809
choose not to again all these things are

184
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:35,599
helping us in terms of governance within

185
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:37,639
our organization if you want to take the

186
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,619
survey if you look at the bottom of the

187
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,800
screen there's a URL that you can get to

188
00:07:39,619 --> 00:07:46,490
to take our surveys and please that

189
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,739
feedback is critical for us so I want to

190
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,339
talk a little bit about the industry as

191
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:51,799
a whole

192
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:53,719
Nanog is a community that's connected to

193
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,419
an industry what happens in the industry

194
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:57,979
directly affects the community and so

195
00:07:56,419 --> 00:07:59,149
it's doing a little bit of research and

196
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:01,159
here's some things that I find that I

197
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:03,289
think the audience might find a little

198
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:05,089
bit interesting right now according to

199
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,469
the Bureau of Labor Statistics there are

200
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:10,219
three hundred eighty three thousand

201
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:13,819
people who have the job title of network

202
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:15,529
engineer did a search on indeed.com

203
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:17,389
and find that right now there are

204
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:21,169
currently close to thirty thousand

205
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:23,209
openings in that narrow field of network

206
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:24,619
engineering if you start to expand it

207
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:26,509
out start to look at other kind of

208
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:29,149
related careers there's about a hundred

209
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:32,479
and thirty thousand job openings within

210
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:34,458
our community and in that according into

211
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,560
the Bureau of Labor Statistics it's

212
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:38,718
going to increase by nineteen thousand

213
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:42,500
over the next five six years as the

214
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,750
projection and that is an industry that

215
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:49,100
had that competes within about seven

216
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:51,100
hundred thousand open tech jobs the

217
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:56,300
field of cyber security expected to have

218
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:58,939
3.5 million unfilled jobs by 2020 so why

219
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,319
do these numbers matter these numbers

220
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:03,000
matter because it means that

221
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,980
we're running into this crunch time

222
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,310
where there's just not enough people to

223
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,870
keep sustaining what we're trying to do

224
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,760
most every major company has job

225
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,070
openings that are left unfulfilled and

226
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,750
which turn around and kind of reflects

227
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,530
what we have here

228
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,480
I believe that Nanog can be key to

229
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,400
helping support the community in the

230
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,230
efforts the pain points the community

231
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,439
has is the pain points that we have as

232
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:32,160
an organization and how can we nanog

233
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:35,000
help address some of those issues these

234
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,230
are all questions so we can encourage

235
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,960
students consider careers in network

236
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,460
engineering develop outreach programs

237
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,550
that empower the next generation of

238
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:46,560
network professionals create training

239
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,390
programs and Nanog conferences to help

240
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,300
individuals achieve their career goals

241
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:54,090
develop programs that help mitigate the

242
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,310
industry's employment challenges so

243
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,530
these are some of the things that we're

244
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,270
considering as a community things that I

245
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:03,329
think we're committed considering as a

246
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,430
board and how we can take support our

247
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,370
communities support our organization and

248
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,949
to do good now not just a nonprofit

249
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:14,220
organization and as an out nonprofit our

250
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:15,690
stance is to do good and how can we be

251
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,030
doing the best good for our community

252
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:21,900
for our members and also for the

253
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:23,550
industry as a whole so now I'd like to

254
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,319
invite folks up from the program

255
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,599
committee and to give you some insight

256
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,710
how the inner workings of our program

257
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,290
works thank you yeah so a week or two

258
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,360
ago we you know Edward said hey I'm

259
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:39,449
gonna do a community meeting as he's

260
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,620
done a few times maybe maybe the program

261
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,750
committee could talk about what you do

262
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,510
and so I'm Benson

263
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,790
we've got Vince and Steve we are the

264
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,380
officers of the program committee but

265
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,540
the program committees it's actually a

266
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,070
big team 25 people right now I think was

267
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,589
that the largest it's ever been yeah and

268
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,570
it's working pretty well that being said

269
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:01,920
I assume most of you don't even know

270
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:07,440
what we do so I had an ugly diagram that

271
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,760
we're pretty dude up thank you I I made

272
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,950
it as a circle intentionally right

273
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,480
because we iterate meeting after meeting

274
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,970
we do the same things we kind of fall

275
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,040
into a pattern it turns out as I

276
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,480
said a couple times most people don't

277
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,149
know what that pattern is they don't

278
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,139
know how to engage with it if you want

279
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:23,850
to make a submission you want to

280
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,860
understand you know when it's a talking

281
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,649
to be accepted it's ever so real quick

282
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:32,009
view first of all there's about three

283
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:34,920
sometimes four months in between events

284
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:38,550
right so you can imagine this cycling

285
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,769
over that time period shortly after each

286
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,540
nanog we issue a call for proposals it

287
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:45,480
has a link where to submit a talk idea

288
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,730
and and then you know slowly over time

289
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,819
people go to the portal they create

290
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,709
let's say a proposal has an abstract as

291
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:54,930
that happens so we're receiving

292
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:57,660
proposals as that happens we assign

293
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:58,859
someone we call a shepherd the job of

294
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,449
the Shepherd is really they just sort of

295
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,879
walk through the process with the

296
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:06,029
speaker provide feedback on the content

297
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:09,120
the idea help help make it work well as

298
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:11,610
well as a can right so if you for

299
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,079
example want to submit a proposal within

300
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,060
a couple weeks after making that

301
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:16,500
submission you should get an email from

302
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,569
somebody on the program committee saying

303
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:24,269
hi I'm your Shepherd here's how to get a

304
00:12:18,569 --> 00:12:25,829
hold of me etc we the this is this is a

305
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:28,470
point I want to make sure is understood

306
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:30,329
we usually don't start voting on whether

307
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,879
to accept the talk or not until we see

308
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:34,469
slides this is something a lot of people

309
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,670
don't quite understand they wait until

310
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,959
the last minute to give slides which

311
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,120
means we don't start voting until the

312
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,550
last minute on that talk which often

313
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,170
means we've filled the agenda and people

314
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,149
miss out on the opportunity to present

315
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:49,170
so anybody in the room that's

316
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:50,879
considering making a proposal when you

317
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,769
make the proposal my just personal

318
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,259
advice to you is upload slides even if

319
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:57,689
they are super early draft it gives us a

320
00:12:55,259 --> 00:13:01,199
better idea more than we can see in just

321
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:02,790
the abstract for example once we see

322
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:05,490
those slides the the program committee

323
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,529
as a whole when the Shepherd says the

324
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,959
slides are there it's pretty much ready

325
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:12,839
for us to begin to evaluate we start

326
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:15,569
voting and there are as I said there 25

327
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,129
of us we have a threshold of around 10

328
00:13:15,569 --> 00:13:19,229
people we want to make sure have

329
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:22,529
reviewed the material first they give a

330
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:24,329
rating between 1 to 5 typically

331
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:26,100
something that's in the let's say mid to

332
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:28,709
high fours means everybody on the

333
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,950
program committee wants to see that talk

334
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:34,560
as it drops down you know we might

335
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:38,130
actually decline talks if they're not at

336
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,040
the level that we want when when we vote

337
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:43,260
we choose to accept it there is a

338
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,449
there's a deadline for the final slides

339
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,689
to be provided to us ahead of the

340
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:50,730
meeting at that that's important because

341
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,680
we review those slides for for several

342
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,120
things but mostly to make sure that

343
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,910
they're not marketing material there's

344
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,670
not logos that are advertising to you

345
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,199
right as as the community at nanog we're

346
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,990
trying to make sure that you get good

347
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:07,110
educational content and not just

348
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:09,540
advertising not sales pitches and then

349
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,610
of course we publish the agenda we have

350
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:15,750
the conference we iterate on this over

351
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:19,950
and over again that being said so in

352
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:23,090
this in this cycle I look back thank you

353
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:27,150
to Val for providing some numbers to me

354
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:29,280
we we get varying numbers of proposals

355
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,350
meeting after meeting it it sometimes

356
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,970
depends on the locale is it a place

357
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:37,170
people want to be do they want to

358
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:39,780
present that etc we accept you see on

359
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:42,420
the far side the far right we we accept

360
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:45,089
about an average of 30 talks or pieces

361
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,860
of content some of these are like two

362
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,970
hour-long tutorials so these are 10

363
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,870
minute lightning talks right it's

364
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,390
everything in between

365
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:55,830
so that number is you know it is what it

366
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:58,170
is we we decline about half of the talks

367
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,910
that people proposed to us I don't know

368
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,620
if that's a metric of quality or not but

369
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:04,890
it's an interesting thing for us to

370
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,990
track certainly we can't put on a good

371
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:09,569
conference as a program committee unless

372
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:13,470
you as a community give us good content

373
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:15,600
so so so I encourage you to please give

374
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,070
us your ideas by the way if you have an

375
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,380
idea for a talk and you're just not sure

376
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:21,660
maybe on the sense talk to us we are

377
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:27,110
always here to to help you bounce ideas

378
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,110
off etc and with that

379
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:36,599
sorry so the MIDI yourself organized

380
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:39,118
that means the the board doesn't get to

381
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,269
tell us how to how we do things we

382
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:44,189
decide ourselves so after every

383
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:47,699
selection cycle in February our first

384
00:15:44,189 --> 00:15:49,019
meeting we put on officers and then form

385
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:53,279
subcommittees as needed

386
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:56,249
excuse me so the officers as listed here

387
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,720
the chair that Benson in this case who

388
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:59,939
leads the committee moderate the

389
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,799
conference's and also very importantly

390
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:03,929
is our liaison to the board so he

391
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:06,660
attends the board meetings advocates for

392
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:09,059
us the front of the board and reports

393
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:13,259
back what's happening on the board the

394
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:15,809
vice chair Vince this time is a assist

395
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:17,819
the chair and fills in as needed and

396
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:20,728
also does ferment of the grunt work

397
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:23,009
behind the scenes and the secretary is

398
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:24,989
meet right now is in charge of

399
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:26,399
organizing the presentation content so

400
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:28,229
the fact that there were slides up for

401
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,589
you to see is because me and my

402
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:34,289
committee managed to do that in time and

403
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:38,759
also act as backup to the backup for the

404
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:40,559
chair and vice chair we have a bunch of

405
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:42,779
subcommittees and it's important to

406
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,238
realize that this evolves over time as

407
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:48,269
we see needs and people volunteer and

408
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:50,309
become interested in things I'll mention

409
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:52,139
a couple of them there's a lot right now

410
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:54,358
but the content management committee is

411
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:56,009
the one I lead which is like I said

412
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:58,079
responsible for reviewing the slides

413
00:16:56,009 --> 00:17:01,230
making sure that the logos that go on

414
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,149
things like that we have the hackathon

415
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,490
committee which put on the hackathon

416
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:07,819
this past Sunday and before every

417
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,870
meeting and they do a lot of work

418
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:13,428
getting prepared working with the

419
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:17,158
sponsors to get that going

420
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:20,399
keynote committee invites and finds

421
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:21,600
keynote speakers um I want to thank them

422
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:23,698

425
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:32,879
solicits and organizes the lightning

426
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:35,990
talks and outreach are the ones who are

427
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:38,409

428
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,120

430
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,419

and finally the women in tech

432
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:50,800
subcommittee which I'm put on the

433
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:53,710
lunched yesterday and is busy trying to

434
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,360
figure out how ok

435
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,970
sorry this thing's in front of

436
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,719
me trying to figure out how the women in

437
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:04,510
tech events should evolve there was a

438
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,040
survey yesterday I believe in lunch so

439
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,750
if you have opinions please fill that

440
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,750
out or talk to the women tech leaders

441
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:16,930
okay now it's Vince's turn I'm just

442
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,930
gonna go over a little quickly on how to

443
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:22,900
volunteer and give back to the community

444
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:26,650
every February at the neon conference

445
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:29,050
you can do self nomination or nominate

446
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,870
someone else to the program committee

447
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:33,940
the actual selection is done by the

448
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:36,090
board though but again if you have any

449
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,140
interest want to know more about the

450
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,389
responsibilities come up to any one of

451
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,690
us that are on the program maybe and we

452
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:45,820
can give you a little bit more details

453
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:47,770
the actual deliverables are what you do

454
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:51,610
on the program committee as far as

455
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:55,389
volunteering is attending talks actually

456
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:59,979
helping solicit and get content up on

457
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:03,520
stage we also ask to have them serve a

458
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:05,530
two-year term and we all understand that

459
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:09,250
we have a day job and this is a

460
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:12,700
volunteer work realistically maybe 10

461
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:16,540
hours to 12 in the next 12 weeks coming

462
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:18,670
up to emitting is what we are expecting

463
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:21,129
people to volunteer their time for and

464
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,990
it's very important so again if you have

465
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,880
any interest please come up to us

466
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:31,320
there's a link there for a little bit

467
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,320
more detail that's that's good

468
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:40,769
for those 12 weeks the question was is

469
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:42,988
that ten hours a week or ten hours for

470
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:45,929
the twelve weeks into this ladder thank

471
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:47,489
you that being said there there are jobs

472
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:49,979
and tasks that can take more time

473
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:52,499
certainly the three of us and especially

474
00:19:49,979 --> 00:19:54,509
recently Steve as the person responsible

475
00:19:52,499 --> 00:20:00,450
for content puts in a lot of that a lot

476
00:19:54,509 --> 00:20:01,979
of time but do not be scared you if you

477
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,080
want to join the program committee and

478
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:05,789
you can bring your time and and and

479
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,509
focus it's gonna be useful whether it's

480
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:10,919
you know 10 hours or 120 hours whatever

481
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:12,929
we'd appreciate that right and I'll just

482
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,029
mention also that the next solicitation

483
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:17,789
for program committee members will be

484
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:20,309
probably in January for selection in

485
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:22,289
February and and now I would like to

486
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:24,149
open up to anyone have any questions

487
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:27,720
regarding the program committee myself

488
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:29,488
or the board in general so if you the

489
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,649
mics are open if you'd like to come and

490
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:36,629
ask a question we're happy to try our

491
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:38,158
best to answer it if you do not come up

492
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:51,689
to the mics I'm assuming we're doing an

493
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:53,580
amazing job and we just keep a crisp

494

committee member one thing that I

496
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:01,440
noticed is missing from those slides is

497
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:02,820
the fact that there is a subcommittee in

498
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,950
the paren committee that organizes the

499
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:11,939
Sunday hackathon was there there was a

500
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:13,979
hackathon on Sunday oh there was a point

501
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,599
ok I must have missed it I'm sorry no we

502
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:16,909
if we didn't highlight it enough though

503
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,189
that that's actually a great example

504
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:22,200
we've organized the PC into these

505
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,539
subcommittees so that we can have people

506
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,070
focus get things done the hackathon is a

507
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:28,739
great example there's a subcommittee of

508
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,658
people who make that event happen and

509
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:31,859
and so for example if you love the

510
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:34,379
hackathon and you want to see it

511
