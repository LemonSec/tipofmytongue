1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,930
hello everyone which we have an

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,529
enjoyable lunch time in the next 30

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:23,970
minutes that I'm going to share with you

4
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:28,200
about what can an international cartel

5
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:31,049
co teach you about China before I do

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,780
that let me introduce myself my name is

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:37,170
a saiping so people usually call me

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,510
typing it as a network I love this name

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,090
a lot because ping P ing pain you know

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,660
everybody loved years means that you

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,950
know pain is the important tools to

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,199
validate the connectivity like myself

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,829
I'm the important rules to ensure the

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,899
connectivity is okay for every body

15
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:57,840
indeed my cell I've been working for an

16
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:02,129
international telco Telstra for the last

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,290
20 years in the first 16 years I've been

18
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,830
helping the company to manage the

19
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,500
international network which is s 42nd 37

20
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,150
which I believe that I met some of you

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:17,490
that we have two P rings before and then

22
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:20,100
around four to five years ago Telstra

23
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,429
acquired padlet and at that time that we

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,520
also acquire John mention company in

25
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,000
China which is Telstra PPS and that's

26
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,149
why I move over there to work for

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,200
Telstra PPS which I helped the company

28
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,060
to rebuild the domestic network there so

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,700
that's why here you see there's another

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,369
s number yes for the seven nine sixteen

31
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:49,110
five and the other one fifty-five nine

32
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:52,890
double eight so indeed for myself I

33
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,200
graduate in the u.s. so this place us is

34
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:59,400
not new to me I'm based in Hong Kong

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,040
that so that's why I would like to based

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,860
on my international experience and also

37
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,269
my current experience in China to talk

38
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:12,420
about how we can build network in China

39
00:02:08,269 --> 00:02:15,900
before we do so I guess everybody when

40
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,030
you want to route traffic or connect to

41
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,030
the content in China that you always

42
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,360
encounter issues like long latency and

43
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,240
also all

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,850
they transversing into china need to go

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,880
through the Great Firewall so the

46
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,579
performance is not that good as a

47
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,780
workaround that a lot of people will put

48
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,430
your infrastructures near China which

49
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,860
means that you will put your

50
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,620
infrastructure in the DC in let's say

51
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:48,430
Tokyo in Japan Hong Kong or Singapore

52
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:51,130
and then you also need to subscribe the

53
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:54,270
service on your SP with direct China

54
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:57,370
option then you can lower your latency

55
00:02:54,270 --> 00:03:00,250
however the drawback is the cost is

56
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,290
relatively high and also still and kind

57
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,080
of the potential congestion issue at the

58
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:10,179
Great Firewall plus the quality still

59
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:12,340
regular bit so in order to tackle a

60
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:18,489
problem you will need to build your

61
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:20,890
network inside the firewall before you

62
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:23,560
can be or network there are few things

63
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:26,079
you need to consider so here I summarize

64
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,750
my experience that are there are few

65
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,870
building blocks that you need to follow

66
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:35,790
first of all you need to acquire the

67
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:38,950
appropriate license with the regulatory

68
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:42,130
compliance once you have the correct

69
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:44,160
license then next step you can start to

70
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,600
think about building your infrastructure

71
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,810
build infrastructure in China is not

72
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:53,260
that straightforward I remember when I

73
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:55,299
first rebooted network the first stage

74
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,730
that's where a lot of time there is

75
00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:01,510
doing some bidding process because you

76
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:03,640
want you find the lowest cost one common

77
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,859
things in China is that is not an easy

78
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,600
go direct for example you will want to

79
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,610
buy all equipment from a particular

80
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,220
vendor you know go through distributor

81
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,910
when you go with distributor then you

82
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,500
need to ensure that the product or the

83
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:20,829
equipment you buy is the real product

84
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:23,200
not kind of it so that's why I spent a

85
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,090
lot of time to validate what I'm going

86
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,909
to purchase and then after the purchase

87
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:31,150
that where that also divides are the

88
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:34,090
ones that are valid and then we start

89
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,429
the infrastructure bill so after you

90
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,130
build an infrastructure

91
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,500
then you need to think about the

92
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,300
connectivities because if you don't have

93
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,310
the connectivity otherwise that you end

94
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,240
up with an island that you have for your

95
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:50,699
DCD and then connect you nowhere so

96
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,330
that's why the next step is to find

97
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:57,120
eligible service provider to bring you

98
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,698
the domestic plus the international

99
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,759
capacities so once you will figure this

100
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,680
out and and all those connect then you

101
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,440
start your business and the business

102
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,490
that you run you need to have the

103
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,469
regular compliance check because of the

104
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:16,800
environment in China that like the

105
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,139
license that we are having is in general

106
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,180
need to renew on yearly basis so that's

107
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:25,139
why you need to have a regular check as

108
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,090
you know China is a country that a lot

109
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,310
of things are government driven so

110
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,929
that's why you need to be prepared for

111
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:37,740
the frequent changing government policy

112
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:39,660
so these are the few factors that you

113
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:45,330
need to consider when you build Network

114
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:48,060
inside China as some service provider

115
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:50,550
how internet and also cloud provider a

116
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,800
few things that you need to be mindful

117
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,470
in in terms of the challenge first of

118
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,470
all is the internet bandwidth it's not

119
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:00,090
straightforward that if you have the

120
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,789
money then you can battle for everything

121
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:05,190
you can it's not it's not the case it's

122
00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:07,919
quite complicated when you purchased our

123
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,659
bandwidth from the incumbent and the

124
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,299
other things on you need to make sure is

125
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:15,300
the IP addresses that you are using to

126
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:20,370
route traffic must be register under the

127
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:23,669
China NIC not a PA nor Aaron the other

128
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,699
challenge is regarding the data center

129
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:29,698
resources that are when you select where

130
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:33,780
you put your device ensure that your

131
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:37,409
data center is having scalable enough to

132
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,299
copy of your never expansion because you

133
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:41,430
don't want on the end up with you build

134
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,919
up up there and then less than a year

135
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:47,569
that because of some unsatisfactory

136
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,308
stuff that you need to move so you

137
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:51,349
they want to avoid that so that's why

138
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:54,110
you need to build a long-term strategic

139
00:06:51,349 --> 00:06:58,998
relationship with your local partner and

140
00:06:54,110 --> 00:07:00,979
the third thing about Liza's MOU in

141
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:03,199
China I think similar to any other

142
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:05,740
countries that you operate business you

143
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,050
need to obtain the appropriate license

144
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:11,689
one thing to remember is when you do

145
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,669
business in China you will be the

146
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:16,610
customers in local currency which is

147
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:18,709
which means they're renminbi you need a

148
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,449
license to build a customer's new

149
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:22,369
relevant B so it is something that is

150
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:25,959
important that a lot of people will miss

151
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:28,759
it and certainly the regulatory

152
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:30,110
compliance due to the frequent change in

153
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,559
the government policy is something that

154
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:37,039
you need to be mindful and then the

155
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:39,379
internet content provider registration

156
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,378
is another thing that need to be mindful

157
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:45,169
because it would be required by n

158
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,529
customers to open port 80 because in

159
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:49,459
China

160
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:52,058
port 80 is a closed by default so there

161
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:54,649
are some procedures you need to follow

162
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:57,979
otherwise that you won't be able to get

163
00:07:54,649 --> 00:08:00,619
the registration done and last but not

164
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:03,378
least is the local relationship I've

165
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:05,689
experienced that because you need to

166
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:08,059
have a good partner local partner there

167
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:10,819
to help you to drive the successful

168
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:15,499
implementations of your services in

169
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:16,069
China before I jump deeper into the

170
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:19,399
bracketry

171
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:21,319
in China to make it simple the Chinese

172
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:25,009
government is a we can consider at the

173
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:28,189
top level is the National people

174
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:31,639
Congress we call it an NPC and the

175
00:08:28,189 --> 00:08:33,500
underneath is the State Council and that

176
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,750
underneath the State Council is the M

177
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,610
RIT which you probably have heard about

178
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:42,529
it which is the Ministry of Industry and

179
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,909
information technologies so all these

180
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:47,600
three different levels of government

181
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:50,089
bodies will impose different levels of

182
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,959
registries for example like as a service

183
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:57,589
provider that the State Council will

184
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:59,660
impose like the telecom Beijing law in

185
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:00,360
China and rocketry or Internet

186
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,209
Information

187
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,060
whereas for the MRI t that they will

188
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:10,420
impose the regulations on telecom cajun

189
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:13,599
business license and also the regulation

190
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:16,479
or internet domain and also the internet

191
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,990
management well these are the name that

192
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,790
I do the translation into some readable

193
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:25,240
English because all these regulations

194
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:27,399
are only written in Chinese but here I

195
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,620
just want you give you an idea what

196
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,079
let's talk about what are the key things

197
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,420
that you need be mindful and as the

198
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:37,559
general business operation compliance

199
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,998
there are few things that impose by the

200
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:42,939
National people Congress like the

201
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:47,649
cybersecurity law and the guiding state

202
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:49,959
secrets and then on the State Council

203
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:52,269
they also have the regulations on

204
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:54,969
computing information and also the

205
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:58,420
safety protection the safety protection

206
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:00,910
here is the well known as the data

207
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,550
sovereignty thinks that the in China

208
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:06,519
that there's a rules that talking about

209
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,500
all the customer sensitive information

210
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,459
must be kept inside China

211
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,379
you cannot export it outside China

212
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:18,040
having said that there's no clear

213
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:20,110
definition of what it means by sensitive

214
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,319
customer information so that's why we

215
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:26,589
need to have somebody who are familiar

216
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:29,229
with the local laws that you don't fall

217
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:31,269
into the trap that well you will not be

218
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:37,269
able to renew your liza even if you have

219
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:40,629
got it so let me go into a deep dive

220
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:44,439
into the security information security

221
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:46,600
there so as everybody know Internet

222
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:49,990
traffic in China is subject to many

223
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,809
rules and regulations and then the

224
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:56,980
content if they're steamed and disabled

225
00:10:52,809 --> 00:11:01,329
or in ego would be remove which will be

226
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:03,999
remove very quick I will remember under

227
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:05,859
some circumstances that because there

228
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:08,709
are some important government meetings

229
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:11,889
the government require all the local ISP

230
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,750
to shut down any website within one

231
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:16,620
minute

232
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:18,720
after they announce to all those ISP so

233
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,110
you can imagine how quickly that we need

234
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,959
to adopt to the changing environment and

235
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:28,980
what the government imposed and I said

236
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:31,670
before poor 18 ISM close by default so

237
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,920
business who need to have a web server

238
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:39,449
then they need to apply for the opening

239
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:42,709
of port 80 the way that you do you need

240
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:45,589
to follow some procedures need to submit

241
00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:47,729
ICP the internet content provider

242
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:50,399
registration here I talked about

243
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,680
registration not license to the

244
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,769
authorities talking about saying that

245
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,560
the service that you use the port 80

246
00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:01,920
will be used for what and if you have

247
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,670
like mail server domain name server then

248
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:11,009
you need to register separately in terms

249
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:14,069
of the ICP stuff that that two levels

250
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:18,509
the first one the easier one is the ICP

251
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:22,410
filling that for the end user who host

252
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:24,680
web services in China that you need to

253
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:28,230
do the ICP feeling talking about

254
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:32,910
deported using like port 80 for HTTP and

255
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:35,639
then 443 for HTTPS and then if your

256
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:39,870
content contains some information like

257
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:42,870
our regarding news movies a culture

258
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:46,910
television that broadcasting then you

259
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:49,949
need to have another forum approval and

260
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:52,709
if the operation website that you're

261
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:55,439
running that have some content

262
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:59,279
commercial contexts such as if you want

263
00:12:55,439 --> 00:13:02,279
to run online shopping trading and

264
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,899
gaming then you need to apply this in

265
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:07,170
this case you need to apply the ICP

266
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:08,970
license and unfortunately at the moment

267
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,699
the foreign companies

268
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:17,370
I need not able to acquire a zip here

269
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:19,709
only a few for enjoy JV John venture can

270
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:26,610
apply it but they still for difficult in

271
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:28,619
practice so as some cloud service

272
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,950
if you want to expand your business in

273
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,140
China that you need to identify a good

274
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,660
partner before we do that you also need

275
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,630
to understand what sorts of roles that

276
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:42,150
you have to do certainly you need to

277
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:45,300
provide your own design your requirement

278
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,220
on the data center and also the hardware

279
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,349
the infrastructure that you built and

280
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,440
then the software certain is running it

281
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:56,340
by you and the fourth thing is about

282
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:59,460
need to follow some very specific DC

283
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:02,640
operation process just to share with

284
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:05,790
everybody here that from my experience a

285
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,920
lot of DC in China that when you ask for

286
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,709
remote health services since much

287
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,829
trouble people can only speak Chinese or

288
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:16,320
mentoring they'll ask you for

289
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:18,180
translation if you give them English in

290
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,320
written in English or remote hand

291
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:24,859
requests then they probably won't well

292
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,920
take care of it because they need

293
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,960
Chinese to interpret so that's why you

294
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,790
need to ensure you have somebody who can

295
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,650
do the translation for you to proceed

296
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:38,939
your work otherwise you get stuck in the

297
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:42,350
middle and the last one is are certainly

298
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:46,760
uniquely also implement your own

299
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:50,480
customer data security policy and the DC

300
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:54,330
one things about the partner you select

301
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,610
why is it so important is that because

302
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,590
you need your partner to deal with the

303
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:03,350
government the government always have a

304
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:08,510
lot of new policy or some sudden

305
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:10,950
requirement then if you are not aware or

306
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:13,050
familiarized with the local laws then

307
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,670
you don't know how to deal with it so

308
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,800
you need to need to rely on your partner

309
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,930
to do so and other things about the

310
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,569
license that even if you get a license

311
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:24,030
you need somebody to help you to reunion

312
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,520
renew your license as the license is

313
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,110
kind of like on a yearly basis that are

314
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,300
and from time to time there a lot of

315
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:32,520
people will probably go to inspect you

316
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,880
then you need somebody to take care of

317
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,380
it

318
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,900
and and then apart from the government

319
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:42,930
relationship the other thing is about

320
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,819
dear customers as I mentioned before in

321
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:47,280
China that because we build your

322
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:50,640
customers in local currency renminbi so

323
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:53,069
you have to ensure that your partner's

324
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:56,010
you help you have the license to do the

325
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:58,980
contract and do the customers and lastly

326
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:01,860
about the connectivities that you need

327
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:06,540
to ensure that the data center that you

328
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:09,720
Peck is able to provide you the

329
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:17,520
necessary service provider or to

330
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:21,060
connectivity's that go into your DC so

331
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:24,660
before we jump to the network piece let

332
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:29,790
me give you a brief China network 101

333
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:33,350
class back in early 2000 in China that

334
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:36,689
they split into three key incumbent

335
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:39,450
China Unicom that they are predominately

336
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:41,970
managing to the north China the

337
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:45,150
demarcation point is a north of Shanghai

338
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,880
and then south of Shanghai will be China

339
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:49,890
Telecom and then China Mobile by his

340
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:55,050
name he's managed the entire mobile

341
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:57,840
network in China and then the Great

342
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:00,660
Firewall we spoke about before then in

343
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,810
China that there are three international

344
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,659
gateway that put in the Great Firewall

345
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:09,179
that will be Beijing Shanghai and

346
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,510
Guangzhou those that would be from north

347
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:14,910
and then east and their self and the

348
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,280
locations of the Great Firewall is

349
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,820
putting in the middle between the cable

350
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,649
learning stations and the routers at the

351
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:25,439
internet exchange point which means that

352
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:28,110
forever traffic exchange in an hour

353
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:35,090
China that will need to filter by this

354
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:37,949
Great Firewall so when you set up

355
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:41,550
internet platform inside China it's a

356
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:45,930
bit tricky I would say we are some if

357
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:48,960
you need to bind Internet services from

358
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:53,530
the domestic service provider you may

359
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:56,230
always heard about the name static BGP

360
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:58,690
this is what kind of tricky hearing you

361
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:02,140
so when I first heard about this work

362
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:05,500
but bgp already from international term

363
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:08,110
is talking about something dynamic but

364
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:12,040
how come there's a work study in front

365
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:13,929
it's kind of contradicting but if you

366
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,240
are able to digest the diagram not

367
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:18,940
panicking you understand why you look

368
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,190
from the top that this did the normal

369
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:24,190
bgp session that you're setting up or

370
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:26,640
build it with the incumbent through the

371
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:31,090
international gateway and then

372
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,360
underneath those incumbent they are also

373
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:36,790
connecting each other through bgp

374
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:40,600
however the capacities among them will

375
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:45,159
be quite limited so that's why you

376
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:48,280
always encounter packet laws or high

377
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,440
latency when the traffic transfers from

378
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:55,780
one platform one carrier to another

379
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:58,270
carrier so that's why as domestics also

380
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,990
wider you need to connect you all three

381
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:06,190
of them the way that we exchange Rao is

382
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:10,570
that those incumbent indeed just sending

383
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:12,100
you static route or in some cases if you

384
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,679
have good relationship then you're able

385
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:18,100
to get some partial BGP routes that send

386
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,260
from the incumbent however on the

387
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,620
reverse directions for the search

388
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:27,610
provider that you can exchange your

389
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:29,260
route sending to the incumbent but

390
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,090
that's the way that if the constraint is

391
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:34,780
indeed you can imagine it's just a

392
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:37,919
purely static routing so as a general

393
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:41,050
customers when you buy service from the

394
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,300
domestic internet service provider then

395
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,669
you just simply connect to them and they

396
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,460
they will just send you a default route

397
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:51,490
so this is kind of a mixed of on the

398
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,770
upstreams I will BGP but then indeed you

399
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:56,980
are subscribing service using static so

400
00:19:53,770 --> 00:20:00,670
how they call the static BGP route they

401
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:03,970
always have is in mainland China so if I

402
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:04,880
look at from the look at it from the s

403
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:09,890
path

404
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:13,220
practive since do you out that you have

405
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:16,010
are not indeed announced by you this

406
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:19,960
will be announced by your upstream that

407
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:23,120
is incumbent most incumbent here is that

408
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,610
even within different differing

409
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,850
incumbent that they always have some

410
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:31,580
other AAS connecting to them in each

411
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:33,679
province so the way that the

412
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,530
announcement will do is they were

413
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:39,320
announced under those sub a s and then

414
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:41,360
through the in company yes to the global

415
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,760
Internet so that's why we need on the

416
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,750
looking-glass when you do show IP BGP

417
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,850
and you only can look at LCD as par for

418
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:53,650
the incumbent and the downstream you

419
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,649
would never able to see your own s path

420
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,540
one thing I want to highlight here is

421
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:02,300
that the IP addresses that you are using

422
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,280
must be registered under China make if

423
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:09,399
he is not on the China neck then the IP

424
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,399
address cannot be broadcast within China

425
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:17,270
so yeah I like to compare do a little

426
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,150
comparison about the routing inside

427
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:22,370
China and the rest of the world so in

428
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:24,860
China predominantly will be static

429
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:29,270
routing whereas outside China Oh bill

430
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:33,050
like the normal VDP dynamic routing the

431
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:35,480
network they never route that a national

432
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:39,980
public internet will be under the

433
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:42,110
incumbent EF rather than your own a s as

434
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,690
I mentioned before all the network

435
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:48,709
routes must be register and China Nick

436
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:51,580
and one key things is that in China

437
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:54,410
there's no settlement free peering

438
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:57,429
everything will be to pay reverse

439
00:21:54,410 --> 00:22:00,590
internationally that well we can form

440
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:03,260
which will appearing anywhere depending

441
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:06,980
on the commercial construct so that's

442
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:09,650
why BG be peering is kind of highly

443
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:12,410
restricted in China

444
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:16,510
rev asam in the outside world then peach

445
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:16,510
be peering is a highly market driven

446
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:23,019
so that the last thing I want to talk

447
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:26,029
about here is just the conclusion about

448
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:29,299
well although there be a lot of

449
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:31,460
compliance regulatory things that you

450
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:34,940
need to follow running into the business

451
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:38,929
is still feasible as long as you find

452
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:42,379
the appropriate partners to help you to

453
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:45,019
follow the compliance and also it would

454
00:22:42,379 --> 00:22:47,418
be flexible and stay alert to the

455
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:50,990
frequent changes in the bucket or

456
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:53,659
requirement and if you need to by

457
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,019
transit in our upstream services in

458
00:22:53,659 --> 00:22:56,539
China

459
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:58,009
static BGP is the default option so

460
00:22:56,539 --> 00:23:00,559
don't be scared next time we have you

461
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:02,299
heard about this word static BGP that

462
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,149
are how come steady and BGP work

463
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:08,720
together but this is norm so neat you

464
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:11,239
know you understand this and then if you

465
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,340
want to have a better connectivity then

466
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,360
you're better to need to ensure that you

467
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:20,449
have a multiple connection to different

468
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,570
incumbent or you can look at yourself

469
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:25,669
avoid whether they have this kind of

470
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:29,629
multiple connectivity and last but not

471
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:31,789
least as a network designer that is

472
00:23:29,629 --> 00:23:34,639
pretty important to build redundancy in

473
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:38,090
your network design don't have the wrong

474
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:40,939
assumptions so that's pretty much what I

475
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:44,090
want to share with everyone based on my

476
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:47,179
past experience I believe I do have time

477
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:49,779
for Q&A sessions so I'm open the floor

478
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:49,779
for any questions

479
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:17,360
most curious about uh VPN services and

480
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,809
we need to connect back yep

481
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,219
VPN that certainly VPN is another

482
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:24,129
typical service that a lot of people

483
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:29,210
buying from China which require a

484
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:31,850
separate license so what I'm talking

485
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:36,380
about today is focusing on the internet

486
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:39,379
platform we pn well they will follow the

487
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,690
similar regulatory requirement but they

488
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,960
are on the separate sets of our license

489
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:47,389
that that you require so VPN services

490
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,000
needs a certain available in in China

491
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:53,928
that but you need to ensure that when

492
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,929
you buy that your service provider is

493
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:59,149
having that appropriate license and the

494
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:01,730
license that I mentioned is on because

495
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:05,539
in China that the license they are grant

496
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:08,659
to a particular province some of them

497
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:10,908
may have the national wildlife but you

498
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:14,809
need to check against what your source

499
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:18,320
what is heaven otherwise for some day if

500
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:19,639
you subscribe unlicensed services then

501
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:31,399
your service do get shut down

502
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:32,928
immediately was it I was speaking of

503
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:35,418
IPSec VPN Oh

504
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:37,130
IPSec use another one that IPSec I

505
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:40,929
believe you are talking about running IP

506
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:46,490
set through the public Internet yes Oh

507
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:48,740
officially that is among is is legal

508
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:51,049
within China to domestic China which

509
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:54,649
means that according to the law that are

510
00:25:51,049 --> 00:26:00,730
your IP set will need to terminate at a

511
00:25:54,649 --> 00:26:00,729
gateway inside China okay thank you

512
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:08,250

513
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:11,960
hi Chris morrow Google I have sort of a

514
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:17,580
regular operations question dealing with

515
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:19,590
is better okay dealing with the remote

516
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,439
provider in China both for things

517
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:24,030
deployed inside the PRC and things that

518
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,010
cross the border is sometimes

519
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:28,530
challenging at least for me

520
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:33,090
and I wonder if that's just language

521
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:35,220
specific problems or expectations how

522
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:39,899
would you normally troubleshoot link

523
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:42,060
problems or traffic problems pretty good

524
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:45,720
questions that a lot of foreign telco

525
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:49,590
always ask me about this well when you

526
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:52,050
find some interesting routing when you

527
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:54,600
the traffic properly across across the

528
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:57,260
border then a lot of chances that it

529
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,840
will be filtered by the quick firewall

530
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:04,610
but you never be able to have a definite

531
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:07,919
answer but that's from what we observe

532
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:11,370
if you have some miscellaneous well some

533
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:14,820
packets or some traffic that the

534
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:17,820
government may not want and you will get

535
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,570
discard okay all right that that part I

536
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,790
get

537
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:24,510
the US government turns off lots of

538
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:28,020
common net zones all the time sub zones

539
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:29,730
I guess my question really is like for a

540
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,150
deployment inside the PRC we've had

541
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:36,020
instances of large volumes of traffic

542
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:40,440
arriving and the provider has no ability

543
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:44,850
in quotes to tell us what's going on or

544
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,620
fix it but in particular like I know

545
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:49,919
there's an arbor deployment in that

546
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:53,909
network so pretty sure they could figure

547
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:57,060
it out well I believe you are talking

548
00:27:53,910 --> 00:28:02,070
about some the now service attack that

549
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:05,820
okay well indeed those incumbent that

550
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:09,689
they do have this capability and it is

551
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:13,189
also some services that you can buy to

552
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:17,340
have this kind of a DDoS our filtering

553
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:20,790
so I guess one of the reasons that

554
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:22,800
time your transit cannot be doing that

555
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:25,350
is because of the static routing that I

556
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,930
just mentioned before that they don't

557
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:31,260
have the too much flexibility to be

558
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:36,750
routed traffic and after they identify

559
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:45,060
the denial service attack okay thanks

560
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:46,160
thanks okay then thanks a lot for your

561
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:54,109
time

562
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:54,109
[Applause]

563
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,040
you
