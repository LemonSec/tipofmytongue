of this before I go and introduce myself

101
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:29,180
I just have one question for everyone

102
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:31,609
how many of you like beer okay that's

103
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,020
that's a good response I I expected

104
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,640
probably almost hundred percent but

105
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,460
we'll take 90 percent that's good enough

106
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,229
so there is a fun fact I will share like

107
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,450
after you know a couple minutes that I

108
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:44,840
want to talk about and few facts about

109
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:48,860
Austin but before that good morning and

110
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:51,049

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,380

the best of industry networking experts

120
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,820
from around the globe so in this room

121
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:26,180
are the people who said the direction of

122
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:29,120
Technology not just for the industry but

123
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:31,729
also you know the newer use cases and

124
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,720
things that you enable in your networks

125
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:37,969
so along those lines as you are you know

126
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,130
marching towards your journey of digital

127
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,470
transformation which is a very important

128
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:45,650
mission nowadays as you're marching

129
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,900
towards that so there are some of the

130
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,609
key things that you know we hear like

131
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,849
network operators are increasingly

132
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:56,780
looking for the apps and tools that can

133
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:58,580
help them enable or deliver for example

134
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:02,539
single pane of glass management

135
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:05,919
automation visibility control and these

136
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:09,800
are essential items in the ecosystem to

137
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,909
really go through the to really go

138
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,570
through the digital transformation

139
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:19,760
journey so to assist that journey one of

140
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:22,129
the things that extreme did October 22nd

141
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,679
this year is

142
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:27,709
to arrive acquisition so it launched an

143
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:30,558
application for the network operator

144
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:32,239
community it's called extreme cloud IQ

145
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:35,659
the reason I'm bringing this in

146
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:38,688
so X team has been a very supportive and

147
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:41,239
collaborative on the open standards and

148
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:43,729
or open community tools you might have

149
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:45,830
heard of even stack storm which lot of

150
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:47,839
operators which are you know some of

151
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,089
those are sponsors in this you know they

152
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,999
they use that to really innovate those

153
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:56,149
kind of views cases so similar to that

154
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:58,879
this particular application as you are

155
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:02,240
progressing in your journey helps you

156
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:05,860
with not just these elements but think

157
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,809
about so here is the here's a key bullet

158
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:13,279
machine learning and artificial

159
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:16,159
intelligence so it helps you gain deeper

160
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:19,459
insights into your network like and

161
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:21,949
create intelligent use cases the kind of

162
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:23,809
use cases that you can expect which

163
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:25,899
could be you know the low-hanging ones

164
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:29,089
that we are seeing for example

165
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:32,300
predictive health monitoring and

166
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:34,849
mitigation starting from the devices of

167
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:37,159
your network so I will really encourage

168
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:38,929

evaluating these kind of tools as you

172
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:49,879

173
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,529

183
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:24,169
the New York Region it is the largest

184

internet exchange in the New York Region

185
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:31,039
area in terms of the throughput for

186

I am Benson Shirley sir I'm gonna run

211
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,360
through some details about the program

212
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,530
but first often I'd actually say

213
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,870
normally there's not much to say about

214
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:52,819
the network connectivity these days we

215
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,580
kind of know how to install Internet it

216
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:57,590
turns out that this time we had some

217
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,840
hitches you almost walked in here this

218
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:02,090
morning connecting to a mattad network

219
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:09,080
with no v6 and we were preparing for

220
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:12,560
that fun day so fortunately though a

221
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,300
very nice gentleman at AT&T came in last

222
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,579
night left a football game to go

223
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,140
provision the circuit for us this past

224
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,870
week some people pulled new fiber in

225
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,699
this building basically thank you AT&T

226
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,810
they pulled it all together it came

227
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,970
together at the last minute literally

228
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,430
noah weiss pulled this network up last

229
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:32,260
night around midnight so thank you very

230
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,260
much to them thank you much team

231
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:40,270
I think most you probably know this

232
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,890
already but certainly with that small

233
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,500
font this slides not going to help you

234
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,850
that if you don't know the username and

235
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,060
password to connect to the Wi-Fi it's

236
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,720
Nana Nana even though the SSID says now

237
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,250
log Aran

238
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,620
it is still the same password so quickly

239
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,530
a high-level view of the program we have

240
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,750
about 30 pieces of content depending on

241
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,880
how you want to slice it all of that

242
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,040
content has been reviewed solicited and

243
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,610
reviewed by the program committee we are

244
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:13,089
there's 25 of us we are all volunteers

245
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:16,060
we are self-governing etc if you have

246
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,680
any feedback on it frankly anything that

247
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,199
happens here but in particular the

248
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,719
program please look for any of us we

249
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,630
have also in a small font program

250
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,750
committee on our badge but we would

251
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,430
welcome that feedback over the next few

252
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,100
days we have as I said a bunch of

253
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,959
content we've got two keynotes one this

254
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,590
morning one tomorrow morning we've got a

255
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,510
couple of panels including one today

256
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,430
talks over the next couple days there's

257
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,410
way too much to highlight and I don't

258
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,390
want to show favorites but there's some

259
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:49,390
talks tomorrow several talks in fact

260
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,939
about challenges deploying internet in

261
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:55,240
some places overseas and and some

262
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:57,550
underserved parts of the US and just to

263
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,880
sort of cap things off the last talk on

264
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,969
Wednesday is actually about DNS and

265
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,340
analyzing the DNS over TLS and HTTP and

266
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,250
so on which I believe our keynote

267
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,350
speaker will also talk about also we

268
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,650
have lightning talks if you have any

269
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:17,380
ideas tomorrow that is Tuesday and on

270
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:20,050
Wednesday there is a session for brief

271
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:24,280
talks last-minute ideas whatever is

272
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:26,170
happening here and now if you have a

273
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,020
lightning talk idea that's the URL to

274
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:31,209
use to submit we will be voting on it

275
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,550
and announcing those to the accepted

276
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:36,060
speakers basically tonight and tomorrow

277
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,140
night for Tuesday and Wednesday

278
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,479
guidelines I think most of you already

279
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,850
know but just to be clear if you have a

280
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,040
question when the speaker is willing to

281
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:46,690
take it at the mic stand there's a

282
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,410
little sign it will remind you it says

283
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,529
please say your name

284
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,089
your affiliation don't you know don't

285
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:57,490
show up with a rant disguise there's a

286
00:12:52,089 --> 00:13:01,240
question etc importantly also please

287
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:03,730
remember to be respectful the webcast I

288
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,620
think is working and the agenda is

289
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,870
online the material as it's being

290
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,279
presented typically we uploaded some of

291
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:14,259
the stuff this morning might show up

292
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:15,850
around midday amenities wise I think you

293
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:17,139
all know how to get here at least you

294
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,120
know how to get your badge

295
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:21,160
there is a breakout room for some

296
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,889
sessions it's as I understand sort of

297
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:27,610
around the corner that way away from the

298
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:28,990
espresso bar and there are some so that

299
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:32,430
for instance lunch things happening on

300
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,839
the floor above us on the fourth floor

301
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,239
we will be asking and probably

302
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:39,910
irritatingly asking for you to fill out

303
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,230
the survey the survey is the best way

304
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,509
you can get feedback to the program

305
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,759
committee we we need that feedback we

306
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:47,050
want to know what topics you care about

307
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,810
what you want to hear about how the

308
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:52,060
presentations have been going et cetera

309
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:54,670
if you if you fill out the survey you

310
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,369
will be you'll be registered for a

311
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:01,149
drawing to win one of these great prizes

312
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:03,930
and then we announce those each day and

313
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:03,930
with that

314
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,229
you
