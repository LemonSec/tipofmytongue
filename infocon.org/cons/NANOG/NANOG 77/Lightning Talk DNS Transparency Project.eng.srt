1
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,038
hi so my name is James shank I work for

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,869
a team come

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,369
but today I'm here to present on a

4
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:21,529
project that I'm working on with several

5
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:25,130
other people within this community in

6
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:27,320
the the wider Internet community we call

7
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,968
this project DNS transparency in the the

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,550
core goal of this project is to create

9
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:35,540
an audit trail for critical DNS record

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:39,879
changes in particular any record changes

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:42,649
that change the records within TLD zones

12
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:45,920
so for the problem statement I'll tell a

13
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:48,759
little bit a brief story here several of

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,449
you might have heard of the sea turtle

15
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:56,269
DNS record abuse attacks that this is Co

16
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:57,650
Talos group published on there were

17
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:59,059
other researchers involved in that

18
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:03,530
activity and CrowdStrike

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:06,890
and fire I also put out reports on this

20
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,409
activity earlier than the Cisco talos

21
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:12,020
report but not as perhaps not as

22
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:17,180
detailed on some of the aspects of it

23
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,770
the thing that stuck out to me and to

24
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,130
several others that I'm working with on

25
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,929
that particular threat vector is that

26
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,960
there were attackers that were able to

27
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:29,720
compromise entire ccTLDs and undermine

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,630
the answers that ccTLD zones were

29
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,900
responding with for for victimizing

30
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:37,940
their targets and the operators behind

31
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,290
the sea sealed the ccTLD zones are

32
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,420
responsible operators they have

33
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,070
monitoring systems in place sometimes

34
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,320
they have multiple monitoring systems in

35
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,059
place and one of the organizations in

36
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,850
particular and three monitoring systems

37
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,400
in place none of which caught the

38
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:55,429
changes that were pushed into the ccTLD

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,290
zones that allowed these attackers to

40
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:01,400
successfully compromise their targets

41
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:02,689
and I guess to understand this problem

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,320
it's helpful to understand the

43
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:09,709
relationships that are involved in the

44
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:14,689
propagation of changes to tell these

45
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:16,879
zones a domain owner or a registrant has

46
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:19,220
a relationship with either a registrar

47
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,349
reseller or a registrar but that's where

48
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,739
your authority that's where your

49
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:26,268
ownership stops the rest of the changes

50
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:27,819
propagate through relationships between

51
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:30,819
the registrar's

52
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:33,578
to their registries from the registries

53
00:02:30,819 --> 00:02:37,899
to the TLD name servers operators and

54
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:40,569
these relationships are not secured in

55
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,810
in any manner similar to like row based

56
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:45,518
access control so the authentication

57
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,430
methods and generally the protocols that

58
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,349
are spoken at these layers secure the

59
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,180
relationship between the registrar and

60
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:54,638
the registry and the registry and the

61
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:58,629
TLD name servers operators but they

62
00:02:54,639 --> 00:03:00,400
don't secure your name also unless you

63
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:01,959
are very well connected you don't have

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,689
any visibility into anything that

65
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,180
propagates that might affect your name

66
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:08,769
resources at the layers beyond your

67
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,799
particular relationship relationship

68
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:15,489
with the registrar's and behind the

69
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:17,939
scenes in the the sea turtle attackers

70
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:22,419
were able to gain access to registrar

71
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:24,819
accounts of some of the victims that

72
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:28,870
helped to facilitate their account are

73
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:34,168
their attacks rather what's available to

74
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:34,169
you today is a polling based monitoring

75
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:41,439
position I suppose architecture you

76
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:44,650
could it monitor or via your registrar

77
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,328
account what the records are there or

78
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,549
your reseller account you could monitor

79
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:51,669
there and you can of course pull T TD

80
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:54,489
and TLD name servers to find out what

81
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:55,989
answers that they're generating the

82
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:58,810
issue though with polling is that you

83
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:00,099
have times right there's an interval in

84
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,560
anything that takes place within that

85
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:04,478
interval can be missed and that's

86
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,169
exactly what happened in the cases of

87
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:10,359
some of the DNS compromises that took

88
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:15,280
place earlier this year and related to

89
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:16,989
the C triple actory actors so that got

90
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,238
us thinking what can we do to help make

91
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:21,849
this problem better and what can we do

92
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:26,609
quickly and efficiently to do so we came

93
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:28,810
up with the idea of the core

94
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,360
contribution would be to create to make

95
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,400
these changes audible and to make them

96
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,039
audible means to make them exposed and

97
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,580
make them visible but not be a pulling

98
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,460
pulling won't work so we're reaching out

99
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,550
to

100
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:47,479
the critical people within the DNS

101
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:49,640
Operations community to receive these

102
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,950
changes as they receive them so any

103
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,800
changes that they accept we want to take

104
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,840
put on a message bus and then propagate

105
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,760
out to the subscribers or the interested

106
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:04,369
parties for those naming resources and

107
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,659
what that does is it roughly looks like

108
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:12,800
this we will work with the registries as

109
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,980
our first candidates for data

110
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,100
contribution will receive the the

111
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:23,360
updates that the registries receive and

112
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:25,910
then propagate those to endpoint

113
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,770
registrants and domain owners and/or

114
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,150
security providers that would then

115
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:33,650
filter that and provide additional

116
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:35,539
context to the registrant I in phase two

117
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:39,049
we hope to also talk to your registrar's

118
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,790
and 2t TLD name servers operators to get

119
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,220
the changes that they accept from those

120
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:46,040
polling points so there's multiple

121
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,590
points of monitoring that all make it

122
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,880
into the collective view of these are

123
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,729
the changes that are being replicated

124
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,820
affecting TLD zones across the DNS

125
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:58,580
architecture so the people that are

126
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,560
involved in this project with me are Tim

127
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,770
April from Akamai Barry green from

128
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,670
Akamai Warren Kumari Matt fossil and

129
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:11,330
myself all of us are in different ways

130
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,890
connected to the DNS operator community

131
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,280
or the Internet operator community in

132
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,810
general and through these relationships

133
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,979
we've already been socializing this with

134
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:23,330
multiple people that will be critical

135
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,560
contributors of data and thankfully

136
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,900
we've gotten a lot of buy-in from

137
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,120
several people and we're hopeful that

138
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,739
things will will progress soon or

139
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,480
progress quickly from this point going

140
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:36,500
forward so if this strikes you as

141
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,910
something that you're passionate about

142
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,260
and you would like to help out with

143
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,660
right now what we're really looking for

144
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:44,030
is registries and registry operators to

145
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,250
contribute data so if you happen to be

146
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:50,299
in that category then please get in

147
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:52,160
touch with us today if you are a

148
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,400
registrar registrar backend or you

149
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,910
operate a thority name

150
00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:00,150
servers particularly teal the authority

151
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:02,910
name server operators we will be talking

152
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,549
to you soon please do reach out to us so

153
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,990
we know who to talk to and anybody

154
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,620
that's interested in this in general

155
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:14,400
please feel free to sign up via our

156
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:19,500
website to be kept up to date with the

157
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,909
project as it progresses so in summary

158
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,830
what we want to do is we want to provide

159
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:27,630
a little bit more transparency a little

160
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:29,609
bit more of a chance for name owners to

161
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:33,150
understand the changes that affect their

162
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,530
zones we want to make it a little bit

163
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:38,340
more difficult for those that seek to

164
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:40,109
exploit some of the lack of transparency

165
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,299
within the system today or their lack of

166
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:46,320
availability of change information in a

167
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,210
push model so that we raise the bar and

168
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,150
make it just a little bit more difficult

169
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,650
for the attackers that want to exploit

170
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:56,429
ccTLDs

171
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:59,989
tomorrow make their job all that much or

172
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:02,520
just slightly harder so thank you and

173
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,820
I'd welcome any questions that any one

174
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,820
of my house

175
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:13,940
Jeff Houston aap Nick I'll be quick and

176
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,040
normally I'd ask Tim or Warren but

177
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,780
you're up there so unfortunately you get

178
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,240
it

179
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:23,469
certificate transparency is same week

180
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,810
service in a world of nanosecond attacks

181
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,290
it's completely ineffectual it's not

182
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,320
progress

183
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:36,650
it's just motion why is this any

184
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:40,610
different so I guess from a larger

185
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:42,740
security context ideally you would stop

186
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:47,089
any attacks from happening and stop

187
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,530
things before they changed but in the

188
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:50,120
event that you're not able to do that

189
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:53,060
then at least it's helpful to know that

190
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:56,150
they did change right now for domain

191
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:59,719
owners domain registrants they can't

192
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:03,069
even see that things changed and we're

193
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:07,100
trying to fix that so I guess the the

194
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,990
answer to your question is logging is a

195
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:14,300
critical component of security controls

196
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:16,940
it doesn't stop access but it's no less

197
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,060
critical it doesn't seem to act as a

198
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,560
deterrent to attacks on certificates the

199
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,790
folk who are doing it are quite happy

200
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,280
that there's a log trail of their

201
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:27,439
actions they've gone over the horizon

202
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:32,260
and I'm just kind of wondering if this

203
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,260
is motion as distinct from progress I

204
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,370
see your point

205
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,770
I guess from from my perspective it's

206
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,120
from a response perspective when you're

207
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,130
running an incident it's always helpful

208
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,190
to be able to know what happened and

209
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:51,020
that's what we're trying to trying to

210
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:53,240
enable hi I'm Carl Auerbach what why are

211
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,650
you focusing on ccTLDs and that's the

212
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,680
first question the second question is

213
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,089
what sort of data rate are you thinking

214
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,709
of producing it sounds like it could be

215
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:07,490
a prodigious firehose of notifications

216
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:09,470
right so let me correct myself I didn't

217
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,360
mean to make it appear like we were

218
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,150
going after cctlds we're going after all

219
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,740
TL DS so our first the first ones that

220
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:21,250
were we're going after are happen to be

221
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:23,860
the largest and in terms of data rates

222
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,080
I don't know that we've gone through to

223
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,020
estimate what that is quite yet but in

224
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,120
general from my from a consumer side

225
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,800
perspective the people who would be able

226
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:40,810
to subscribe to things that are of

227
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:41,900
interest to them all right well thank

228
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:49,498
you

229
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:49,499
[Applause]

230
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,530
you
