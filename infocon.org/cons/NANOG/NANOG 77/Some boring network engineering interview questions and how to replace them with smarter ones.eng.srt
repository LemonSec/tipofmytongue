1
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:28,939
hi my name is cam and it's a very

2
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:31,300
interesting topic today we're gonna talk

3
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:34,250
about some boring network interview

4
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,620
questions and that's a very interesting

5
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:40,489
title by the way I introduced myself to

6
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:43,519
someone right outside and they called me

7
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:45,199
oh so you were the boring guy yes it's a

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,030
very interesting topic let's get it

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,740
started and talk about this thirty

10
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,890
minutes is a very very short time to

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:55,880
cover this topic however I'm still gonna

12
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,740
start in the story the story is many

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,510
years ago I was on this phone screen I

14
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:03,290
was actually being interviewed with a

15
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,878
major company in the Bay Area and I was

16
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,189
not talking to an IC I was talking to

17
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,930
one of their leaders gentlemen asked me

18
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:11,089
a very interesting question the question

19
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:15,140
was what's the total number of

20
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:17,929
passengers they pass through the SFO San

21
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,729
Francisco Airport every year well what

22
00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:21,649
he did not know about me was on a

23
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:23,749
professional traveler or travel a lot

24
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:26,359
I've been to many major cities and

25
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:28,759
almost every single major airport in the

26
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:31,839
country and I talk to people a lot about

27
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:35,389
their travel habits to travel patterns

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,399
so took me a couple of minutes to come

29
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:39,619
up with the process crunch a bunch of

30
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,109
numbers I got back to him with a pretty

31
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:45,429
good estimate an estimate that later I

32
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:50,119
found out was pretty close actually

33
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:52,490
amazingly close to the actual number but

34
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,709
only on you it's a variance a very big

35
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:58,249
neurone to share a secret but anyways I

36
00:01:54,709 --> 00:02:00,529
was calling expecting a trophy but he

37
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:03,339
abruptly ended the interview the phone

38
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:06,439
screen and I got the rejection email

39
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,990
whether it was cheating or something

40
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,848
else but they were not interested in

41
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,650
continuing the conversation because my

42
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:14,599
estimate was way too accurate

43
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,819
well you just talked to Ron Meyer I

44
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:20,329
guess but that was the case that was

45
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:23,149
around the same time I started thinking

46
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,069
well maybe there is a way to restructure

47
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,599
Network

48
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:31,958
interviews better be smarter and many

49
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:33,849
cover areas and skill sets that are not

50
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,340
necessarily things that people can

51
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:38,349
memorize and when they answer that you

52
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:42,189
get really really surprised

53
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:43,328
so that and also defining the bar so

54
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:45,608
where is the bar for a junior level

55
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:48,189
person for senior level person for a

56
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:50,650
very senior level person that's how this

57
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:52,180
whole thing got started I work for the

58
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,019
University of Southern California my

59
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,579
teams are responsible for anything

60
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,439
network related basically we start from

61
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:01,599
the fiber infrastructure we have across

62
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,209
the city of Los Angeles all the way to

63
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,700
VX LAN and BGP and OSPF and you name it

64
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:09,310
wired and wireless very proud of a team

65
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,530
this is the topic today we're going to

66
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,840
cover here by the way the previous

67
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,209
session was great this is a more

68
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,299
technical session I guess complementing

69
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:20,739
a session so let's get started and have

70
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,049
a look the way they structure this

71
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:24,310
interview for the next 30 minutes we're

72
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:26,230
going to talk about a traditional

73
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,540
network engineer and what it means when

74
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,608
we talk about someone who is a

75
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,319
traditional network engineer Muslim

76
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:35,650
you're referring to you someone with

77
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,339
routing and searching skillsets also we

78
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:42,760
have a lot of areas that over time put

79
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:45,299
together as true areas that we as a

80
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,048
community traditionally tend to cover

81
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,569
technically when we are interviewing

82
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:51,579
people and also I do have a bunch of

83
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:53,888
questions here just samples or to show

84
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:57,699
you what are the questions that we ask

85
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:59,049
and maybe a couple of different ways to

86
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:01,659
ask the exact same question but in a

87
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:04,840
different way so let's have a look and

88
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:06,340
say so from a traditional perspective

89
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,199
when you're interviewing a network

90
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,290
engineer are you expecting the person to

91
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:13,209
know tcp/ip or UDP IP I guess this is

92
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,879
the base right and then we talk about

93
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:18,760
something called OTP of choice the

94
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:22,210
person depending on your network should

95
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:25,090
know OSPF or is is maybe more maybe both

96
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:27,130
and BGP is a very interesting one we do

97
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,739
have some slides on BGP as well we cover

98
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,570
BGP and that actually changed the has

99
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,599
changed over the past 10 years a lot

100
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,620
through other areas that you can call

101
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:38,690
them areas of expertise

102
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,360
the service provider data center

103
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,070
wireless security advice this particular

104
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,639
presentation given the time that we have

105
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,530
we will be focus mostly on traditional

106
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,930
running and sewage engineers but you can

107
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:54,080
apply pretty much the same concept to

108
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,699
other areas so for whoever is interested

109
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,030
in literature we have great expectations

110
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:01,580
these are the things that we again

111
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,349
traditionally tend to cover when you're

112
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,270
hiring a network engineer when you're

113
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,040
interviewing a network engineer these

114
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,139
are the topics that we ask we want the

115
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,150
candidate to know the basics of tcp/ip

116
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:13,880
basically the structure of the packets

117
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,948
maybe some offsets maybe the sequence

118
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,940
number maybe some of the flags we also

119
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:20,900
talk about the session establishment

120
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,370
process the congestion control mechanism

121
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,630
is a very interesting one let me give

122
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,050
you an example when you're interviewing

123
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:29,060
someone a junior level candidates

124
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,310
something that you cover let's talk

125
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,780
about three-way handshake when he knows

126
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,850
the curve a handshake may be a little

127
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,948
bit slow start and what happens when you

128
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,410
get back a loss and then later maybe

129
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,630
more senior level candidates the

130
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,000
behavior after the packet loss how far

131
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,310
we go down we go down 50 percent all the

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,530
way down or maybe to one segment and

133
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,120
then back up for the senior level

134
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,880
candidates depending on what you really

135
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,039
need in your particular network you even

136
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,659
might want to get into things or

137
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,300
different implementations we can go as

138
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:01,400
far back as Tahoe and Reno start the

139
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:05,410
story from there and get to Cuban cubic

140
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:09,198
and then see how they use those in your

141
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:12,110
network also we have the ojp of choice

142
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,820
again OSPF an RS is two interesting

143
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,320
protocols right we talk about the

144
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,710
messaging system we tend to ask

145
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,770
questions about maybe some multi level

146
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:24,638
design LSI's and LSP is different coins

147
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,990
again another interesting example here

148
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,240
interviewing a junior level candidates

149
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:32,539
when you're talking about OSPF let's

150
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,849
talk about LSA 27 okay

151
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:36,710
now sort of you were trying to find out

152
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:38,570
whether the candidate knows NSSI and how

153
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,698
it works a little bit more senior you

154
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:43,130
talking about the translation process as

155
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:45,830
the LSA hits IPR a little bit more

156
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,120
senior I have multiple ABR's how does

157
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,010
that translation process works

158
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,400
now you're talking about very senior

159
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,560
we're

160
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,630
senior-level candidate and you ask

161
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,690
questions like okay how do I minimize

162
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:58,490
the number of LSA fours in my network so

163
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:02,270
there are a lot of opportunities here

164
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:04,729
and we have very interesting examples on

165
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,669
each one of these BGP is a very

166
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:10,039
interesting one so four major areas that

167
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:12,409
we again tend to cover one of them is

168
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:14,000
BGP attributes we all want to talk about

169
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:16,639
different BGP attributes and then there

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,020
is a decision-making process there is no

171
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,789
way that you walk in a network

172
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,799
engineering interview and you do not

173
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:24,110
talk about the tributes or the decision

174
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,440
making process then there is traffic

175
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:31,370
manipulation inbound and outbound it's

176
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,229
so so famous that I can help you

177
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,110
memorize and pass that question in five

178
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:38,750
seconds someone asks an inbound question

179
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,580
AAS path remedy someone else came out

180
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:44,270
that question it's either way to local

181
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:47,270
pref and then we have be cheap in other

182
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,639
areas keep in mind BGP has changed again

183
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,919
over the past ten years we used to add

184
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,539
vgp just as an edge technology between

185
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,479
your network and the rest of the world

186
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:59,210
that paradigm has changed altogether now

187
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,490
have BGP my data centers we're gonna

188
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,520
have a reference point presentation for

189
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,560
us coming up and interesting again same

190
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,560
thing we have in enterprises may large

191
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,750
enterprises today they use BGP so there

192
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,360
are some great opportunities there too

193
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:17,030
but there is a problem with that all of

194
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,550
these topics that we tend to cover they

195
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:22,099
go after technical depth the technical

196
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,630
expertise of the protocol candidates how

197
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:25,849
much do you know about this ok I'm

198
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:28,479
checking all these boxes and that's how

199
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:32,809
many of these boring interview questions

200
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,370
were actually created there is one big

201
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:38,919
problem with that approach and that's a

202
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:41,630
leveling thing I have heard and been to

203
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:44,179
many interviews that we talked to a

204
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,800
candidate at the end of the interview ok

205
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:48,199
there are conversations whether this

206
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:51,529
candidate is a level 8 or 11 9 or maybe

207
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,420
a level 7 ok it's 11 9 what's on not

208
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:55,310
hiring him he's just too senior for the

209
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,160
opposition we just do not have the right

210
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,199
data to make that decision again another

211
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,209
reason those traditional questions

212
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,630
cannot answer questions like this cannot

213
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,849
help

214
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,890
cases like that and especially if you

215
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,300
have two candidates same level in a

216
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,490
video two candidates is Friday afternoon

217
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,969
were making a decision which one was

218
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,270
better

219
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:16,910
well they both knew they different LSPs

220
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:19,670
TLD talks or is is they both names is is

221
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:21,199
in te may be the LS different all

222
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,560
different kinds of other says no SPF

223
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,470
even maybe LSI type new LSA is that we

224
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,979
use for ipv6 but they both did

225
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:33,050
which one was a better candidate another

226
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,240
problem with that today we are

227
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,630
interested in three great qualities and

228
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,490
the previous panel kind of covered that

229
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,920
when I was creativity innovation and

230
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:45,310
passion you all know creativity and

231
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,000
innovation these are the two

232
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,890
characteristics that I don't think we

233
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,890
need to get into a lot of details we

234
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,390
have pieces today no matter how junior

235
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,910
you are we have pieces of code that

236
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:58,939
people need to put together and create

237
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,650
something else same concept applies to

238
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,140
many other things including tools

239
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:05,209
different parts of the network so it's

240
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,270
sometimes about building something new

241
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:10,820
using things that people already built

242
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,990
what passion is another thing it's a

243
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,140
very amazing one

244
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,220
sometimes I interview candidates you'll

245
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,680
see the passion the passion is

246
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,930
definitely there he or she is passionate

247
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,420
about the brand about the company not

248
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:26,329
necessarily this particular technology

249
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,370
this thing that is broken and has to be

250
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,660
pitch for the customer that is kind of

251
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,820
passion we're looking for I'm looking

252
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,800
for that engineer chases me down the

253
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,780
hall says look we talked about that

254
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,180
solution but keep in mind are two other

255
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:40,730
ways to go around this those who may not

256
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,130
be necessarily technical but here or

257
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,810
those two and these are the lot cost and

258
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,480
different timeline comparison all the

259
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:50,569
items about them so that is the passion

260
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,420
and again boom battle appears fight that

261
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:56,090
kind of questions and just being hundred

262
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:59,329
percent focused on those technical areas

263
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,680
that we all traditionally covered is not

264
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,490
going to help you answer these questions

265
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,920
and finest qualities in your candidates

266
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:09,230
so we're going to explore some of those

267
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,240
topics and it's it's kind of amazing

268
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:15,350
whenever our presenters I have a much

269
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:15,970
larger version of this deck always every

270
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,129
single person

271
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,500
I never asked any of these questions but

272
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:22,060
I've heard them a lot anyways

273
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,889
let's have a look at the questions I'm

274
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:27,250
sure some of these questions are pretty

275
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:30,519
familiar this is a very I guess famous

276
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:33,160
one differences in TCP and UDP let's get

277
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:35,680
let's go to some details here when we

278
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,050
ask this question when we ask this

279
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,339
question intention is we want to sort of

280
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,899
see whether the candidate knows about

281
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:47,670
layer four right that's what it is the

282
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:51,519
problem with that is our ears a brain as

283
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:54,490
interviewers we are waiting to hear a

284
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,649
word and that word is reliability

285
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,689
if this thing if the candidates uses the

286
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:02,829
word reliability this thing is reliable

287
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:04,540
or act back you you black of a choice

288
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:07,089
you're not going to press the candidate

289
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,319
in harder that's okay he knows it let's

290
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,879
check this box I move on to the next

291
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:15,910
question we have seen it many many times

292
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:17,379
and we covered that and it doesn't

293
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,589
really give you any details actually

294
00:12:17,379 --> 00:12:22,629
leveling creativity okay whether this

295
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:24,730
candidate is gonna be able to create

296
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:28,600
anything for me anything meaningful if

297
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:31,209
he or she is put in a situation this is

298
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,949
a scenario that we came up with it's a

299
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:35,109
very interesting case a very simple case

300
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:38,319
I'm not saying it's technically 100%

301
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,519
accurate from an aviation perspective

302
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:42,969
but that's a great example

303
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,889
you are now hired as an architect as an

304
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,290
engineer for an airliner

305
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:50,350
and you're trying to make this decision

306
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:53,079
they have a lot of plans of an air just

307
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,899
trying to locate those planes every five

308
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:59,219
minutes every five minutes means 8090

309
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:02,230
miles right kilometer is probably so

310
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:05,559
what is the smartest way you have to

311
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:08,589
make a choice TCP or UDP and design the

312
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:10,899
system for the company so when you ask a

313
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:14,319
question like this you were trying you

314
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:16,990
were you were engaging you were asking

315
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:19,360
the candidates to start a conversation

316
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:21,939
with you rather than just a yes-or-no

317
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,740
answer or just a technical keyword the

318
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:25,480
candidate needs to understand the stakes

319
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,750
all the risks we're talking about

320
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:32,170
people's lives and also the formation of

321
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:35,199
and look at this you have two choices

322
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:39,610
you have TCP and UDP right or TCP and

323
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:41,920
UDP well down the tcp path you're gonna

324
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,209
have reliability meaning you're gonna

325
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,180
send that message you're gonna make sure

326
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:47,649
the message has arrived with UDP you're

327
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,060
not gonna wait for anything you don't

328
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:51,459
have to establish the session the

329
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,500
round-trip top time which potentially

330
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:56,050
could be pretty long we're talking about

331
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:59,079
hundreds of miles that's not a factor

332
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:02,050
there anymore but problem with UDP is if

333
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:05,199
you lose one of these handshakes one of

334
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,959
these connections back to your central

335
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,300
points or your lesson or in general

336
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:12,579
you're gonna have some problems then

337
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,758
your estimate might be off but 80 90

338
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:18,310
kilometers so the candidate can just

339
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,860
take sides and you can engage in a very

340
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:23,199
productive conversation now you have a

341
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,000
chance to defend your reasoning to give

342
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,099
me enough reasons to convince me this is

343
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,620
this is the better choice and here are

344
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,319
the reasons this question we did not ask

345
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,600
anything about the cost about the time

346
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:36,430
line but smarter candidates they take it

347
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,639
one step further they're gonna tell you

348
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:43,239
that look this is good on my choices

349
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:45,759
A or B however keep in mind we there are

350
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,399
other technologies after or this is the

351
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,720
number of lessons you need or maybe you

352
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,850
don't want to forget about this let's

353
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,579
build something else on top of that and

354
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:57,069
sort of make up for this technology

355
00:14:54,579 --> 00:15:00,160
which may not be reliable so that's a

356
00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:01,959
good example I think from candidate

357
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,009
engagement perspective and you can

358
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:07,660
exactly see the thought process they

359
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:09,339
migrate candidates always ask a lot of

360
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,439
questions they get a lot of details come

361
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:13,569
up with something more than just a TCP

362
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:16,180
or UDP answer that you check a box and

363
00:15:13,569 --> 00:15:19,120
move on this is another one different

364
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:21,128
setting always CF&I Esaias I have no

365
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,199
idea how many times I've been asked this

366
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:24,819
question I've heard that question so the

367
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,349
reason we asked this question as usual

368
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:28,420
we want to know whether the candidate

369
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:30,430
has any exposure to these protocols I

370
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,589
mean what else right there are tables

371
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:36,309
after their books and tables after you

372
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:39,100
can just look it up and the table always

373
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:41,390
have on one side is on one side memorize

374
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:44,149
it and pass the interview easy

375
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,939
but the bigger challenge there is these

376
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:50,209
two protocols under the microscope they

377
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,160
are not very similar yes they are

378
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:54,439
running protocols yes they are link

379
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,959
state yes there are these linker states

380
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,390
and an algorithm conversations both it

381
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,949
pretty much it stops there everything

382
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,329
else is different the messaging system

383
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,190
is different

384
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:06,500
neighbors different different modes are

385
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,089
different how you design a multi-level

386
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,450
network is different so these things are

387
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:13,399
all different but also I don't see a lot

388
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:16,399
of room for creativity there is a bigger

389
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,170
risk if this kind of question that I

390
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,630
want to take advantage of this question

391
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,140
and sort of expose that let's look at

392
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,839
the next slide

393
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,029
it's called bias interview let me give

394
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,579
you an example and it's not really

395
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:31,160
directly related to this particular

396
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:34,370
question but it is a big challenge

397
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,140
in our space some one gentleman rock

398
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,810
here I asked a question can you describe

399
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,610
this room well okay we can talk about

400
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,410
the square footage we can talk about the

401
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,240
ceiling we can talk about the roof we

402
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:47,329
can talk about the building itself we

403
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,820
can talk about this stage of course we

404
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:52,760
have a lot of things here but as you

405
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,579
name all these things about this room as

406
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,319
you're trying to describe this room

407
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:59,569
there is a problem with that the

408
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,149
interviewer is just shaking his hand his

409
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,730
head like this not that one

410
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:05,349
you're close but not that one not that

411
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,209
one either

412
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:10,549
so now you've gone through ten different

413
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:14,000
things about this room but you have not

414
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:17,209
yet yet that very thing that he has in

415
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,679
mind okay then what is it that's about

416
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,350
the podium before God talking about this

417
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:23,120
yeah and that's very important and this

418
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:25,250
is the interview session we go to the

419
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,079
debrief I'm gonna go to the beer debrief

420
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,540
it's called hand holding right I'm

421
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:32,090
trying to explain to my colleagues how

422
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,460
the interview went he needed a lot of

423
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:38,149
hand-holding I ended up giving him a lot

424
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:40,370
of hands for him to start talking about

425
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,260
the podium he covered everything even

426
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,389
even the start even the sky talked about

427
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,190
the carpets but I forgot the podium this

428
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,190
is like an important right

429
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:51,050
so that's biased interviewing questions

430
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,550
like the difference between OSPF and is

431
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:56,940
is like you can list long

432
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:59,940
little items that's not necessarily

433
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:04,170
something that you can ask and say to

434
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:08,490
say it's a safe and fair interview here

435
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:10,620
is the scenario I used to

436
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:13,050
well basically replace the other one

437
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,600
right so I have very limited amount of

438
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,190
time it's a research being very limited

439
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,620
amount of time and as usual don't have

440
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,870
enough money right now the question is

441
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:26,969
I'm working on a new version of IP let's

442
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:30,389
call that IP v6 point five and I want to

443
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:34,410
come up with a routing protocol able to

444
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:37,830
support IPs six point five so what will

445
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:40,020
be your choice always BFRs is probably

446
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,240
no right or wrong answer but this is

447
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,850
exactly the problem that this industry

448
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,310
something from the room I'm sure we

449
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,939
solved at some point maybe twenty years

450
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:52,590
ago right this is a real-world question

451
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,810
we had these two protocols and other

452
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,419
routing protocols the question was ipv6

453
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:59,790
now is of reality how do we make our

454
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:03,390
running protocols compatibles able to

455
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:05,070
support those things when you ask the

456
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,290
question like this the candidate needs

457
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,210
to understand limitations the time is

458
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,460
critical so I'm not gonna design a

459
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,550
running protocol from scratch always be

460
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,530
a v3 was running protocol from scratch

461
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:19,800
great masterpiece but something from

462
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:22,770
scratch we use the idea but no one used

463
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:26,490
v2 code to make changes story to add

464
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:29,190
component that and also fewest number of

465
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,080
changes that's a goal you want a

466
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,450
candidate you want to see your candidate

467
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,370
able to articulate their reasoning I

468
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,090
pick eius eius because it's based on

469
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,560
tlvs

470
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,020
till these give the protocol

471
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,970
extendibility my protocol is extendable

472
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,290
I don't have enough time so I'm not

473
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,930
going to design the routing protocol

474
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:47,850
from scratch but a better candidates may

475
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:50,010
be a great candidate would give you the

476
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,199
ISO sensor but at the same time toward

477
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,330
the end of the answer is gonna say by

478
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,330
the way what makes you think you should

479
00:19:54,330 --> 00:20:00,090
use Isis or SPF how about BGP

480
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:02,699
how about extending BGP we use b2b for a

481
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:05,459
lot of things you can update analyze how

482
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,010
about we use that for that purpose this

483
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:13,669
is great this is a

484
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:16,190
point Oh awesome absolutely so here we

485
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:18,260
have three BGP scenarios most of them

486
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,150
very famous one I'm sure you've seen all

487
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,610
of them

488
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:25,220
BGP decision-making process candidate

489
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,770
knows this or not we start from next hop

490
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,890
availability and wait go all the way

491
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:34,850
down it's a memory test question trust

492
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:38,929
me and I have seen people flash cards

493
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:41,809
everyone's memorizing this case number

494
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:44,929
two you've heard of different ways that

495
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:48,200
we use to describe attributes well-known

496
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:50,030
optional transitive non-transitive again

497
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,010
another area that's a memory test

498
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:54,260
candidates do memorize these things

499
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:55,669
you're not gonna get anything out of

500
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,850
that interview if you ask a question

501
00:20:55,669 --> 00:21:01,340
okay Emma do it is transitive is not

502
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:03,709
transitive okay what what does that

503
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:09,949
really mean he knows that okay good

504
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:12,500
memory I guess and this is a great

505
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,570
replacement again the same scenario same

506
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,309
framework you're running out of time you

507
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,200
don't have enough resources to design

508
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:20,570
something from scratch but at the same

509
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,480
time now you're developing a new

510
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:26,600
experimental version of PGP what would

511
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:29,090
be the very first or maybe couple of

512
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,100
first few first attributes that you have

513
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:33,320
to design keep in mind your router

514
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:36,799
should be able to talk should be able to

515
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,770
send messages to neighbors and process

516
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:44,120
at a very minimum that bare bare minimum

517
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:46,400
process and support BGP running protocol

518
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:51,020
and this is one of the questions that

519
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:53,630
always suggest to replace in this case

520
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:55,668
your candidate they need to know well

521
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:58,400
none a mandatory and how these things

522
00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:00,110
work what does that really mean how

523
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,510
about my BGP knowledge is it just

524
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:05,049
limited to simple laps I brought up a

525
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:07,640
bunch of BGP different aliases or

526
00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:09,470
understand behind the saying what each

527
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,360
one of those keywords really really mean

528
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:14,750
and how we can take advantage when we

529
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,790
are designing networks Noma 3 this is an

530
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,250
interesting one influence inbound

531
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,659
traffic or

532
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,080
traffic it's one of those famous

533
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:25,300
questions that people ask all the time

534
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,860
and of course it shows you better

535
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,810
whether the candidate has done this at

536
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:33,669
least once in the past or maybe they

537
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:33,850
memorized that here is a problem with

538
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,400
that

539
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:39,399
again creative no creativity there no

540
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,740
leveling there and that memory problem

541
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,900
this is a better replacement listening

542
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,240
call this for a second now you have this

543
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,280
junior engineer and that your junior

544
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,890
engineer is making a great suggestion

545
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:54,160
says we want to influence our inbound

546
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:56,590
traffic let's use the MIDI you are the

547
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,390
senior person now you are in a position

548
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:00,240
to challenge that decision

549
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,740
how would you challenge that decision

550
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,050
what's wrong with using the meed if

551
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,630
you're trying to influence your inbound

552
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:09,610
Internet traffic I'm not talking about

553
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:12,700
to a SS I'm talking about Internet

554
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:14,590
traffic when you ask a question like

555
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,020
this you give the candidate opportunity

556
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:20,500
to expose their thought process now use

557
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:24,190
now you hop and see the limitations how

558
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:26,590
definite how does the network now you

559
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:28,630
will get down to the two key words who

560
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:31,030
transitive and non transitive Internet

561
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:35,020
is a massive space with thousands of

562
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:36,550
aliases can I use something that is non

563
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,770
transitive oh maybe I should use

564
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:50,680
something that is transitive maybe a s

565
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:53,410
path is a better option this is this is

566
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,090
one of those bonus questions one of

567
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:56,440
those questions that toward the end of

568
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,899
the interview with someone nailed that

569
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,480
answer I want to use a staff great

570
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:03,250
perfect let's use a yes path this is a

571
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,890
bonus question this is something that I

572
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:08,140
think we can add to our question sets

573
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:10,630
and ask okay but there's a player

574
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:13,120
problem with that is path is correct but

575
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,830
I do not have enough resources I do not

576
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,260
have enough skill set some people to

577
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:19,780
make any immediately changes come up

578
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:22,720
with something else other than vgp

579
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,399
missing the BGP attributes now here is

580
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,130
where you can see the key or candidate

581
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,990
understands longer prefixes or shorter

582
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,800
prefixes and how they're rather across

583
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,900
the Internet

584
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,750
that's one way of doing it smaller

585
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,610
candidates might say getting asked the

586
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,970
question again that's a question again

587
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:41,919
he or she does not hear the word

588
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,950
available or availability availability

589
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:47,830
is not a concern so who cares

590
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,720
let's stop advertising that particular

591
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:52,419
prefix out of one of your circuits I

592
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,880
know I mean if you were to lose the

593
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,200
third circuit you would definitely

594
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,600
disconnect it if you were that prefix

595
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,340
but that would still satisfy this

596
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,810
question you're not gonna have

597
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:04,659
availability but that's one of the

598
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:07,139
possible answers as you see you're all

599
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:10,510
sort of different ways to engage

600
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:12,400
candidates to start conversations to see

601
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:15,250
the thought process to see if they can

602
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,110
go beyond what the ebooks is these are

603
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,690
really these are great skill sets that

604
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,919
we want to see in our candidates

605
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,020
creativity imagination

606
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,690
what's a passion piece of that the

607
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,400
passion is exactly that right I want to

608
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,950
do this but what if the engineer is not

609
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:32,980
available my BGP God is not available

610
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:36,790
let's do it this way let's make some

611
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:40,440
changes your traffic's prefixes in terms

612
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:43,570
of the length and solve that problem

613
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,400
interesting areas I am done with this

614
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:49,480
presentation and we have four minutes

615
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,520
left the whole message before end this

616
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:55,090
and open questions the whole message

617
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,210
here is there are many many smaller ways

618
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:00,129
that we can engage our candidates and

619
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,870
have a conversation with them than just

620
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,810
asking simple questions textbook

621
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,070
questions that have text which answers

622
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:08,320
there is nothing wrong with asking

623
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,570
textbook questions but at some point you

624
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,480
want to see the thought process you want

625
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:15,610
to see how they can be creative if not

626
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,710
every single two is available to them do

627
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,419
they care about the cost do they care

628
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:22,390
about the scale do they care about

629
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:25,750
things like my timeline my customers

630
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:28,000
stakes how important this thing is what

631
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:31,330
if I make a mistake the previous panel

632
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,940
we talked about risks whole key point

633
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:35,169
here I think they all mentioned is

634
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,900
calculated risk

635
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:40,270
is this a calculated risk or not if

636
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,800
something is not a calculated risk you

637
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,860
cannot calculate the risk we're not

638
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,510
going to take that

639
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,939
but you have to see that thought process

640
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:48,529
in your candidates when your question is

641
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,270
difference of the United States and I

642
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:53,299
will speed up you're not gonna see their

643
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:56,658
ability to go through the risks and

644
00:26:53,299 --> 00:27:00,260
assess the risk and do some calculated

645
00:26:56,659 --> 00:27:02,270
risk assessments so that was the whole

646
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:10,220
point I really appreciate it thank you

647
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:14,230
so much I don't mind questions please hi

648
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:18,020
I'm Chris Wood build with Salesforce I

649
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:20,110
wanted to know if I noticed that the

650
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:23,690
example questions that you threw out I

651
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:25,399
realized these are all examples but when

652
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:28,640
you do these kinds of interviews and

653
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:29,779
this may have changed over time this

654
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,250
might not been the kind of question you

655
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:32,659
would ask maybe 10 years ago but you

656
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,770
definitely should people definitely

657
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:36,169
should be asking these kinds of

658
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:40,879
questions now about automation and

659
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:44,120
orchestration and software skills is

660
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,789
that something that that you touch on in

661
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,260
these types of interviews as well

662
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:49,970
absolutely that's a great point I do not

663
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,399
have the automation of slides here but

664
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:55,070
automation keep in mind automation we

665
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:57,529
went through a long journey we started

666
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:59,510
very very basic things then leaders who

667
00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:01,850
screen scraping and just basics their

668
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:03,110
lives a great candidate if any kind of

669
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,209
automation skill set

670
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:07,939
modern automation skills that can answer

671
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:10,130
my biggest concern my biggest concern is

672
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:12,770
over trying we purchased five different

673
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:15,620
vendors now I have all sorts of codes

674
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:18,080
but here is my goal here's my intention

675
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:22,549
I want to have one configuration I won't

676
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:24,710
have one operation model how do we do

677
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:26,629
that how do we achieve it it helps you

678
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,830
see whether this candidate cares about

679
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,990
the latest developments in this

680
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,789
industrial previous knowledge I think

681
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:33,470
maybe even this wants you we had

682
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:35,809
conversations and things like open

683
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:37,220
config like yang models all those things

684
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:38,330
these are the things these are the

685
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,779
qualities you want to see in our

686
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:43,399
candidates so absolutely yes and the

687
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:45,020
solutions that you're designed from a

688
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:47,600
design perspective is this something

689
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:50,270
that can be automated some solutions

690
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,020
cannot easily be automated that's

691
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:55,158
another key point and simple better

692
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,389
network design and architecture there

693
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:58,670
might be five six

694
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:02,180
waste as she's the same goal if

695
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:04,310
simplicity is possible then probably

696
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:06,200
yeah that's a preferred option

697
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:08,750
if not then what's the right way to

698
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:17,800
automate that solution great question

699
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:19,790
thanks any other questions all right

700
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,520

00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:34,459
as an individual or my team in my group

706
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,410

interviews and all the friend aspects

711
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:47,660
gaps that use interviews things that we

712
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:50,090
can do and set the right bar for this

713
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,790
software engineering they've come a long

714
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:55,310
way software engineering now has a very

715
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:57,950
established interview process network

716
00:29:55,310 --> 00:30:00,379
engineering we're those guys fifteen

717
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,730
years ago we have to catch up I'd be

718
