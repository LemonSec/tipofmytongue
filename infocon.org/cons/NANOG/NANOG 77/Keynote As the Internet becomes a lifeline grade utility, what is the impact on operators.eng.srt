1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:15,329
well good morning everyone as I'm being

2
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,960
blinded by the lights out there

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,330
my name is Carl Auerbach I'm CTO at iwl

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,669
interworking labs we're a company that

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,869
builds tools to help developers exercise

6
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:29,009
their stuff under less-than-perfect

7
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,480
network conditions I've seen a lot of

8
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:32,610
gear crumble when subjected to

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,280
conditions that are unusual but still

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,980
RFC compliant that's okay in a

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,770
developer's test lab but it happens too

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,709
often in production there is no perfect

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,449
network code even the Linux IP stack can

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,570
be brought to its knees with perverse IP

15
00:00:45,449 --> 00:00:50,940
fragmentation we spent a couple of years

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,070
working with DARPA and rescue robots I

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,959
used our gear to introduce the kinds of

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,570
network problems one might have during a

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,640
disaster situation so think of us next

20
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,059
time a terminator looking robot carries

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,349
you out of a burning reactor building I

22
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:06,360
first encountered the net when I was an

23
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,179
undergrad at UCLA during the ARPANET

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,360
days I had a student job running a big

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,759
grey IBM 7090 4 it was a machine that

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,130
cooled its memory with oil it had a

27
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:19,590
dipstick and like all memory at

28
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,619
sometimes leaked it had real puddles and

29
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,329
they were really slippery our daily

30
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,179
operations included a bag of kitty

31
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:30,270
litter in a broom I got into networking

32
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:32,420
by proximity that leaky 70 94 was in the

33
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,670
room next RP and that imp number one

34
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,859
around 1972 I took a job at system

35
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,279
Development Corporation that's the SD

36
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:43,189
see in the lower left of the map whoops

37
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:46,319
wrong button

38
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:48,719
ok SD see it was formed to write the

39
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,240
code for the 1950s age early warning

40
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,979
radar computers the q7 shown in the

41
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,839
slide was amongst the most powerful

42
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,779
computers than in existence it was

43
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,259
physically large each machines filled a

44
00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:04,139
three-story building the q7 used 80,000

45
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,399
vacuum tubes a colleague walked me

46
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:08,639
through the building that once held the

47
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,819
q7 he said things like this room held

48
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,679
the adder that room held the memory most

49
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,069
of the code was designed by and written

50
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,090
by women the successor of the q7 was the

51
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:24,019
Q 32 only 1q 32 was ever built and it

52
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,890
too was located at SDC in Santa Monica

53
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,810
ballistic missiles were replacing

54
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,069
bombers the sage system was becoming

55
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,920
obsolete the

56
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:34,108
q 32 was never put into service that

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,159
left a huge computer without many nearby

58
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:41,010
users so the government began to think

59
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,298
about ways to share the Q 32 that became

60
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,480
one of the streams that led to the

61
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:47,310
ARPANET during my time in SDC I worked

62
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,950
on secure operating systems and networks

63
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,469
much of what we did was classified our

64
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,849
work was invisible to the public we were

65
00:02:52,469 --> 00:02:55,829
probably the first to come up with

66
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,439
several ideas that were reinvented later

67
00:02:55,829 --> 00:03:01,530
such as VLANs and key management systems

68
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:03,450
my particular specialty was capability

69
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,169
based machines and operating systems I

70
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,569
also did a lot of protocol design we

71
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:11,879
split the then monolithic TCP protocol

72
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:15,089
into two parts these went on to become

73
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,888
IP and TCP but we went further and

74
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,909
asserted a new security layer in the

75
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:22,500
middle think IPSec on steroids

76
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:25,709
despite this auspicious beginning I

77
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,659
began to live a double life curiosity

78
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,930
and a quite interesting weekend in San

79
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:32,849
Francisco induced me to go to law school

80
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:35,129
so by day I lived the wild and free life

81
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:37,828
of a networked techie by night I'm a

82
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:39,298
lawyer when I look at the internet I see

83
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:41,159
not only a bundle of interesting

84
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:43,919
technologies but also a collection of

85
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,569
duties and responsibilities today I want

86
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,579
to reflect on the uncomfortable notion

87
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:50,099
that as the Internet becomes ever more

88
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,509
meshed into our lives new obligations

89
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:56,159
and constraints are going to land on

90
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:57,659
network operators every week seems to

91
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,780
bring a new proposal to cure some

92
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:03,679
internet problem two years ago it was

93
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,169
net neutrality last year it was a gdpr

94
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,299
this week and his encryption backdoors

95
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:11,400
again to those of us in the tech

96
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:14,609
community these proposals can look like

97
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,280
a dentist with a chainsaw and these

98
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:18,780
proposals are often misdirected for

99
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,608
instance regulators don't seem to

100
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,770
understand that inspection and filtering

101
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:25,650
of IP packets isn't a very good way to

102
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,090
cure social media abuse on the other

103
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,620
hand there are issues that do fall

104
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,320
squarely into the bailiwick of the

105
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,080
internet operator community people need

106
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,300
timely reliable trustworthy carriage of

107
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,029
IP packets that's your job that's your

108
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,860
responsibility and that responsibility

109
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:41,950
may extend to ancillary services such as

110
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,930
DNS

111
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,210
the Internet is being merged with our

112
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,710
utility and financial systems the

113
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,380
Internet has become a critical

114
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:51,609
infrastructure it is not surprising that

115
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,469
our governments are beginning to

116
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:57,910
consider regulation of those who provide

117
00:04:53,470 --> 00:05:00,160
that infrastructure we all know about

118
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,950
mr. Murphy in his law that the worst

119
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,820
things happen at the worst times when it

120
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:08,680
comes to the Internet

121
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:10,840
mr. Murphy has lots of help these range

122
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:13,060
from the merely inept to script kitties

123
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,219
to security organizations run by hostile

124
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,440
governments there are vendors who ship

125
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,270
buggy often under tested products or

126
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,090
products with suspected Trojans and

127
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,409
network network operations lead can be

128
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,229
complicated there's lots of room for

129
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,760
error users and businesses are

130
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,980
increasingly entrusting their health

131
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,680
safety private affairs and finances to

132
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,600
the net users are depending on this it's

133
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,970
annoying when we ask Alexa to turn off

134
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,770
the light and she says not now it is far

135
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,180
more troublesome when an airline has to

136
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,430
cancel flights because of a network

137
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,320
problem and there's a YouTube video

138
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,450
showing a doctor using the net to

139
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,200
perform her remote control brain surgery

140
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:52,510
at a distance of 3,000 kilometers we

141
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,940
rehear understand that wrap flaps and

142
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:59,260
aaron tobacco's do happen that doctor

143
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:01,750
probably does not you and I know the

144
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,070
Nets imperfect by the way I live in

145
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:07,360
Santa Cruz our powers been out for

146
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:09,580
several days but our pit you and I know

147
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,400
the Nets imperfect but but our opinions

148
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,780
don't really count for much the public

149
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,880
is starting to perceive the net is a

150
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,190
critical utility and it's their opinion

151
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,930
that mint really matters when mr.

152
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,300
Murphy's hammer comes down on the anvil

153
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,100
of user expectations who do you think is

154
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,580
gonna get clobbered those of you in this

155
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,500
room

156
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,599
the operators who's going to get the

157
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,960
blame when things don't work you the

158
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,630
operators getting blamed will be

159
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,940
expensive so that will arise the

160
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,280
secondary game some other dude did it

161
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,070
the goal of this game is to shift the

162
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,020
blame and expense to somebody else the

163
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:46,740
game won't be pretty

164
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:49,210
it won't be fun it won't be voluntary

165
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:53,220
think of it as a kind of game of Thrones

166
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,219
but with lawyers instead of dragons

167
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:57,830
the rest of this talk is about how

168
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,258
operators can play this game fairly

169
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,359
honestly and with minimal cost and pain

170
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:04,310
I'm going to talk a bit about legal

171
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,919
concepts some of this may seem very

172
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,699
foreign despite a lot of evidence to the

173
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:10,188
contrary

174
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:11,930
the law is not irrational it is based on

175
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:14,150
hundreds of years of hard experience

176
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,159
with actual disputes I'm only going to

177
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,020
talk about civil law I think it's safe

178
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:23,300
to say that nobody here intends to enter

179
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:25,549
the criminal realm a basic principle of

180
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,659
civil law is that if Alice unlawfully

181
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,740
harms Bob that Alice must compensate Bob

182
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:32,889
compensation is usually in the form of

183
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:36,020
money damages but as this slide shows

184
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:38,300
compensation can take other forms the

185
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,698
basic idea is simple but there are a lot

186
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,550
of details and even the details have

187
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:45,650
details it's far too much to completely

188
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,699
cover in this short talk talk so I'll

189
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:50,870
just talk touch on a couple of aspects

190
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:53,659
the most important thing for you to know

191
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:56,870
is this liability is neither automatic

192
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:59,479
nor absolute there are a lot of

193
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:01,190
conditions for our purposes the most

194
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,229
important issue is whether you run your

195
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,479
shop with sufficient care what's

196
00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:07,930
sufficient care there's no simple answer

197
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:11,060
well one can sketch a few boundary lines

198
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:14,000
the first line is don't do stupid things

199
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,219
a better line is do things at least as

200
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,259
well as the best of your competitors by

201
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:21,889
the way there is a concept called strict

202
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:24,110
liability it is as scary as it sounds it

203
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:26,719
is a blunt legal weapon that throws out

204
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:30,650
the excuses under this doctrine if you

205
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:32,659
cause harm then you pay fortunately for

206
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,640
us this doctrine usually triggers only

207
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,559
when there's a chance of severe physical

208
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,510
human harm but let's not get

209
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,789
overconfident we may be already walking

210
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,649
on thin ice don't forget that video

211
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,110
about doing brain surgery over the net

212
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:47,000
and California is now applying strict

213
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:50,120
liability to electrical utilities that

214
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,339
start fires and I might add those of you

215
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,920
carrying 911 telephone service may

216
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:57,019
eventually be considered endangering

217
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,240
human health and safety and subject to

218
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:00,769
this doctrine enough about strict

219
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,730
liability let's move on to the more

220
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:03,730
common situation

221
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,360
there we all make dumb mistakes and most

222
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,880
situations are not clear-cut

223
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,160
I can't promise that they will make you

224
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,160
rich and famous but good operational

225
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,899
practices and record-keeping will reduce

226
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,969
the ambiguity and make your life easier

227
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,100
what should you do from what I've

228
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,269
observed on the Nanog mailing list in

229
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,079
the meetings you are probably doing

230
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:29,490
things pretty well already however you

231
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:31,260
are almost certainly going to have to do

232
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,660
more annoying paperwork and more

233
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,149
formalized record-keeping oral

234
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,100
communication not backed by paper will

235
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:39,360
cause trouble

236
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,459
anything not done in a good in accord

237
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,820
with a pre adopted procedure will cause

238
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:47,279
trouble ad hoc anything we all cause

239
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,870
trouble you want to make written records

240
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,420
as much a part of your regular

241
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,740
operations as possible otherwise you

242
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,630
risk falling into some of the laws

243
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,889
biggest Tar Pits such as the hearsay

244
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:00,480
rule let me provide a few suggestions

245
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,880
I'm going to skip through these really

246
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,620
fast do not try to read them here you'll

247
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,959
can read these in the offline materials

248
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,329
on this slide I begin with things that

249
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,399
are fairly obvious you're probably doing

250
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:13,079
these already the key point here is that

251
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:15,029
as much as possible you should be using

252
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:20,420
predefined and broadly practice

253
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:22,890
procedures and if I can flip the page

254
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,769
here's some things I suspect some of you

255
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:29,370
may not be doing the key ideas here are

256
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:31,529
be qualified be suspicious be prepared I

257
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,329
want to highlight the last two items in

258
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:36,019
the slide insurance and performance

259
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:38,670
baselines you need to have insurance

260
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:40,670
insurance is your backstop but you need

261
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,899
to make sure that it is up-to-date and

262
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,839
actually covers what you think it covers

263
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:48,029
those policies have full of exceptions

264
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,680
you need to be very careful baselines

265
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:50,939
are your early warning system you need

266
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,739
to know how your net behaves under

267
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,260
normal situations then you can watch for

268
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,819
deviations from the baselines by the way

269
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,550
don't just look at first-order

270
00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:01,410
deviations look for inflections in the

271
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,920
rate of deviation look at second

272
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,920
derivatives

273
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,769
and here are things you're probably not

274
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,350
doing this is a long list I'll touch in

275
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:15,819
just a couple of points your records may

276
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,399
be your best defense or your worst

277
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:21,219
weakness if you don't have a regularly

278
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,829
practice systems the other side can and

279
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:27,490
probably will use that against you

280
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:30,609
you must have and use a well-defined

281
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:32,529
document destruction the schedule the

282
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,209
networking community is a long history

283
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:36,250
of people working with another that's a

284
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:37,869
really good thing but we have to be

285
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,920
careful to avoid any restraint of trade

286
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,660
landmines

287
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,000
keep your lawyers in the loop when

288
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,149
cooperating with competitors you don't

289
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,920
want to put your personal assets at risk

290
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:50,079
do you do not want to hear the awful

291
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,829
phrase your corporate veil has been

292
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,829
penetrated

293
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:55,569
so adhere to corporate formalities you

294
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:57,459
want to have a corporate secretary who

295
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:59,259
likes checklists and it was hard-nosed

296
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:01,508
about following seemingly silly

297
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:03,579
procedures yeah sometimes there are

298
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:06,279
emergencies that require immediate and

299
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:07,810
drastic measures Alex let's go and I

300
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:10,449
once had to resort to percussive

301
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,069
maintenance we hammered the bejeebers

302
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:14,349
out of an equipment cabinet because it's

303
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:16,509
cable passages were too small it was

304
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,730
necessary but there was also no doubt

305
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:20,279
that our organization was obligated to

306
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,050
cover the costs

307
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:24,790
most risked operators is going to arrive

308
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:28,540
under the banners of recklessness and

309
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:33,599
negligence by now you've all seen the

310
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:36,189
HBO series Chernobyl that was reckless

311
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,319
it's usually pretty always easy

312
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:40,899
I almost said Ozzie it's usually pretty

313
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:42,579
easy to avoid being reckless do not

314
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:44,319
disregard known consequences

315
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:46,750
deliberately and without justification

316
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:48,699
do not disable the interface to a

317
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:53,230
hospital surgery center without calling

318
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:54,849
them first the legal doctrine of

319
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,240
negligence will pose the greatest risk

320
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,529
to operators so what is negligence

321
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,529
that's a hard question to answer

322
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:04,120
it's not simple in addition negligence

323
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:06,279
is a moving standard it changes with

324
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,709
time and context let me dispel the most

325
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:12,399
common fear you are allowed to make

326
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:15,279
mistakes a core idea negligence is the

327
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,959
notion of a standard of care this is a

328
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,240
standard largely established by the

329
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,839
behavior of your peers in our case of

330
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,430
other operators and provide

331
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,410
if everyone else has backup power and

332
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,800
you don't then you may be falling below

333
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,270
your required standard of care if

334
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,520
everyone else does sandbox tests of

335
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:36,699
updates and you don't then you've it you

336
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,890
may be asking for trouble but the

337
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,990
standard of care of all's a procedure

338
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:43,630
that was good enough last year may be

339
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:46,030
inadequate next year there is no bright

340
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:47,530
line that marks what is good enough the

341
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,300
standard isn't imagining of what a

342
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,880
hypothetical reasonable person would do

343
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,380
look around the room consider what your

344
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,870
peers may conclude are the minimal

345
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,430
acceptable practices of today that's the

346
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,950
starting point for figuring out today's

347
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:01,569
standard of care strive to exceed it

348
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,790
fail at your peril

349
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,920
moreover as the net is increasingly

350
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,660
perceived as a critical utility other

351
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,329
forces will push that standard of care

352
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,949
even higher over time the industry as a

353
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,380
whole will be held to other standards

354
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:17,080
higher standards you will have to keep

355
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,720
up you should build periodic reviews of

356
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,580
this question into your management plans

357
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,470
use your law firm as an outpost to warn

358
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:27,160
you of significant legal cases or

359
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:29,200
changes in the law charter a working

360
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,780
group here at Nanog to watch for

361
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,280
important events I've only begun to

362
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,020
scratch scratch the surface of the

363
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,720
complexity of living in the liability

364
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:41,079
fast lane things can get much more

365
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,570
complicated in passing a glide over one

366
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,160
complication proximate cause I won't go

367
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:48,010
into details even though there are lots

368
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,110
of intriguing examples there's a famous

369
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,689
case about a woman injured by a clock

370
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,330
knocked over by a bomb accidentally

371
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:58,000
dropped by an anarchist as he dropped as

372
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:59,980
he jumped onto a moving chain there's

373
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,260
another case which is city flooded as a

374
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,360
result of river ice knocking free a pair

375
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,220
of badly anchor ships that were then

376
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:11,350
trapped by a drawbridge that was raised

377
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:13,030
too slowly sometimes your mistake won't

378
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:14,320
affect anyone until events have passed

379
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:17,079
through several downstream

380
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,210
intermediaries sometimes you will be one

381
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,680
of those intermediaries for instance if

382
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,290
you propagate a bogus route that you

383
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,640
received don't expect that the presence

384
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,490
of intermediaries who could have

385
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,350
mitigated your error to absolve you nor

386
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,240
are you excused if you are an

387
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:33,670
intermediary in your propagation could

388
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,400
be considered negligent this is a

389
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:38,170
justly deep swamp your best strategy is

390
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,829
to be very skeptical stuff you get from

391
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,569
your upstreams

392
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,190
given a recent event so we can

393
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,590
anticipate a lot of pressure to become

394
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:47,020
more careful about accepting pounds of

395
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:49,600
prefixes you might also have to become

396
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,760
proactive for instance we may need

397
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,370
energy heuristics for noticing thing

398
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,680
when things are starting to wobble we

399
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,570
may need to raise a somebody take a look

400
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,260
alarm when there's the unusual traffic

401
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:04,300
shift in another common service DNS you

402
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,660
are often an intermediary propagating

403
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,160
information for obtained from others

404
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,439
recently there has been a lot of chatter

405
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,189
in government circles about imposing

406
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,110
bundles of new rules on DNS operations

407
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:20,440
what these rules may be is not yet clear

408
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:22,120
but in the worst case you could get in

409
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,430
trouble for publishing DNS information

410
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,810
that came from elsewhere this could be a

411
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:28,420
nightmare for those of you offering

412
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:31,630
recursive resolvers and let's not forget

413
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:33,760
DNS over HTTP how are you going to

414
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:35,230
analyze customer problems when your view

415
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:40,870
of the domain name system is different

416
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:43,480
from theirs there is a sort of Damocles

417
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,860
hanging over us the era in which we

418
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,550
could think of the net as a collection

419
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:51,070
of independent operators is ending the

420
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:53,729
public is going to manned responsibility

421
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:56,560
and accountability from operators if

422
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:59,110
people are left feeling that they have

423
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,930
been unfairly treated then the courts or

424
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,550
legislatures may step in as we have

425
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,500
already seen in certain areas of

426
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,980
internet governance legislators are not

427
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,450
techies they could demand the impossible

428
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,579
they could demand that route outages be

429
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:14,530
cured in one second or that we deep

430
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:17,379
inspect packets to block photos of

431
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,790
people arrested but not yet tried as I

432
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:21,970
speak the EU is considering new

433
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:24,760
impositions on domain name operators if

434
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:27,190
it is too difficult to pin the tail of

435
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:30,010
responsibility onto a particular

436
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:32,920
provider then courts may assign what is

437
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:36,570
called joint and several liability that

438
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:38,590
means that everybody is fully liable

439
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,600
what sort of things can we anticipate

440
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:44,649
being mandated onto the operator

441
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:47,530
community increased liability mandatory

442
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:50,470
insurance financial depth require

443
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:53,129
let's impose procedures including

444
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:56,340
increased documentation and reporting

445
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:58,210
equipment certification by third parties

446
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,389
professional standards for staff

447
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,900
including testing and licensing periodic

448
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:05,950
retesting or supplementary education

449
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,410

452
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,170
parties might be allowed to step in and

453
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:19,900
take control should that time be

454
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:22,350
exceeded this may seem daunting however

455
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,270
other industries to face similar issues

456
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:27,730
use Nanog in the IETF as place to share

457
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:30,850
ideas but take care not to trigger laws

458
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,830
about anti-competitive practices push

459
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,689
standards bodies to be more concerned

460
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:38,220
than they have been about failure modes

461
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:41,470
brittleness diagnostics and recovery

462
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,450
also begin to create formal and informal

463
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:47,520
links to legislative and regulatory

464
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:49,840
bodies begin to think like lobbyists

465
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,400
I've only begun to scratch the surface

466
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,840
of the issues they're gonna rise as

467
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,700
users governments and courts

468
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,750
increasingly perceived the Internet as a

469
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,830
critical unified public utility

470
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,720
arguments the net is composed of

471
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,139
independent cooperating providers are

472
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,340
most likely going to carry little weight

473
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,830
those arguments will be crushed under

474
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:12,389
the bulldozer of the public need for

475
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:15,090
dependable service and accountability

476
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:17,860
rough times for operators may be coming

477
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:20,530
some of this will be undeserved some

478
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,520
will be don't try to evade the

479
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,730
responsibilities

480
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,470
don't play some other do did it be open

481
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:29,050
and honest about the internet I'm be

482
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:31,420
honest sorry about internet problems and

483
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:35,050
difficulties openly work for solutions

484
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:38,050
you are the supreme experts in getting

485
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:40,240
IP packets from his early on manage that

486
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:42,940
expertise carefully and you will have

487
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,800
influence you now have a window of

488
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,540
opportunity to shape much of the law and

489
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,030
regulation that is almost certain to

490
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:51,399
land on you I urge you to take advantage

491
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:55,750
of that opportunity that window will not

492
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,130
be open for long before I'm conclude

493
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,950
this talk I want to take a moment for

494
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:01,450
something completely different the issue

495
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,540
I want to raise is this

496
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:06,340
as the utility network operators

497
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,379
especially those providing services

498
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:11,500
directly to consumers are going to face

499
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,780
time to repair pressures over the years

500
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:17,230
I've owned erased a lot of sports cars

501
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:19,750
I've had a slew of 1960s Italian and

502
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:22,630
British cars and more recently I've had

503
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:25,840
BMWs and a fairly new Miata the

504
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,310
differences are qualitative those old

505
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,830
cars would always have something wrong

506
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:32,200
or out of tune the toolkits for those

507
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:35,699
old cars are primitive screwdrivers

508
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:38,020
pliers wrenches and especially hammers

509
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,200
the tools we use for today's networks

510
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,250
are equally primitive pings traceroutes

511
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,810
and other things that were invented

512
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:48,490
decades ago automobiles have changed

513
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:50,139
over the years their anti smog systems

514
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,810
have evolved into really smart control

515
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,510
planes in the past we had to mess with

516
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,790
points and dwell metre strobe lights

517
00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:00,370
today the ignition control computer

518
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:02,200
figures out spark timing this automotive

519
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,300
control plane contains a control bus

520
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,910
with standardised plug from which one

521
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,830
can read diagnostic codes this has

522
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,780
allowed modern cars to be diagnosed and

523
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,270
retired far more quickly and act

524
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:16,660
accurately we need the same for networks

525
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:18,580
we need smarter control planes the

526
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,400
Internet is a distributed process rather

527
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,679
than merely a set of internet

528
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,600
interconnected devices we need a control

529
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,760
plane that looks at the net or the

530
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,310
entire internet doing both passive and

531
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,860
active measurements to look for excuse

532
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:34,659
from the norm we might even give this

533
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,209
new control plane some ability to change

534
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,310
configurations or provisioning but we

535
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:42,130
don't want to create a monster we must

536
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,629
avoid the Boeing M casts flaw we don't

537
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,420
want a system that takes control and

538
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,790
flies our networks into the ground how

539
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,620
would such a control plane work that's a

540
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:53,350
question it's been in my mind for a long

541
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,570
time perhaps we could use some big data

542
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:57,490
techniques one can imagine a company

543
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,560
like Amazon Netflix or Google doing

544
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:02,020
predictive dynamic provisioning based on

545
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:05,020
real-time feeds of web search Twitter

546
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:07,060
and DNS activities this can engender

547
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:10,060
secondary tsunamis of traffic that

548
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:12,240
operators will have to handle and we

549
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,760
need a database of Network pathologies

550
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,500
we would like some yet to be in

551
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,780
software that takes a set of symptoms

552
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,390
and works backwards towards possible

553
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,129
causes another thing we need our

554
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,380
protocol designs that are better able to

555
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:28,169
degrade gracefully rather than snap in a

556
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,280
total failure for a long time they've

557
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:32,070
been wondering what we can learn from

558
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,980
biological systems living things are

559
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:37,620
very complex systems our networks are

560
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:41,160
trivial by comparison yet living things

561
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:43,260
are very robust why because evolution

562
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,630
has tended to produce layers of

563
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:48,240
mechanisms all different that together

564
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,490
push and prod the organism these

565
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,710
mechanisms work against one another to

566
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:56,700
achieve a balance like an acid and a

567
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:58,919
base in a buffered solution or consider

568
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,630
how the TCP protocol is competing slow

569
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,270
start and congestion back off out

570
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:06,299
algorithms the goal of an organism is

571
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:10,290
not to reach an optimal state but to

572
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:12,240
survive my observation is a wean we need

573
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:14,490
network control planes that use a

574
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,070
multiplicity of methods to manage -

575
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:20,940
sorry to nudge our networks to survive

576
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:23,059
problems the goal of that control plane

577
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,740
is survival of the network service

578
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:27,389
network management and control has long

579
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,270
been a black sheep of the internet

580
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:32,970
community and we have long been focused

581
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:35,820
on mere access methods such as SNMP and

582
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:39,330
Netcom we have not actually dealt with

583
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:42,120
the hard issues it's my opinion that as

584
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:44,399
the net becomes a critical utility we

585
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:48,299
need to revisit questions of Diagnostics

586
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:51,419
repair and management with that I reach

587
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:53,820
the end of my talk I'm happy to take

588
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:57,410
questions here or discuss these things

589
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:57,409
offline thanks

590
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:10,340
ask away hi Eric Osbourne unaffiliated

591
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,080
at the point it's so in the last couple

592
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,850
of years there's been this agile

593
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,550
development methodology and I've seen

594
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:18,379
people try to apply it to networks I'll

595
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,990
be here yesterday you know move fast

596
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,720
break things and fix them which is a new

597
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:25,790
famous face book line I'm curious what

598
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,300
you think about how that sort of

599
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:31,399
iterative pushing stuff out interacts

600
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,020
with some of the liability questions you

601
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,990
brought up and some of the best

602
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,790
practices if we if some things move

603
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:40,750
faster than others and maybe don't work

604
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:40,750
the first time Oh

605
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:46,490
microphones attached here not there okay

606
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:48,470
um I'm particularly a fan of agile I'm

607
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:50,030
much I came up in the you think about it

608
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,010
first and then write it and then

609
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,930
carefully test it afterwards but do a

610
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:58,940
lot of testing as you go some kind of a

611
00:24:53,930 --> 00:25:00,440
hybrid I think it's going to the answer

612
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,630
that's going to be evolutionary

613
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,630
evolutionary in the sense of courts are

614
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:07,850
going to figure out what is good enough

615
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:10,160
we've just been carrying on a dialogue

616
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,360
about autumn self-driving vehicles what

617
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,790
is the right kind of testing for

618
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,129
self-driving vehicles if you drive the

619
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:18,320
same the car through the same course a

620
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:20,150
hundred thousand times is that really

621
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,040
testing it or is that just doing one

622
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,930
test and just reinforcing that same

623
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,550
answer because you really want to start

624
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:27,440
varying tests if you're going to do

625
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:32,210
agile development you're going to really

626
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:34,100
be think about how you are varying the

627
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:36,770
tests from one to another you're trying

628
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,750
to induce problem conditions for example

629
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:41,720
one thing we all know is that if you're

630
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:42,980
programming and see the all everything

631
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,890
in networking is done with unsigned

632
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,300
integers but if you don't say unsigned

633
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,010
it's a signed integer so you got that

634
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,020
high order bit that flips over and

635
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,460
there's so much code that fails when

636
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:54,710
that high order bit flips over so you

637
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:57,350
need to build into your testing test

638
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:59,510
cases that start with negative numbers

639
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,580
in infinitely in a sign form you want to

640
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:03,230
test all of those rollover conditions

641
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,300
and a lot of people don't do that you

642
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,070
have to you have to be really perverse

643
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,540
and want to break things in fact that's

644
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:11,510
what our company does and we build tools

645
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,950
to help people do that so the answer to

646
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,760
your question is I don't know where it's

647
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,870
going because this is where

648
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,220
we're just kind of just drifting here in

649
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,500
the courts are going to courts and

650
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,970
situations and people who are selling

651
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,260
real harm are going to create the

652
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,930
context in which we'd make these

653
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:29,950
decisions does that answer your question

654
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:36,180
yeah yeah it's good thank you okay who

655
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:36,180
else is out there okay I finished I

656
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:48,619
guess so thank you

657
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:48,619
[Applause]

658
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,690
you
