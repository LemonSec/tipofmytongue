1
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,879
okay welcome to the ietf track thank you

2
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,560
for joining us my name is ELISA Cooper

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,930
and I'm the chair of the internet

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,610
Engineering Task Force the IETF

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:24,250
the way that we're gonna run this

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:27,070
session today is that we have a series

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,290
of talks about different aspects of the

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,150
IETF I'm gonna start off with an

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,100
introduction to the IETF talk about what

10
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,410
it is and what it does and how you can

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,170
participate and then I'm gonna hand it

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,269
off to Jobe Snyder's who's going to talk

13
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,390
about his experience as an IETF

14
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,790
participant then we're gonna hear from

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,520
Agnes begg'd own us he's going to talk

16
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,560
about the operations and management and

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,920
manageability work in the ITF as well as

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,710
routing work in the IETF we're gonna

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,290
have Ron Bonica who's exiting stage left

20
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:04,030
to go get his microphone he's gonna talk

21
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:05,890
about IP lair networking and we're gonna

22
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,869
conclude with tail

23
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,930
who's going to talk to us about DNS work

24
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:14,200
going on in the IETF we really want this

25
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:16,479
to be interactive track it's it's a long

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,100
period of time that we have and so we

27
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,009
would invite people to come up to the

28
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,329
microphones whenever you have a question

29
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,189
you know interrupt the speaker if you

30
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:28,568
need to you don't need to save your

31
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:30,908
questions for the end so the mission of

32
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:34,509
the ITF is to make the internet work

33
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:36,670
better if it works better today then it

34
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:38,229
has and other times in your life you can

35
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,810
say a little bit of thank you to the

36
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:42,670
IETF if it works worse today than it has

37
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,319
other times in your life the ITF

38
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,869
probably also has something to do with

39
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,389
that so come talk to us and tell us that

40
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:50,679
we can how we can fix it can I see a

41
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:57,369
show of hands

42
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:58,329
who knows what the IETF is okay I like

43
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:00,880
to ask a question at the beginning

44
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:04,538
whereby by the end of the talk every

45
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,939
single hand would go up 100% information

46
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:08,530
shared but it looks like we have some

47
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:12,130
knowledge about the ITF already in the

48
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:14,680
room which is great the ITF is a large

49
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:17,500
community of internet engineers

50
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,260
designers developers researchers network

51
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,630
operators and others who come together

52
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,399
to produce

53
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,590
open standards through open processes

54
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:30,930
it's the premier internet standards

55
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:36,810
organization it's it's an organization

56
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:40,380
that's over 30 years old so what is it

57
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:43,230
that the IETF does the lifeblood of the

58
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,329
ITF our currency is specifications what

59
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,359
we do is we produce documents and those

60
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,910
documents are called rfcs RFC stands for

61
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,670
request for comment there's been about

62
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,680
eighty six hundred RFC's published over

63
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,630
the course of of the existence of the

64
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,200
IETF and actually even dating prior to

65
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:03,150
the IETF itself so even those who aren't

66
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,339
strictly speaking familiar with the IETF

67
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,860
have probably heard the term RFC maybe

68
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,240
you've heard of RC 1918 there's some

69
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,040
that are extremely well known out there

70
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,400
in the community RFC sixty-eight eleven

71
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,060
for our PKI

72
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,890
these are the are our main output and

73
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,160
there's lots of different kinds of RFC's

74
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,200
so many of them just have a number like

75
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:31,470
sixty eight eleven but sometimes we

76
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,390
produce standards documents which are

77
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,920
you know protocol specific where we're

78
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,470
specifying a particular piece of

79
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,059
technology or an extension to an

80
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,370
existing protocol that sort of thing

81
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,460
sometimes we're producing informational

82
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,100
documents that describe something some

83
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,930
aspect of protocol mechanism or some

84
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,570
dynamic about how you how you make use

85
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,430
of a protocol and sometimes we specify

86
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,359
what are known as best current practices

87
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,450
or BCPs

88
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,970
so bc p-38 probably very well known to

89
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,549
most of you is one such document there's

90
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,350
some in the neighborhood of 100 BCPs and

91
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:09,090
this is when we write down what we think

92
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:11,010
collectively as a community is the what

93
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,600
the best-known current practices or the

94
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,870
best way to do something the best way to

95
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,950
operate a particular protocol so there's

96
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,548
a bunch of different flavors of these

97
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:25,590
but but understanding RFC and BCP is

98
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:27,599
pretty key the technical work of the

99
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,150
IETF is broken down into six different

100
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,970
areas and we're going to cover in detail

101
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,859
several of the areas that are most

102
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,810
relevant for network operators that's

103
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,849
the rest of the panel up here is going

104
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,550
to cover today but I'll just go over

105
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:42,930
them briefly so in the internet area

106
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,960
this is where we focus on packet

107
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:49,169
networking and addressing this is the

108
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:52,138
area that has produced ipv4 and b6 also

109
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:54,568
DNS and DHCP although the DNS work now

110
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:57,509
kind of exists in lots of different IETF

111
00:04:54,569 --> 00:05:00,270
areas and also some of the adaptation

112
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:02,699
layers for Internet of Things 6lowpan

113
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,799
and LP when these are all just examples

114
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,560
there's many many more protocols that

115
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,419
get produced in each IETF area the

116
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,009
routing areas where we focus on getting

117
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,810
the packets to their destination how do

118
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:16,039
they get there how are they forwarded

119
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,629
how are they routed so BGP OSPF is is

120
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:21,599
MPLS pseudo wires and then some of the

121
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:24,029
newer work includes service function

122
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:26,400
chaining network virtualization and

123
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:28,650
overlays deterministic networking those

124
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,568
kinds of things operations and

125
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,758
management areas where we look at okay

126
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:34,110
we have this protocol stack how do we

127
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,400
operate it how do we configure these

128
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,949
things how do we manage them once

129
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:42,330
they're deployed so some of the older

130
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:44,159
protocols ipv6 and SNMP some of the more

131
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,919
recent ones include yang both the

132
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:50,610
language and many of the many of the

133
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:53,849
models net con for configuring them and

134
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,199
the triple-eight protocols the transport

135
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:59,669
area is where we focus on the end-to-end

136
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:02,759
experience layer for primarily TCP UDP

137
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:04,589
going back through the decades and our

138
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,560
current big project in the transport

139
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:09,750
area is quick in the applications in

140
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,389
real time area is where we focus on

141
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:16,229
everything application related so web

142
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:18,750
protocols email protocols real time

143
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:19,229
protocols as well as primitives like the

144
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,509
URI

145
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:23,610
specification for example comes from the

146
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:26,069
applications area that's actually my my

147
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,069
personal native area so all this weird

148
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:34,050
routing in Internet and operation stuff

149
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:35,639
is I'm still learning and then finally

150
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,349
we have a security area where we produce

151
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,879
security primitives and protocols that

152
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:41,520
are used kind of up and down the stack

153
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:44,819
so things like TLS and IPSec as well as

154
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,349
EEP and P kicks lots of different stuff

155
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,830
going on there and a growing body of

156
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:50,229
work in

157
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:52,300
security area we don't have that one

158
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:54,460
represented today but it's it's pretty

159
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:58,330
important in terms of the IDF's focus

160
00:06:54,460 --> 00:07:00,700
now so how can you participate in the

161
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,890
ITF there's actually many different ways

162
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:07,030
and the barriers to entry are very very

163
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:09,550
low so anyone can participate in the ITF

164
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:12,309
there is no membership it is all

165
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,930
individual based so if you are you have

166
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,520
an interest you know like something that

167
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,570
you've heard about that you want to

168
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,400
learn more about that you want to

169
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,870
contribute to you have a little time on

170
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,239
your hands you feel like doing it as a

171
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,470
hobby or you have employer support and

172
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,570
your company thinks this is really

173
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,520
important you can participate we don't

174
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,219
turn anybody away

175
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:34,419
we run through an open process we do

176
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:37,510
almost everything in public so there's

177
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:40,000
no you know secret closed rooms it's

178
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,050
open to all and we operated in a kind of

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,940
voluntary mode

180
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:46,270
so we're intending to produce

181
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:49,510
specifications on a consensus and

182
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,460
voluntary basis where we write something

183
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:54,099
we get the consensus of the community we

184
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,750
put it out there into the world and we

185
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,640
hope that people will use it if it makes

186
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:00,100
the internet work better we can't make

187
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,190
anybody use our specifications we don't

188
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:05,020
do any kind of mandates or policing and

189
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:08,469
we certainly can't make them use them in

190
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,700
specific ways it's it's just work that

191
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,830
we put out into the world in the hopes

192
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,130
that it helps improve interoperability

193
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,359
on the network so how can you get

194
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:19,330
involved if you wanted to get involved

195
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:22,510
the easiest way is to join mailing lists

196
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,340
all of those areas that we looked at on

197
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,500
the previous slide there's about a

198
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,169
hundred and fifteen or so working groups

199
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,790
spread across those areas and each of

200
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,240
those working groups has its own mailing

201
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:35,770
list so if you're really interested in

202
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,229
BGP or you're really interested in

203
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,929
routing operations you can join the

204
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:43,180
relevant mailing list take a look see

205
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:45,099
what people are talking about join the

206
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:47,500
conversation if you have something to

207
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,720
offer that's really like the the easiest

208
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:53,410
path to just kind of get a sense of what

209
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,090
is it that people do in the IETF bumping

210
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,480
up a little bit and level of effort you

211
00:08:55,090 --> 00:09:00,580
can review drafts so drafts or internet

212
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,670
drafts as we call them this is how

213
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,400
people formalize their

214
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:07,130
when they're trying to instigate

215
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:11,750
conversation or eventually publish an

216
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:14,270
actual RFC you write a draft so people

217
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,430
will share many hundreds of drafts every

218
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:18,110
year with different working groups or

219
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,189
with their colleagues and those are

220
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,530
basically the subject of the

221
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,060
conversation within the IETF so you can

222
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,810
review what other people have done you

223
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,069
can offer comments you can ask questions

224
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,209
you can provide input if you think

225
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,690
there's a better way to do something

226
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,460
that you see somebody trying to specify

227
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,930
you can write code many people have

228
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,150
probably heard of the motto rough

229
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,400
consensus and running code both of these

230
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:41,870
are still very important to us in the

231
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,920
IETF I'll talk a little bit more about

232
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:48,460
consensus in a minute but having running

233
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,689
code whether it's a proof of concept or

234
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,970
actual implementation or a reference

235
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,680
implementation running interoperability

236
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,930
tests with other people who are working

237
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,270
in the same space as you all of these

238
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,729
things are extremely important to being

239
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:04,670
able to develop good specifications and

240
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,320
we are we've put a lot of effort into

241
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,870
cultivating a kind of feedback loop

242
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,550
between developers and people who are

243
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,050
writing code and the people who are

244
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,849
writing the specifications who sometimes

245
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,000
are the same people sometimes they're

246
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,830
not the same people but in either case

247
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,210
it's it's so so valuable to get input

248
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,860
from actually running something out

249
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:24,560
there on the internet and at internet

250
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:28,930
scale if possible and feeding that back

251
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,160
into the design of the specifications so

252
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,199
writing code contributing to our

253
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,810
hackathons which we host at every single

254
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,940
IETF meeting can be a great way to get

255
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,349
involved go and meet other people see

256
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,050
what they're working on contribute to

257
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,690
somebody else's project if you want to

258
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,819
it's a really good way to get involved

259
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,290
speaking of the meetings attending a

260
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,720
meeting can also be a quite valuable

261
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:53,480
part of the experience so the IETF meets

262
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,640
three times per year we tend to rotate

263
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,530
between North America Europe and Asia

264
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,960
so one meeting in each region per year

265
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:02,000
and this is a really nice way if you

266
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,970
have been participating on mailing lists

267
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,620
or you've been following along to go and

268
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:10,790
meet people face-to-face kind of like

269
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,730
nano see how people interact get to know

270
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:15,430
them have

271
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:17,200
hallway conversations and join the work

272
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,849
of the ITF that's happening there

273
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,970
IETF meetings are very much working

274
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,260
meetings so it's not there's not a lot

275
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,290
of presentations like this one where I'm

276
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:28,420
just blathering on at you from a stage

277
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,849
there's the objective usually is to

278
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,670
further a specific set of work items

279
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,690
that are present in each working group

280
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,990
and that's what we spend the week doing

281
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:40,060
at an IETF meeting and then lastly you

282
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:44,260
can author documents oh you have a

283
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:46,930
question please hi it's loud

284
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,910
hi i'm jared montz from Akamai is it

285
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:51,959
necessary for someone to attend a

286
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:57,490
meeting to fully participate in the IETF

287
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:59,260
good question Jared thank you so it's

288
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,600
not necessary actually

289
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:05,080
lots of people participate completely

290
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,230
remotely participating on mailing lists

291
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,730
we have a fantastic remote video and

292
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:11,560
audio service that accompanies the

293
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,390
meetings so you can dial in you can see

294
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,880
everything that's going on you can put

295
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,680
yourself into the remote queue and have

296
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:21,160
your audio and video be seen and heard

297
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,870
in the meeting room and it's absolutely

298
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,660
not a requirement to ever attend a

299
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:27,880
meeting we have plenty of RC authors

300
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,890
who've gone all the way from being a

301
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,140
complete newbie to having RFC's

302
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,270
published and never came to an IETF

303
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,000
meeting so yeah attendance at the

304
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,650
meetings is optional it's a useful it's

305
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,330
nice to see the people you work with if

306
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,970
you can afford it if you can manage it

307
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,959
it's useful sometimes for getting

308
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,400
through some of the more difficult

309
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:47,560
conversations that are hard to

310
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:51,939
accelerate over email but it's

311
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:55,089
definitely not required so authoring

312
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,800
documents this is sort of the the

313
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:58,930
penultimate thing or the ultimate thing

314
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,880
that you can do in the ITF if you have

315
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,620
an idea you know you're working on

316
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,070
something you identify a problem in your

317
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:08,079
day job where you really feel like this

318
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,760
protocol needs to be fixed or there's

319
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,739
you know there's there's some

320
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,770
optimization that you think you can do

321
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,440
that others would also benefit from you

322
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,300
know there's there's some piece missing

323
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,890
some building block that would allow you

324
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,979
to interoperate better or more

325
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:25,740
seamlessly or in a more poor form

326
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,949
performant way you can write that down

327
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,449
you can get that published as an RFC if

328
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:33,089
you can get the consensus of the IETF

329
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:38,399
around it and that's obviously a huge

330
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:40,740
contribution from our perspective so

331
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,940
what would you do if you wanted to

332
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:46,290
author an internet draft there's there

333
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,610
could have been many more than six steps

334
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,959
but I think there's really kind of six

335
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,480
key ones in terms of just getting

336
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,540
started so the first thing is to write

337
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,149
down your idea as as you can probably

338
00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,050
tell we engage very much with the

339
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:02,579
written word everything in English and

340
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,959
being able to articulate your idea in

341
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:06,449
writing so that you can share it with

342
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:09,209
other people it's absolutely the first

343
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:11,430
step the second step and this is really

344
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:13,680
I think the most important step of the

345
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:16,800
entire process is to talk to some other

346
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,510
people about it and my suggestion is

347
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,189
talking to other people kind of quietly

348
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,689
at first so not necessarily taking

349
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,790
something directly to a mailing list

350
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,829
unless you're feeling really confident

351
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,149
but talk to some of your colleagues talk

352
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:29,670
to some people at other companies who

353
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:31,589
are working in the same space get their

354
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,760
feedback see if they think this is

355
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:35,190
something interesting that they would

356
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,019
want to deploy or that they agree with

357
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,940
you or disagree with you about like what

358
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:41,069
the best current practice is getting

359
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,490
that kind of informal feedback at the

360
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:46,380
beginning can can really help you shape

361
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,569
your ideas such that it has a better

362
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,579
chance of success once it gets out into

363
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:52,800
the community the other thing to keep in

364
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:54,630
mind is that a lot of people who

365
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,279
participate in the ITF have been doing

366
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,389
so for a long time the Internet's been

367
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,010
around for a long time

368
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:01,800
there's many ideas that have come up

369
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:04,230
more than once and that have seen their

370
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,870
their the light of day in the IETF and

371
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:09,329
have not ultimately been standardized or

372
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,069
maybe they have but by talking to people

373
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:13,290
who are knowledgeable and who have been

374
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:14,459
involved you can kind of get a sense of

375
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:18,060
whether the thing that you're proposing

376
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:19,800
is actually novel has whether it's been

377
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:23,550
considered before what its history is

378
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:25,620
how it aligns to the existing documented

379
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:27,660
internet architecture from the view of

380
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,940
the IETF community and that's super

381
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,620
valuable feedback so that you don't end

382
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,800
up suggesting something where there's

383
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:38,370
already been a lot of ground trod in

384
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,790
pass on my last slide I have some links

385
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:43,470
that includes links to the contact

386
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,630
information for all of the working group

387
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,190
chairs so this is a group of about 200

388
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,019
people who chair each of those

389
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:50,850
individual working groups in the IETF

390
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:53,579
those are really good people to reach

391
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,079
out to with when you have a new idea to

392
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,969
talk to them privately to kind of get a

393
00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:01,589
sense of whether the thing that you want

394
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:03,930
to propose is is you know likely to be

395
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:05,820
of interest to the relevant working

396
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,579
group so talking to people super

397
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,350
important getting it into Internet draft

398
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,849
format we have a specific format that we

399
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,950
use for internet drafts there's a bunch

400
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,959
of tools that are available to help you

401
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:18,209
depending on on what your favorite tool

402
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:20,219
chain is but it has to go into this

403
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:22,739
particular format in order for it to get

404
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,690
posted to our repository which is step

405
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,990
for getting it posted to the IETF

406
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:30,720
repository that helps people be able to

407
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,970
find it and then it's documented and you

408
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,010
can start having a conversation on the

409
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,240
relevant mailing list step 5

410
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,300
so letting people know that this thing

411
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,480
exists opening it up to to the world

412
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,310
essentially for comment and review by

413
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,260
sending it to the relevant mailing list

414
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:49,229
and then the last step is to nurture the

415
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:51,120
draft in its discussion so as I said the

416
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,899
ITF is a is a consensus based

417
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,149
organization which means that we don't

418
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:59,700
vote but it also means that we don't

419
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:02,010
rubber stamp so what we do through our

420
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,459
process is try to determine whether the

421
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:07,079
set of the people who are participating

422
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:08,790
feel that the thing that you've proposed

423
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,678
is something that should be standardized

424
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,449
and to the extent that there may be

425
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,370
objections to it or people who disagree

426
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:15,900
with it we try to get a sense of whether

427
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:17,879
those objections can be accommodated

428
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,650
whether the protocol needs to change in

429
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,870
order to accommodate them or at a

430
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:24,240
minimum whether those objections have

431
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:26,129
been raised and addressed before we move

432
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,900
forward with standardization and that

433
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,960
whole process requires a lot of

434
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,179
discussion so if you want your idea to

435
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,070
be standardized you have to nurture that

436
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:38,760
discussion you have to stay on top of it

437
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:40,860
and be responsive to people who are

438
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,650
critical of your idea or those who

439
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:46,110
support it really put energy into it

440
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,970
such that it eventually gets to the end

441
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:48,570
it's not a short process usually to

442
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,519
standardize

443
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,139
thing in the ietf it it takes a little

444
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:58,200
bit of investment on on the part of the

445
00:17:52,139 --> 00:18:00,418
authors so the typical path to RFC just

446
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,649
to kind of give you a sense of that the

447
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,909
whole thing end to end

448
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:04,979
there's a few different ways that

449
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:06,720
something can go from being an internet

450
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,360
draft to an RFC but this is kind of the

451
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,370
most the most typical way so let's say

452
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,469
you've written something down you have

453
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,449
this idea it's an internet draft format

454
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,860
you've shared it on the relevant mailing

455
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:21,450
lists you've gotten some discussion

456
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:23,459
going and at some point in the working

457
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,080
group there will be a question put out

458
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,629
does the working group want to adopt

459
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,399
your draft and basically what this means

460
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:32,158
is is the working group committed to

461
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:33,539
working on this thing through - through

462
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,610
to the end like is this something that

463
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:37,710
we feel as a group we think should be

464
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,269
taken forward so that'll be a question

465
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,919
and then if it does get adopted there

466
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:44,879
will be a bunch more discussion within

467
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,919
the working group before the consensus

468
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:48,240
is judged within the working group which

469
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,159
would look something let me call working

470
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,289
group last call so we go to working

471
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,230
group last call and there's a question

472
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:56,850
of whether people want this one once

473
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,879
it's in a much more mature state to

474
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:02,699
advance through to being a standard and

475
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:05,009
if that is successful it moves on to a

476
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,139
similar phase within the IETF community

477
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:08,669
so that's the point at which we judge

478
00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:10,080
the consensus of the whole community

479
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:11,580
we've talked about it a lot

480
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,418
inside the working group and now we're

481
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,399
going to take it out to the whole

482
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:18,000
community and say we're gonna issue a

483
00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:19,918
last call for comments to the IETF this

484
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,559
is a good opportunity for people from

485
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,230
who have other areas of expertise to

486
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,730
provide their input and feedback and

487
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,889
this is like one of the really crucial

488
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,899
and most valuable things about the IETF

489
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:33,120
is that you get this cross area review

490
00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:34,768
you get people who are looking at a

491
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,600
routing protocol but they're security

492
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:39,330
experts and they look at it and they

493
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,789
identify issues with it or ways that it

494
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,320
can be improved that people with more of

495
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:45,629
a routing background wouldn't

496
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,789
necessarily have known about because of

497
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:50,399
the broad swath of technology that the

498
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:52,500
IETF works on we tend to get that kind

499
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:56,279
of feedback and improvement through the

500
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,649
IETF last call process and it all serves

501
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,299
to make the protocols better so we do

502
00:19:58,649 --> 00:20:02,639
that in the ITF community we do a last

503
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:04,830
call if it appears that there's

504
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,510
consensus to support the document moving

505
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,029
forward then it goes to kind of the

506
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,860
finalization steps there's a final

507
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:12,450
approval step at the end with the

508
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,539
internet Engineering steering group

509
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:18,539
which is like group of IETF leadership

510
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:20,640
appointed by the community who do a

511
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:23,580
final review of the document raise any

512
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,279
final questions and comments and if

513
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:30,330
those all get cleared through then it

514
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:33,179
heads off to the RFC editor get some

515
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:36,658
copy editing gets all of the placeholder

516
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:38,880
values for protocol parameters and such

517
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:45,570
to get inserted into the document and

518
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:47,789
then out pops your RFC at the end so as

519
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:49,200
I said a bunch of resources on the

520
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:51,289
slides for people who want to learn more

521
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,360
we have a pretty well-developed

522
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:56,309
newcomers program lots of resources

523
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:00,539
there about getting started tutorials

524
00:20:56,309 --> 00:21:02,610
videos slide decks the DAO of the IETF

525
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:05,820
which tries to tell you everything you

526
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:08,158
would ever need to know and as I said

527
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,689
the working group chairs contact

528
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,760
information is up there too so if you

529
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,679
are have an idea and you want someone to

530
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,389
contact obviously if you're here today

531
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,309
you can come and talk to any of us

532
00:21:15,389 --> 00:21:20,399
but if it something strikes you later on

533
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:26,399
those people are good people to to reach

534
00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:30,689
out to so that is all that I had I have

535
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:33,000
a question yes Tony Tobruk Comcast I

536
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,380
don't know if you I don't think you

537
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,610
covered this the different types of

538
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:40,470
RFC's and maybe that's worth talking

539
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:41,879
about I mean I think a lot of people

540
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,370
I'll just put it out there you know

541
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,120
think of RFC's are like laws or

542
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:51,178
something you know and and I think some

543
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:55,830
expansion on what our C's are aren't or

544
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:58,529
maybe it's probably helpful sure yeah so

545
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:03,240
I tried to elide this because it's so

546
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:05,159
complicated yes so there's in the most

547
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,230
complicated version of this there's four

548
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,909
different streams and there's like five

549
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,740
different types and you can look at this

550
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:13,559
matrix of streams and types and it's all

551
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,120
very confusing but I think the important

552
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,070
bits there are that

553
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,689
sometimes we do we have stamp we have

554
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,550
the standards track

555
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,700
we call these confusingly proposed

556
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:24,690
standards but they're actually finalized

557
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,400
documents on the standards track so this

558
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,430
is your like protocol specifications

559
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,170
right then we have informational

560
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,730
documents which are not protocol

561
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,350
specifications they're informational

562
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:40,500
they are intended to provide information

563
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:44,159
to the community and yeah okay

564
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,360
we have experimental protocols which are

565
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,920
very similar to standards track

566
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,059
documents except they're experimental

567
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,880
and they are intended for

568
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:53,280
experimentation such that eventually

569
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,320
many of them after some period of

570
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,600
experimentation are changed or improved

571
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,669
somehow based on the data that's

572
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,010
gathered in the experiment and then

573
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:05,040
they're updated to become standards

574
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:07,140
track documents and then I mentioned BCP

575
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,200
which is typically as a is a type of

576
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,540
informational document but has this this

577
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,650
special moniker that it's really

578
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,350
considered to be the best current

579
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,520
practice so I think I hit the important

580
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:21,928
ones I'm not going to talk about the

581
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:25,800
screen this is good I don't know if

582
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:29,540
there's if there's some like rough idea

583
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:34,110
of the relative quantity of each type

584
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:37,649
there is it's a good question it's it

585
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:39,000
exists on the RFC editor website uh yeah

586
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,920
I think it's like more than half the

587
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,100
documents are informational right yeah

588
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:46,830
point being yeah they're not laws

589
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,840
they're useful and often important and

590
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:53,939
they've gone through a lot of processing

591
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:56,850
to maybe express something that's more

592
00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:00,090
than just a person's opinion hopefully

593
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:01,620
but you know just people should keep

594
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:04,110
keep these things in mind you know to

595
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:08,760
get perspective on it you know that's up

596
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:11,459
those yeah definitely we do the back -

597
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:14,280
hi my name is Andrew Lee from Indiana

598
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,830
University can you elaborate more I'm

599
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,580
gonna hypothesize that not everyone who

600
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:23,010
participates in ITF is a is an author

601
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:25,470
can you elaborate more on the non author

602
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:27,240
roles what do like most of the people

603
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:30,330
who good idea do and how do they

604
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,590
participate sure yeah I think I think

605
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,330
that intuition is right it's certainly

606
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:36,449
true that that not everybody who comes

607
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:38,760
as an author I think there's a number of

608
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:42,059
different roles as I talked about

609
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:45,450
earlier I think this this kind of

610
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:47,070
process of review of you know you go you

611
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,929
start paying attention to some working

612
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,520
group you kind of learn the technology

613
00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:53,400
or it's it's adjacent to something

614
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,470
you're working on so it's educational

615
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,059
for you and then also based on your

616
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,950
experience you can provide some feedback

617
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:00,840
and you make the thing better so there's

618
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:04,050
a lot of reviewing that goes on even

619
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:06,659
among people who who do not author I do

620
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:08,909
think some people come in order to kind

621
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,950
of stay current to like see what other

622
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:13,260
people are proposing and you know kind

623
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,760
of lurk and never offer too much

624
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,860
feedback themselves and that's a

625
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,500
perfectly legitimate thing to do and and

626
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:21,780
a nice way to to learn what's going on

627
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,090
out there so there's also there's that

628
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:27,840
role I think those are kind of the two

629
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:33,090
main ways I would say that that non

630
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:34,590
authors participate thanks Doug

631
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:37,379
Montgomery I remember a couple years ago

632
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:40,230
there was a lot of discussion and

633
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:44,190
thought about the maturity model of the

634
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:46,740
standards track and I remember some

635
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:49,320
plenary discussions and frankly I've

636
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,140
sort of lost track does is there

637
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,840
anything going on there I know we took

638
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,540
the core v6 standards to full internet

639
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:01,709
standard but is there a push to do more

640
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:04,050
of that or it's not really a hot topic

641
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,179
right now I would say it does come up

642
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:09,510
you know now and again all the time

643
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:12,390
because we have as I said a sort of

644
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:14,429
counterintuitive maturity model and I

645
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,660
think there there are definitely a

646
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:18,000
segment of the community who still

647
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:20,880
thinks there should just be one one

648
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,890
level and the standards track as opposed

649
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,690
to two we got rid of there used to be

650
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:26,400
three and we got rid of one of them but

651
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:29,910
now we still have two and and some

652
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,370
people wish there were only one I think

653
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:33,960
the ipv6 is the last one that we worked

654
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,550
really hard to bring to full standard

655
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,169
and it's the problem is bringing

656
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:39,240
something a full standard is very taxing

657
00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:40,330
and requires a tremendous amount of

658
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,860
effort and a lot of

659
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:43,210
people involved don't really see the

660
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:45,520
consequent benefit and that's why the

661
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:47,590
bulk of the standards track documents

662
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,830
are proposed standard and I don't really

663
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:54,490
see that changing anytime soon so if you

664
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:56,050
would like to make a proposal for having

665
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:58,870
you know changing the maturity levels

666
00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:00,490
then we have a working group in my area

667
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:03,550
the general area where we can go talk

668
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:05,340
about that but it's I haven't heard too

669
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:08,169
much from the community about it lately

670
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:10,689
so just as a data point so I was aware

671
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:14,020
of the v6 effort right and because I pay

672
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:16,540
attention to that what was the last spec

673
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:19,660
to go full standard other than the core

674
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:22,690
v6 and we did one in the routing area

675
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:26,530
recently did you do any one I'm sorry -

676
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:29,830
81 did full standard I think it is BM

677
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:33,760
well I remember the Lu D okay there you

678
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:37,480
go the one that I remember was PPP but

679
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,760
it was a little bit while ago yeah yeah

680
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:43,540
there hasn't been very often so it was

681
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:47,080
8201 8201 yeah yeah yeah but this was in

682
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:49,420
the whole suite of yeah once I'll say

683
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,770
that this is one of the areas that the

684
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,930
ITF is a little inconsistent in

685
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:55,980
unfortunately and trying to improve in

686
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:59,260
this area but for example in the DNS

687
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,910
fully 85 percent of our proposed

688
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,230
standards are still sitting in proposed

689
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:06,160
standards even things that have been

690
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:08,440
operational used for 20 years so it

691
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,300
depends a lot on the area and the bit of

692
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,550
your working group how active they are

693
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:16,260
and actually changing the status of them

694
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,260
to reflect their operational reality

695
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:26,380
would go for Deutsche Telekom I have

696
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:29,050
been participating for something like 29

697
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:35,890
years without offering anything I was

698
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:38,620
invited once once in a while actually I

699
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:41,560
think Alisa

700
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:45,939
it would make a lot of sense in this

701
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:48,700
room to say yes participation

702
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:53,500
participation in the IETF without

703
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:54,020
offering in particular with people who

704
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,220
can

705
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:59,810
comment on practical experience actually

706
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,780
it's very welcome

707
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:06,560
there are some people showing up there

708
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:10,970
and it is really welcome so people here

709
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:15,409
in the room who can actually use an

710
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:17,240
opportunity to visit and maybe come in

711
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:22,910
another time

712
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:26,180
that is really an opportunity and kind

713
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:32,630
of I think that kind of participation of

714
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:34,490
just providing a relevant experience was

715
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:38,080
a little bit missing from your thing and

716
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:41,930
from the classes of RFC's of course

717
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,689
sometimes we figure out that an RFC is

718
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:48,650
really outdated and we also have have

719
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:52,130
historic s-- but right yeah another

720
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:54,290
detail that seems that could have been

721
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:56,780
elided but yes thank you and that's

722
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:58,310
that's why we're having this this track

723
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:01,879
is to encourage people to participate

724
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:04,720
and in all of the many different ways so

725
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:09,500
thank you yeah

726
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:12,200
young youth Facebook the month I may

727
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:14,540
take it for sure you have to become

728
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,120
published at our say that can be years

729
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:19,639
and many relations with like a

730
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,399
particular revision can become a de

731
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,870
facto standard like most implications

732
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,710
following that particular revision

733
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:28,340
instead of like when the final RFC gets

734
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,430
published

735
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:34,760
no one implemented the finalized RFC but

736
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:36,740
everyone just implement stick to the

737
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,470
particular revision is something that

738
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:43,400
needs to be solved other incentives for

739
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:47,150
implementing implementers to like update

740
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:49,670
implementation to the final published

741
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,870
version with RFC yeah so this is

742
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,790
definitely a thing that happens

743
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:55,909
I think the incentives kind of depend on

744
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:57,710
the context a little bit so you know if

745
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:00,560
if you're not gonna get anything from

746
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:01,910
for yourself from updating to match

747
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,340
whatever the standard is then you're not

748
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:05,810
gonna update right so there needs to be

749
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,909
something that the protocol one

750
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:10,730
specified is giving you that

751
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:13,310
that that incentivizes that update right

752
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:15,140
I think the the sort of more fruitful

753
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:16,970
path is to try to figure out how do we

754
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,130
avoid this situation in the first place

755
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:20,150
and that I think is is part of what I

756
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,590
was talking about in terms of the

757
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:24,350
feedback loop between implementers and

758
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:25,699
and the spec writers because ideally

759
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:29,750
what we want is for these things to be

760
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:31,280
developing in parallel granted like you

761
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,870
sitting with three of your friends can

762
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,399
get something done a lot faster than you

763
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:36,320
sitting with a thousand of your closest

764
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,030
friends in the ITF community trying to

765
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,490
get consensus and that's why the process

766
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:42,620
drags sometimes but to the extent that

767
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:44,390
we can have have the people who are

768
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,459
building the core implementations also

769
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:48,530
involved in the specification process I

770
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,930
think we maximize our chances of having

771
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:55,520
the two things aligned like by the time

772
00:31:50,930 --> 00:32:00,700
the specification is done who do folks

773
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:06,620
again comment on that yes unfortunately

774
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:10,310
the time for pushing from the idea to

775
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:16,909
actually published RFC has been getting

776
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:20,889
longer and longer typically and also

777
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:25,430
unfortunately kind of the occasions were

778
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:27,950
people delayed any implementation until

779
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:32,120
getting to something that seems to be

780
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:39,220
stable seems to be on very much on the

781
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:42,459
rise so actually I would say in the

782
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:47,740
effective trade off having early

783
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:51,080
implementations and having them kind of

784
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:54,470
interfering with a final solution seems

785
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:57,439
to be in some cases probably to be

786
00:32:54,470 --> 00:33:00,820
preferred over a situation where we

787
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,610
digest about something for 10 years and

788
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:12,379
then maybe maybe nothing happens at all

789
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:16,120
or we figure out we defined crap kind of

790
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:20,020
kind of the running quote part of

791
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,979
our sentence kind of has been a little

792
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:25,240
bit on the decline

793
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:28,500
over the last 20 years and rather rather

794
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:31,960
get early early implementations then

795
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:33,730
wait for them yeah I mean I think again

796
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,950
it sort of depends on the area in which

797
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:39,370
technology you're talking about and we

798
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:41,049
are we we would like to do a little bit

799
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:42,459
more digging on the timeliness of things

800
00:33:41,049 --> 00:33:44,799
this is something that the leadership

801
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,000
has talked about a bit so we're hoping

802
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,918
to get more clarity on whether it

803
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,539
actually is taking longer or shorter I

804
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,620
don't think it's really obvious I think

805
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:51,610
we'll take one more and then we're gonna

806
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,770
move on

807
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,870
sure so Mike McBride as a working group

808
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:58,270
as an IETF working group chair we're in

809
00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:00,189
the process of moving a specific draft

810
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:01,840
from proposed to an or to Internet

811
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:05,500
standard and your comments got me

812
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,750
thinking of reaching out to the Nana

813
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,300
community in this process and due

814
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:13,540
diligence to make sure that maybe some

815
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,950
way certain pieces of that protocol may

816
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,500
or may not being being used and things

817
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:19,388
like that so I guess my question to you

818
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:23,379
and the community is is it appropriate

819
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:25,179
for a working group like an idea for

820
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:30,009
group to reach out to Nana community to

821
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:32,200
email you to get to specify a survey tab

822
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:34,240
you can answer just a few questions as

823
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:36,368
we move a draft from proposed to

824
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,770
internet so the survey is an interesting

825
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:41,649
idea I mean I think the the outreach is

826
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:44,290
certainly like most welcome like please

827
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:45,879
do that that seems like a great idea I

828
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:49,000
think in the past but typically we've

829
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:50,469
tried to bring people into whatever the

830
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,359
working group process was to say hey

831
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:54,189
like this is gonna go to last call

832
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:56,679
like please chime in on this list if you

833
00:34:54,190 --> 00:35:00,580
have ideas but we have had individuals

834
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:02,770
who took an initiative to to run small

835
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,210
surveys or larger surveys to try to get

836
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,190
operate or feedback so there's some

837
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,890
precedent for doing that and I think

838
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,630
it's it's definitely feasible so happy

839
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:13,618
to follow up on the specifics if you

840
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:15,070
want to yeah all right why don't we

841
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,370
thank you

842
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:22,790
[Music]

843
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:22,790
[Applause]

844
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:31,130
it works nice

845
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,980
my name is job Snider's and I would want

846
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:36,380
to share with you some of my experiences

847
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:39,410
where my career in networking and the

848
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:43,540
ITF were intertwined in interesting ways

849
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:48,230
and perhaps these stories will inspire

850
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:50,750
younger people to participate in ITF so

851
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:53,480
not many people notice but in my early

852
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:55,339
20s I ran into this network service

853
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:59,690
provider in the Netherlands and they

854
00:35:55,339 --> 00:36:02,240
said that this MPLS problem so that

855
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:04,160
evening I looked on Wikipedia what MPLS

856
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,810
was and the next day I did a job

857
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:10,460
interview with them and I said we got

858
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:12,650
this and somehow I figured out their

859
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,960
issue and remained there as a network

860
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:17,329
engineer and throughout my searches of

861
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,520
how the infinite actually worked I was

862
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:22,430
googling for phrases of what's the next

863
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,770
new thing after MPLS we mastered this we

864
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:28,210
got a deployed what's the next hardest

865
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:31,940
thing and of course

866
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:34,550
mi-jung interpretation of the world that

867
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:39,920
was Lisp it had all these crazy features

868
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:42,069
like fee for or 56 v6 Oh 54 mobility it

869
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,020
would read loose the the routing tables

870
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:48,109
and I became very very interested in

871
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:51,589
this experiment that was going on and I

872
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:54,560
thought I should be part of that so I

873
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:58,119
dug up my first email I ever sent to the

874
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:05,900
ITF and I'll show it in my next slide

875
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:08,660
help this went to the ITF that work I

876
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,310
was thinking this was a mill robot but

877
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:16,440
it turned out to be a distribution list

878
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:20,549
too many people a second attempt

879
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:23,070
and actually this was a wonderful

880
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:24,990
experience Lisp is not the popular

881
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:27,690
protocol that we envisioned it would be

882
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:30,390
in the context of internet routing but

883
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:33,150
throughout this experience I got to

884
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:37,020
watch how protocol developments actually

885
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:40,470
worked I got to look at excellent role

886
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:43,290
models such as Dino the infant inventor

887
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:47,520
of GRE and David Meyer who were

888
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:51,380
extremely kind in guiding my young naive

889
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:52,950
Minds towards productive outcomes so

890
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:56,010
totally worth it

891
00:37:52,950 --> 00:38:00,960
despite Lisp not being my poor job

892
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:04,080
anymore then the second watcher

893
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:08,490
interaction with ITF was large bgp

894
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:11,700
communities in early 2016 this fine

895
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:14,549
gentleman Ignace stood up at a network

896
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:17,609
meeting and he explained to the audience

897
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:20,970
that is really challenging to fit 32-bit

898
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:23,100
values into a 16-bit finials and we

899
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:25,680
looked at it from different angles and

900
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:29,630
no matter how we try it would not fit

901
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:32,399
and in that meeting I was like you know

902
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:34,410
darn it we can just do this let's go to

903
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,920
idea let's specify something that is

904
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:40,500
useful because we saw 4-byte asn the the

905
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,350
use of 4-byte asn s go up the pool of

906
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,760
two byte ASNs go down and it was clear

907
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,920
that at some point there would be a

908
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:50,400
collision between scarcity of resources

909
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:53,270
and the needs of operators and it seems

910
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:57,180
entirely feasible to to pull this off so

911
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:59,100
we set out with a simple idea let's make

912
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:03,870
the bgp community just a little bit

913
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:07,049
bigger and it actually was quite a

914
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:09,960
challenging process not necessarily for

915
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:12,120
ITF but more for myself because

916
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,460
everybody that had a comments or

917
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:17,069
objectives i took that very personal and

918
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:21,750
i added them to my enemy list like you

919
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:23,580
guys how can you not see the truth but

920
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,830
we railroaded it through

921
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,840
we called our friends who a financial

922
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:31,880
spent with the

923
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:33,770
like cisco juniper nokia Arista we sent

924
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,040
patches to open-source projects so we

925
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:40,600
could point at running codes and we

926
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:43,100
developed an operational rough consensus

927
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:45,589
and this was a very interesting project

928
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:48,799
because we went at it as fast as ITF

929
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:50,990
essentially can go and that meant that

930
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,170
the RFC was published in less than a

931
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:57,439
year which is impressive

932
00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:00,140
we got running codes fairly quickly from

933
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,080
the vendors a year after and now we can

934
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:05,420
finally see this feature come into the

935
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,520
ecosystem I checked today there were

936
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:11,030
2,000 prefixes with large communities

937
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:13,580
from 500 different agents so we're kind

938
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:16,580
of on track with mister folks prediction

939
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:22,549
that if we go as fast as we can in five

940
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:25,730
years we have this so great experience

941
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:29,390
and my personal reflection on some of

942
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:33,230
this is that perhaps at times it was not

943
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:35,420
necessary to become as upset as I became

944
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:40,250
at times because some of the things are

945
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:42,110
unavoidable and will happen anyway what

946
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:44,450
I also observed is that this ITF

947
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:47,780
participation actually in a positive way

948
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:49,520
helped kickstart my career it was very

949
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,920
interesting to be on the forefront of

950
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,330
how things work speak with developers

951
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,180
speak with architects from other

952
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:59,540
networks and at no point was there a

953
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:01,879
downside to to my career so to young

954
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,580
people is something to take in mind take

955
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:08,060
into consideration if you're planning

956
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:10,370
out the next 10 years ITF can be a good

957
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:14,360
way to meet people that can help you get

958
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:16,790
new jobs and I also discovered that it

959
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:19,880
is perfectly possible to disagree about

960
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:22,610
one project and agree about other

961
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,920
projects so as the years went by I am

962
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:26,870
slowly removing people from the name is

963
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,870
shameless on my computer and actually

964
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:34,250
discovering that collaboration in fact

965
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:36,080
often is very productive everybody

966
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,630
brings unique knowledge and experiences

967
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,990
to the table and yes we sometimes

968
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,740
disagree

969
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:46,200
that's okay that's part of it we should

970
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,899
also recognize that ITF has many

971
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,819
products so to speak they're not really

972
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:54,330
products but their specs but if we view

973
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:56,460
it as a company that produces things it

974
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:58,380
has some high quality awesome products

975
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:02,790
and there are some things that turn out

976
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:05,400
to be less optimal I'm a big fan of BGP

977
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:07,589
it's still running after all these years

978
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,420
it's still being extended we're still

979
00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:12,330
fine-tuning it it's still meeting our

980
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:15,540
operational needs and it's a very very

981
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:18,299
impressive effort but we also produce

982
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:21,390
other protocols where different choices

983
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:24,180
were made at times and this is the ITF

984
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:26,879
it's multifaceted we cannot say the ITF

985
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:29,040
is good or the ITF there is mad the ITF

986
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,680
is this sort of engine that churns

987
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,220
through things and garbage in means

988
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:40,890
garbage out and that's how the processes

989
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:43,649
designs now if I look at my future

990
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:46,230
trajectory in recognizing that we

991
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:49,440
ourselves have a role in ITF and that we

992
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:51,630
cannot point blame at ITF or say why

993
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,880
were large communities not invented

994
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:55,830
earlier the only reason those things

995
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,220
didn't have a layer or they didn't

996
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:02,369
happen conforming to your requirements

997
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:05,839
is perhaps because of lack of

998
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:08,820
participation so I joined the Borg

999
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:11,339
became a chair of the grow working group

1000
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:15,720
which is the nicest working group we

1001
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:19,130
have volunteered for the NomCom the

1002
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,240
NomCom is the group that will help

1003
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:24,480
[Music]

1004
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:28,470
appoint or influence appointments of the

1005
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,810
ITF leadership so in this way we have a

1006
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:33,629
capacity to steer where the organisation

1007
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:36,869
actually is going and from time to time

1008
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:39,480
people come to me and say hey I want to

1009
00:43:36,869 --> 00:43:41,310
go to an ITF meeting can I tag along as

1010
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,300
your mentee will you introduce me to

1011
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:48,960
people will you explain processes and

1012
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:50,849
include me in this community and this is

1013
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,039
what I'm currently doing

1014
00:43:50,849 --> 00:43:55,900
happy with those developments and I

1015
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:58,749
would strongly encourage others to

1016
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:01,420
follow suit and consider where it is

1017
00:43:58,749 --> 00:44:03,729
they themselves can participate what are

1018
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:05,950
the itches you have in your daily

1019
00:44:03,729 --> 00:44:08,468
operations where you think hey if we

1020
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:08,859
tune this thing just a little bit to the

1021
00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:11,710
left

1022
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:15,759
everything comes better and that's where

1023
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:19,539
ITF can be helpful and be fun and

1024
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:22,119
enjoyable this brings me to the end of

1025
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:28,619
my slides if you have questions comments

1026
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:28,619
please approach me now or email me later

1027
00:44:32,009 --> 00:44:54,219
no questions everybody joined the Gros

1028
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:55,630
working group hi I'm Veronica and I'd

1029
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:59,140
like to talk a little bit about the int

1030
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:02,410
working group several years ago I was on

1031
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:04,598
the IES Jay was the ad for the option

1032
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:07,989
management working group and I remember

1033
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:10,569
the nth ad talking about the int area

1034
00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:13,329
charter the fellow stood up in front of

1035
00:45:10,569 --> 00:45:14,979
the iesg and said the anti areas Charter

1036
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:17,619
is to make the internet more better more

1037
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:18,098
good and I thought about that for a

1038
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:20,499
while

1039
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:26,829
and in a way he was right and in a way

1040
00:45:20,499 --> 00:45:28,988
he was wrong the int area has a formal

1041
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:33,279
charter here and it has directors suresh

1042
00:45:28,989 --> 00:45:36,430
krisshnan inherent Vinc it owns the

1043
00:45:33,279 --> 00:45:38,200
forwarding plane it owns ipv4 taken care

1044
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:41,649
of in the int area working group at owns

1045
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:45,299
ipv6 maintenance taken care of in the

1046
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:48,549
six-man working group it also owns a

1047
00:45:45,299 --> 00:45:50,650
couple of protocols that are absolutely

1048
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:53,109
essential to the operation of the

1049
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:55,029
internet application layer protocols

1050
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:57,369
that are absolutely essential to the

1051
00:45:55,029 --> 00:45:58,770
operation of the internet I'm thinking

1052
00:45:57,369 --> 00:46:03,119
of DNS

1053
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:07,410
I'm thinking of DHCP I'm thinking of NDP

1054
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:09,990
without those there would be no

1055
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:13,259
functional internet it also owns some

1056
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:16,259
other some other protocols like soft

1057
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:18,920
white soft wire and a few others around

1058
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,920
the edges

1059
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:26,130
informal charter I guess I just went

1060
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:29,549
over that in the last line there are a

1061
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:31,950
bunch of active working groups some that

1062
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:35,190
I haven't mentioned like ipv6 over

1063
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:38,848
Network ipv6 over networks of resource

1064
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:42,740
constraint nodes six low six tisch but

1065
00:46:38,849 --> 00:46:44,910
most of them are around things like DNS

1066
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:47,598
DHCP the things that are absolutely

1067
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:51,480
essential

1068
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:54,869
I'll go first make a disclaimer the int

1069
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:58,080
area covers a huge problem space each

1070
00:46:54,869 --> 00:47:00,630
part of the problem space is an area of

1071
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:03,359
interest for a unique community there's

1072
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:04,980
a wireline mobile line there are wild

1073
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:07,580
line mobile cloud and Enterprise

1074
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:10,310
operators constrained network operators

1075
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:14,040
special purpose and operators like

1076
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:17,630
vehicular networks and the following

1077
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:21,450
slides introduce a couple working groups

1078
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:24,960
one of them is six-man it's responsible

1079
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:27,569
for ipv6 maintenance right now they're

1080
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,950
working on ipv6 data plane for segment

1081
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:32,099
routing there are a couple drafts in

1082
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:34,770
their extension header limits MTU

1083
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:37,349
discovery you'll also find interesting

1084
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:41,550
debates in there about extensions to

1085
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:47,640
slack occasionally VIN interactions

1086
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:50,540
between slack and DHCP there's the

1087
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:55,109
dynamic host configuration working group

1088
00:47:50,540 --> 00:48:02,359
it is in charge in charge of things like

1089
00:47:55,109 --> 00:48:02,359
dhcpv6 and everything around that

1090
00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:10,200
DNS private exchange deprived dns pry

1091
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:12,180
forking group develops mechanisms to

1092
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,730
provide confidentiality and DNS

1093
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:17,250
transactions in order to address

1094
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:21,450
concerns surrounding pervasive

1095
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:26,490
monitoring an interesting one to people

1096
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:30,269
in this and this area not operators also

1097
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:32,930
home net they talk about requirements

1098
00:48:30,269 --> 00:48:35,490
for home networking networks that no

1099
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:39,779
more than a trivial home network more

1100
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:42,209
than a few routers behind a few hosts

1101
00:48:39,779 --> 00:48:46,160
behind a router they also spun off

1102
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:48,539
routing area working group called Babel

1103
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,640
and then there's the int area working

1104
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:53,779
group the entire area working group is

1105
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:56,279
kind of a catch-all it takes care about

1106
00:48:53,779 --> 00:48:58,319
operational architectural advice things

1107
00:48:56,279 --> 00:49:00,930
like fragmentation considered fragment

1108
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:04,380
fragile IP tunnels and the internet

1109
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:07,319
architecture new encapsulations like goo

1110
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:10,200
although there's another working group

1111
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:11,490
and routing and vo3 that also talks

1112
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:16,980
about encapsulations

1113
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:19,979
and new OEM and mechanisms things like

1114
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:24,660
ICMP probe ICMP extensions for

1115
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:27,930
unnumbered interfaces there's been a

1116
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:29,839
very small overview of the nth area but

1117
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:34,140
I'd like to make a general comment about

1118
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:36,180
the internet area when a network

1119
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:38,490
operator I'm going to compete with Agnes

1120
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:41,788
for just a second of to get your

1121
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:46,019
attention when a network operator looks

1122
00:49:41,789 --> 00:49:48,599
at the IETF and decides what area to

1123
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:51,180
become involved in it's very natural to

1124
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:52,980
for him to become involved in the option

1125
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,868
management area of course I'm an

1126
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:57,329
operator the ops area is the place to be

1127
00:49:54,869 --> 00:50:00,480
that's how I first became involved in

1128
00:49:57,329 --> 00:50:02,730
the IETF and the option management area

1129
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,069
and over time I was director of the ops

1130
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:09,509
and management area for some number of

1131
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:12,850
years as it turns out you can't have the

1132
00:50:09,509 --> 00:50:16,600
best expertise to

1133
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:18,850
and form and direct the antaria you

1134
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:22,180
understand how protocols actually

1135
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:27,069
operate how they scale how they interact

1136
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:29,319
with each other how they fail because of

1137
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:34,030
that your input is really really

1138
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:35,860
important to all the to six-man to the

1139
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:41,230
dns for those of you who are DNS

1140
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:43,120
operators to the DNS working groups so

1141
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:45,760
the dynamic host configuration working

1142
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:49,120
groups so please do take a look at the

1143
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:51,640
in Treo when you decide which working

1144
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:57,960
groups to monitor and where to review

1145
00:50:51,640 --> 00:51:04,658
drafts any questions well thanks

1146
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:04,659
[Applause]

1147
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:16,220
hello that I mean cosmic donors and I'm

1148
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:17,960
one of the area directors in IETF and my

1149
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:20,899
direct responsibility is in the

1150
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:23,990
operations and management area so a

1151
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:26,450
quick overview of what is happening

1152
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:27,979
there and how that is relevant or

1153
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:30,200
possibly relevant and interesting to

1154
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:34,910
what you are doing here and at the same

1155
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:37,250
time a call for help of feedback and

1156
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:40,848
information of what you see in your

1157
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:42,859
field what possibly is missing or wrong

1158
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:47,780
and how could you provide that

1159
00:51:42,859 --> 00:51:51,190
information into the idea so operation

1160
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:54,800
Syria well it has one name in fact those

1161
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:56,930
more like two sub areas in that one that

1162
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,910
deals with operational aspects and the

1163
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:01,040
other that deals with manageability

1164
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:04,129
aspects and I wouldn't say that there is

1165
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:10,040
a lot of intersection between those two

1166
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:13,640
parts quickly looking into what's the OP

1167
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:16,369
C area deals in overall of Syria deals

1168
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:20,569
with the deployment aspects of the IETF

1169
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:24,099
deliverables and it is about the usage

1170
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:26,089
of certain groups of protocols

1171
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:28,310
developing best practices or

1172
00:52:26,089 --> 00:52:30,549
recommendations of how to deal with

1173
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:34,580
those protocols how to deploy them and

1174
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:36,619
then a large part of the work is

1175
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:40,509
dedicated to the evolution of a network

1176
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:43,520
manageability one important note to

1177
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:46,040
remember and this is what I personally

1178
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:49,520
hear quite often from the people when

1179
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:52,869
new to the IDF is why ITF doesn't work

1180
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:55,070
on standardizing this particular

1181
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:58,430
architecture for this deployment model

1182
00:52:55,070 --> 00:53:00,290
or something along those lines ITF as an

1183
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:02,149
organisation is good at working on

1184
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:05,599
components and technologies basically

1185
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:08,540
fragments and it's not necessarily the

1186
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,609
right place for dealing with how G you

1187
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:13,160
man how do you bind those components

1188
00:53:10,609 --> 00:53:14,869
together and build a solution one part

1189
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,368
of that is that a lot of this is

1190
00:53:14,869 --> 00:53:19,310
dependent on vendors and vendor

1191
00:53:16,369 --> 00:53:22,099
implementations and ITF is not a place

1192
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:26,029
which controls the vendors data aspect

1193
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:27,710
is that it is you as an operator or in

1194
00:53:26,029 --> 00:53:30,410
an architect role within an operator you

1195
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:32,089
take those components and provided that

1196
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:34,700
you have enough information about how

1197
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:37,328
those components work it is you who are

1198
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:40,689
building that and to end solution and

1199
00:53:37,329 --> 00:53:43,039
let's look realistically each of yours

1200
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:45,920
one of your networks is different than

1201
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:48,799
the others and for it would be difficult

1202
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,960
to try to define some sort of kind of

1203
00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:53,809
general best practice of architectural

1204
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:57,170
recommendations that would be applicable

1205
00:53:53,809 --> 00:53:59,450
in a more general sense so what's inside

1206
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:02,930
of the ops II area

1207
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:05,479
a very brief overview and then if if

1208
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:07,549
you're interested you might take more

1209
00:54:05,479 --> 00:54:09,069
detailed look following the links

1210
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:12,529
provided

1211
00:54:09,069 --> 00:54:17,619
autonomic networking animal that's an

1212
00:54:12,529 --> 00:54:19,999
area which probably produces certain

1213
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:25,039
protocols and specifications which might

1214
00:54:19,999 --> 00:54:27,439
look rather fascinating imagine a

1215
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:29,930
situation you take the box unbox the

1216
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,719
router plug the power in plug the cable

1217
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:35,450
into matching color socket and after

1218
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:36,829
some time that router boots up and it is

1219
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:38,569
visible in your network management

1220
00:54:36,829 --> 00:54:42,650
systems and is becoming more or less

1221
00:54:38,569 --> 00:54:44,619
operational how do you bootstrap such a

1222
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:48,349
network with an almost live about

1223
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:49,849
operator touching that in doing the

1224
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:52,460
secure bootstrap how do you validate

1225
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:54,469
that the device which you are booting is

1226
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:56,630
actually the device which you are

1227
00:54:54,469 --> 00:54:59,029
supposed to be and not not something

1228
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:01,190
like pretending it to be and things like

1229
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:04,940
that zero touch provisioning how you

1230
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:08,809
enable new devices operating in and ever

1231
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:10,940
without touching those benchmarking now

1232
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:13,279
looking at a methodology not a bench

1233
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:15,559
making and not looking into which vendor

1234
00:55:13,279 --> 00:55:17,479
has a fastest router but that's about a

1235
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:20,989
methodology of how do you measure the

1236
00:55:17,479 --> 00:55:23,509
things if you of the working groups like

1237
00:55:20,989 --> 00:55:27,390
diamond radix they are dedicated to the

1238
00:55:23,509 --> 00:55:29,220
maintenance of important

1239
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:32,538
chuckles which have been widely deployed

1240
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:36,720
and still I deployed diameter and radius

1241
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:39,089
DNS operations dealing with the topics

1242
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,950
related to the deployment and running

1243
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:44,369
operational aspects of a DNS

1244
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:46,500
infrastructure job the most important

1245
00:55:44,369 --> 00:55:51,049
working group of the whole IETF is in OP

1246
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:55,289
Syria that's where the discussions about

1247
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:59,190
the topics related to the operation of a

1248
00:55:55,289 --> 00:56:02,369
global routing in infrastructure the

1249
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:05,609
deployment aspects of multicast mbone D

1250
00:56:02,369 --> 00:56:09,660
deriving its name from am bone and

1251
00:56:05,609 --> 00:56:13,650
experiment of several decades ago now

1252
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:17,609
two areas to two working groups which

1253
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:21,240
are both active and personally for me

1254
00:56:17,609 --> 00:56:24,029
very interesting NAT Cornett mod this is

1255
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:25,769
where the evolution of the network

1256
00:56:24,029 --> 00:56:29,190
manageability happens and we will talk

1257
00:56:25,769 --> 00:56:30,959
about that in a short while the ops area

1258
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:34,410
working group is a kind of a catch-all

1259
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:36,660
filter for all loose ends which doesn't

1260
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:39,660
mean an important topic so boring topics

1261
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:41,670
but small fragmented topics which don't

1262
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:45,180
have any other home related to

1263
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:47,940
operations and one notable topic which

1264
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:49,950
is being discussed there is the

1265
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:52,289
developments around the protocols

1266
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:55,348
related for the telemetry both

1267
00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:57,569
mechanisms of what do you need to export

1268
00:56:55,349 --> 00:57:00,450
and how and actually encoding some

1269
00:56:57,569 --> 00:57:03,960
things like that operational security

1270
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:05,160
aspects filtering black holding how does

1271
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:09,869
that work what are the recommendations

1272
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:14,910
and practices now cyber operations this

1273
00:57:09,869 --> 00:57:16,950
is kind of as idea has grown cider has

1274
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:19,019
cider ops it's a working group which

1275
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:22,710
deals with the operational deployment

1276
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:24,140
acts aspects of side and the v6

1277
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:26,849
operations

1278
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:30,598
the work group working group dedicated

1279
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:33,259
for topics related to this ipv6

1280
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:39,320
operational and manageability aspects

1281
00:57:33,259 --> 00:57:41,180
now moving to the one part of the

1282
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:48,110
the part of them obscure the

1283
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:50,600
manageability part many of you probably

1284
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:53,420
are running Network Z and many of you

1285
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:57,470
are familiar with the pain points which

1286
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:59,990
are there things like a CMP command line

1287
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:01,330
automation scripts and and topics like

1288
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:05,509
that

1289
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:10,069
the problem space of running the network

1290
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:11,870
is frequently overlooked from both

1291
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:14,810
lenders and the standards perspective in

1292
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:17,420
a sense that we have delivered you this

1293
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:21,500
nice feature it works it interoperates

1294
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:23,510
that's fine the problem solved the

1295
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,900
management aspect of that feature is

1296
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:29,180
frequently overlooked and left aside

1297
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:30,740
basically the parity of feature

1298
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:33,200
management and the feature itself

1299
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:34,220
there's a quite a big gap in that and if

1300
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,560
we are looking from a practical

1301
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:38,000
perspective that's a pain point if I

1302
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,920
have a feature but they cannot manage

1303
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,260
that that feature is more or less

1304
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:46,850
useless for me from a practical point of

1305
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:49,670
view looking into the manageability

1306
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:51,830
aspects we have several large areas here

1307
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:55,670
the configuration itself of a device the

1308
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:57,440
state or how and in what way the device

1309
00:58:55,670 --> 00:59:01,340
operates and the statistics and

1310
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:05,030
operational data related to that if you

1311
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:06,170
look at many of the today's practical

1312
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:08,450
deployment so if you look at the

1313
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:10,610
previous idea of architectures based on

1314
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:13,970
this an MP or on some other telemetry

1315
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:16,550
protocols generally those technologies

1316
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:18,980
cover one of these domains they don't

1317
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:20,840
necessary cover all of them however what

1318
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:22,340
I need if I look from a practical

1319
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,890
perspective if I couldn't figure

1320
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:28,400
something that's what I would like to

1321
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:30,700
know if if the functionality that I

1322
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:34,220
configured is actually operational and

1323
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:35,839
if it is operational at what parameters

1324
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:37,910
it was running a practical example I

1325
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,890
configure bgp session the fact that I

1326
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:42,080
send out a command to the device

1327
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:45,020
establish bgp session with that address

1328
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:48,920
does not mean that the session is there

1329
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:51,400
and if I ask for bgp session with the

1330
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:53,410
particular keepalive interval

1331
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:55,779
does not necessary mean that it will be

1332
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:58,240
that keep a live interval because the

1333
00:59:55,779 --> 01:00:01,269
other side might disagree with what I

1334
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:03,788
have asked for the Box to do therefore

1335
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:06,549
we have three different views of the

1336
01:00:03,789 --> 01:00:12,359
same configuration information and that

1337
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:16,180
needs to be correlated somehow now

1338
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:20,640
looking into the path that IETF is

1339
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:23,319
taking here it's a move away from

1340
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:25,749
configuration protocol based mechanism

1341
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:28,119
into a schema based mechanism what is

1342
01:00:25,749 --> 01:00:30,640
what is less important is actual

1343
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:33,700
protocol which you which you talk to the

1344
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:35,470
device the more important aspect is how

1345
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:39,339
do you structure the configuration

1346
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:41,680
information and looking into the SNMP

1347
01:00:39,339 --> 01:00:44,558
days SNMP sees the world as a table as a

1348
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:47,348
one-dimensional table and if you take

1349
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:49,380
and if you look from a practical

1350
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:53,019
perspective in networking there are many

1351
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:56,400
structures and entities which are well

1352
01:00:53,019 --> 01:00:59,109
represented in other ways like trees

1353
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:03,519
sequences and things like that and it's

1354
01:00:59,109 --> 01:01:08,589
not so easy to represent that in the

1355
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:10,598
SNMP way so what is happening in ITF in

1356
01:01:08,589 --> 01:01:13,269
more practical terms the two large areas

1357
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:16,529
of work one is the definition of the

1358
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:19,569
configuration language it's called Jung

1359
01:01:16,529 --> 01:01:21,519
which defines the schema of the

1360
01:01:19,569 --> 01:01:23,799
information which is needed to configure

1361
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:26,410
the device it's not a configuration line

1362
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:28,180
which is not something that you talk to

1363
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:30,220
the router it's something that describes

1364
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:33,578
the information which eventually will

1365
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:36,129
get sent to the network device for

1366
01:01:33,579 --> 01:01:39,130
changing its state data part

1367
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:41,499
corresponding to this is transport

1368
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:46,079
protocols and coatings and mechanics of

1369
01:01:41,499 --> 01:01:50,848
how that is being sent and interpreted

1370
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:56,289
what this gives for you as an operator

1371
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:58,450
you may have multiple channels into and

1372
01:01:56,289 --> 01:02:01,509
out of the device not necessarily the

1373
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:04,020
same channels channels might be using

1374
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:06,510
the same data representation this game

1375
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:08,670
schema structure for sending out say

1376
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:10,410
intento commands to the device and

1377
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:12,360
getting the results out of it and

1378
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:15,089
getting the notification from sort of

1379
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:17,130
like messages or telemetry data out of

1380
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:20,010
the device and then you have the ability

1381
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:23,970
to correlate all of the free free of

1382
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:28,460
them and eventually if we are looking at

1383
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:32,520
a longer term evolution of manageability

1384
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:37,470
there's a trend of moving away from what

1385
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:39,180
is basically how do you what you do with

1386
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:42,930
the device what commands you send to the

1387
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:45,779
doing to the element to the construct of

1388
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:47,669
what you send the intent saying that I

1389
01:02:45,780 --> 01:02:49,380
want for example functionality with

1390
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:53,120
these parameters now you device your

1391
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:57,210
smart do and even go and implement that

1392
01:02:53,120 --> 01:03:00,029
three things I needed for this to work

1393
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:02,220
practical and efficiently modeling the

1394
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:03,390
the schemas and the definitions of this

1395
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:07,319
configure all for all of this

1396
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:08,970
configuration data to link this this

1397
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,860
model of approach doesn't assume that

1398
01:03:08,970 --> 01:03:13,040
there is an live operator on the event

1399
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:17,160
there's a software component there and

1400
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:21,240
education explaining how this works and

1401
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:24,120
how this practical can be used so in

1402
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:29,069
summary what is happening in the ops II

1403
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:30,839
area is related to how you as operators

1404
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:35,040
community interact with the network and

1405
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:37,830
network devices arguably the biggest

1406
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:41,130
amount of work happening there is

1407
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:43,860
related to configuration modelling

1408
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:46,740
basically describing the functionality

1409
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:50,790
and features in a way of model that can

1410
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:55,529
be used for configuring the devices and

1411
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:57,240
networks now this is not a new topic ITV

1412
01:03:55,530 --> 01:04:01,470
has been working for that for around 15

1413
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:03,450
years and the problematic aspect of that

1414
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:06,569
is acceptance of practical acceptance of

1415
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:09,480
that in the industry it's not as good as

1416
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:10,980
it could have been and that's a question

1417
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,329
of Education that's a question of

1418
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:17,739
explaining how those

1419
01:04:13,329 --> 01:04:20,289
ecology component can be used another

1420
01:04:17,739 --> 01:04:22,390
important aspect that itea frequently

1421
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:24,430
gets caught with is that is to try to

1422
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:28,509
build absolutely perfect and all

1423
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:30,700
covering solution and at once arguably

1424
01:04:28,509 --> 01:04:34,479
that is not needed while it might be a

1425
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:36,368
nice exercise but having something which

1426
01:04:34,479 --> 01:04:40,930
covers the dominant part of the

1427
01:04:36,369 --> 01:04:43,619
functionality and ship that fast is the

1428
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:47,558
model that is needed and that's where

1429
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:50,440
your input as as operators and users of

1430
01:04:47,559 --> 01:04:52,989
this would be very helpful since trying

1431
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:54,729
to define the priorities of the

1432
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:59,219
technology components which I need that

1433
01:04:54,729 --> 01:05:04,269
for you define see the list which covers

1434
01:04:59,219 --> 01:05:07,809
80% or some of majority part of your

1435
01:05:04,269 --> 01:05:11,788
functionality and then define the actual

1436
01:05:07,809 --> 01:05:11,789
components from a website and ship it

1437
01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:20,170
that's that's basically it about the

1438
01:05:17,049 --> 01:05:24,640
operational part I have been talking

1439
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:28,390
with quite a few of you of line here and

1440
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:30,999
also at the previous meetings about all

1441
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:33,069
these young and configuration parts I

1442
01:05:30,999 --> 01:05:35,379
would be very happy to continue this

1443
01:05:33,069 --> 01:05:39,038
discussion basically to get the input

1444
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:41,229
either right now or after all of this

1445
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:43,319
this is something where you certainly

1446
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:46,149
can start participating and providing

1447
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:48,759
the feedback into the ITF and this might

1448
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:51,999
be a rather easy and simple way of

1449
01:05:48,759 --> 01:05:53,949
entering there it's you who are running

1450
01:05:51,999 --> 01:05:56,468
the things and you understand what is

1451
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:58,180
important and what is not so important

1452
01:05:56,469 --> 01:06:01,539
from the operational perspective this

1453
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:03,910
this type of insight does not

1454
01:06:01,539 --> 01:06:08,109
necessarily exist in the idea of

1455
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:10,390
community and that is one of the reasons

1456
01:06:08,109 --> 01:06:12,549
why we have the situation where the

1457
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:14,288
manageability or say proposals

1458
01:06:12,549 --> 01:06:16,449
manageability architectures coming out

1459
01:06:14,289 --> 01:06:20,469
of the ITF take a really long time in

1460
01:06:16,449 --> 01:06:23,609
the industry to get accepted this is

1461
01:06:20,469 --> 01:06:23,609
from my side for now thank you

1462
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:32,759
so later when the slides get posted

1463
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:34,349
you'll see and a routing area overview

1464
01:06:32,759 --> 01:06:36,210
similar to the one that Ignace gave for

1465
01:06:34,349 --> 01:06:38,220
operations and management and that Ron

1466
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:39,989
gave for the internet area but

1467
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:42,180
unfortunately our speaker couldn't be

1468
01:06:39,989 --> 01:06:44,369
with us so if you're interested in the

1469
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:46,200
routing area overview check out the

1470
01:06:44,369 --> 01:06:48,509
slides later and they will have pointers

1471
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:50,220
to many of the relevant working groups

1472
01:06:48,509 --> 01:06:52,440
that people might be interested in one

1473
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:54,479
to check out now I get to talk about

1474
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:59,130
encrypted DNS no I think we need a lot

1475
01:06:54,479 --> 01:07:01,259
of question and answer so hi i'm tail

1476
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:03,569
and when Alissa asked me to come up and

1477
01:07:01,259 --> 01:07:05,970
give you an update on the encrypted DNS

1478
01:07:03,569 --> 01:07:07,619
happenings in the ITF I was like oh good

1479
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:09,180
that's so much easier than talking about

1480
01:07:07,619 --> 01:07:13,799
everything that's happening in the DNS

1481
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:16,739
it's gonna be no problem so basically

1482
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:18,799
when we look into when the first actions

1483
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:21,509
were taken around encrypting DNS

1484
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:23,309
transactions back in May of 2016 we put

1485
01:07:21,509 --> 01:07:25,140
out an RFC for specifying how we could

1486
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:29,069
do DNS query and response between a

1487
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:31,078
client and resolver using TLS and then

1488
01:07:29,069 --> 01:07:35,190
in October of 2018 a couple of years

1489
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:37,799
later we finally put out an RFC on how

1490
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:40,259
we could do DNS queries over HTTPS which

1491
01:07:37,799 --> 01:07:44,038
of course is still over TLS but then

1492
01:07:40,259 --> 01:07:46,499
encrypted in the HTTP protocol earlier

1493
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:48,569
this year this summer we had a Boff on

1494
01:07:46,499 --> 01:07:50,669
talking about okay well you know let's

1495
01:07:48,569 --> 01:07:52,979
have a further look at how this changes

1496
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:54,630
the application landscape with regard to

1497
01:07:52,979 --> 01:07:56,848
DNS but we weren't planning on starting

1498
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:59,460
a working group then and so next month

1499
01:07:56,849 --> 01:08:02,279
we're going to have a birds of a feather

1500
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:03,119
session that's looking towards how can

1501
01:08:02,279 --> 01:08:05,609
we make a working group that

1502
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:08,849
specifically addresses this interaction

1503
01:08:05,609 --> 01:08:11,098
between applications and the DNS so

1504
01:08:08,849 --> 01:08:14,009
pretty straightforward stuff not much to

1505
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:17,009
see here I'm all done I think we get a

1506
01:08:14,009 --> 01:08:22,469
whole hour back so go take some time off

1507
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:24,299
between peering dear no tried I am going

1508
01:08:22,469 --> 01:08:26,399
to try to give you however a nearly

1509
01:08:24,299 --> 01:08:28,528
neutral status report

1510
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:31,488
I'm not evangelizing myself for the

1511
01:08:28,529 --> 01:08:34,139
adoption of any particular technology

1512
01:08:31,488 --> 01:08:35,968
inevitably because I'm talking about the

1513
01:08:34,139 --> 01:08:36,150
reason the ITF is working on at some of

1514
01:08:35,969 --> 01:08:38,390
the

1515
01:08:36,149 --> 01:08:40,889
might sound like advocacy but it isn't I

1516
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:42,509
personally even though I'm the co-chair

1517
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:43,799
of the doe working group I don't agree

1518
01:08:42,509 --> 01:08:47,250
with everything that's happened in the

1519
01:08:43,799 --> 01:08:48,899
space myself I do have I will admit my

1520
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:51,060
bias towards wanting to see encrypted

1521
01:08:48,899 --> 01:08:52,589
DNS but I don't have a passion toward a

1522
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:55,589
particular technology for achieving that

1523
01:08:52,589 --> 01:08:58,109
and notably also my employer has taken

1524
01:08:55,589 --> 01:09:00,600
no position on the whole issue the idea

1525
01:08:58,109 --> 01:09:03,989
of leadership the iesg and the IAB have

1526
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:05,580
taken you know while broadly they're

1527
01:09:03,988 --> 01:09:07,799
moving in one direction there's still a

1528
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:09,658
non-trivial amount of disagreement among

1529
01:09:07,799 --> 01:09:12,420
the leadership about what's happened and

1530
01:09:09,658 --> 01:09:14,580
what should happen next also notably

1531
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:16,080
even though there are a lot of position

1532
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:17,759
papers being put out by different groups

1533
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,528
about either how it's the worst thing

1534
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:21,120
ever to happen to the internet or is

1535
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:21,750
going to be the savior of privacy on the

1536
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,399
Internet

1537
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:26,819
external communities don't even agree

1538
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:29,309
there are for example in the specific

1539
01:09:26,819 --> 01:09:30,480
area of doe there are ISPs not lining up

1540
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:34,020
on both sides of the issue

1541
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:36,599
there are also other external sectors

1542
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:37,859
for example I have talked to some your

1543
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,049
some people in the European financial

1544
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:42,299
sector who are very much in favor of it

1545
01:09:40,049 --> 01:09:43,710
while there of course other enterprises

1546
01:09:42,299 --> 01:09:46,229
that are very much against it

1547
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:48,929
so it's a complicated area that's still

1548
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:50,729
with a lot to be talked about and as I

1549
01:09:48,929 --> 01:09:52,980
said some of this talk might end up

1550
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:57,000
sounding like advocacy but really the

1551
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:59,339
devil was gonna be in the details so how

1552
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,250
did we get here that we're even talking

1553
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:04,710
about dot and doe and encrypted DNS well

1554
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:08,340
we have a ways back to go for the full

1555
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:10,679
context four billion years ago is one

1556
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:12,900
life appeared on earth would go back to

1557
01:10:10,679 --> 01:10:15,330
the Big Bang Theory but we can skip a

1558
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:20,190
little bit then suddenly there were

1559
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:21,929
dinosaurs still are yeah just because

1560
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:23,280
you're the young one in the idea doesn't

1561
01:10:21,929 --> 01:10:27,500
mean that you have to be that way young

1562
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:29,099
man and then about 200,000 years ago

1563
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:30,810
anatomically modern human beings

1564
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,640
appeared basically you know we think

1565
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:34,980
this caveman thing of oh they were all

1566
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,110
so dumb but they were basically us and

1567
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:40,440
so that's when things got really

1568
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:42,870
complicated now I am gonna fast forward

1569
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:44,849
a bit I wanted to take some time to kind

1570
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:46,199
of look at the broad cultural milestones

1571
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:49,450
as Paul did with the Treaty of

1572
01:10:46,199 --> 01:10:51,400
Westphalia talking about you know how

1573
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:53,320
humanity is kind of grappled with the

1574
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:56,410
issue of codifying and controlling good

1575
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:58,120
versus evil and trying to you know

1576
01:10:56,410 --> 01:11:00,880
identify where the error bars should be

1577
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,870
on that but we're gonna put in two

1578
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,060
hundred thousand years of whooshing

1579
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:09,070
noises and actually get into the 2000s

1580
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:11,940
where the IETF published RFC 3514 which

1581
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:16,719
is affectionately known as the evil bit

1582
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:20,500
Steve Bell even actually tried to so it

1583
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:22,990
was an April Fool's RFC Steve actually

1584
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:25,000
really articulated a very interesting

1585
01:11:22,990 --> 01:11:26,889
aspect of trying to manage traffic on

1586
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,660
the Internet is that we don't have any

1587
01:11:26,890 --> 01:11:30,400
really good way of determining what's

1588
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:33,370
good traffic and what's bad traffic what

1589
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:36,580
is what is evil and harming us and what

1590
01:11:33,370 --> 01:11:38,050
is acceptable one thing I noticed when I

1591
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:39,550
is just looking up the reference for it

1592
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:42,160
it actually has a Rada that was

1593
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:45,630
published last year so it's good to see

1594
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:49,059
that the ITF is staying on top of this

1595
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:50,830
so I bet you thought at first that I was

1596
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:52,660
gonna go for Edward Snowden of course it

1597
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:55,330
has to come up this was a you know a

1598
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:58,450
very significant cultural milestone in

1599
01:11:55,330 --> 01:12:00,250
the IETF when Snowden's leaks about the

1600
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:02,410
five eyes program and how multiple

1601
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:05,950
nations were cooperating for global

1602
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:09,250
surveillance of the internet that led

1603
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:10,780
later that year in November into the

1604
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:12,940
IETF tech plenary where was a

1605
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:15,250
significant issue of discussion and kind

1606
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:17,830
of ticked off the eyes IETF response to

1607
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:19,840
figuring out well now that we know that

1608
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:21,430
this theoretical thing is actually a

1609
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,110
practical thing that's happening and

1610
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:24,820
we're responsible for the health and

1611
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:29,799
safety of the Internet what should we do

1612
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:32,799
about it so that led in May 2014 to RFC

1613
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:34,780
7258 many of you may be familiar with it

1614
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:38,290
it made the bold declaration that

1615
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:39,969
pervasive monitoring is an attack what's

1616
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:43,300
interesting about this particular

1617
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:46,390
document is the the IETF tries really

1618
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:47,980
hard to stay in its lane as far as being

1619
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:51,010
a technical standards focused

1620
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:53,580
organization and even this RFC while

1621
01:12:51,010 --> 01:12:57,130
short is written very much focused on

1622
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:59,440
this is the here's the technical problem

1623
01:12:57,130 --> 01:13:03,280
with pervasive monitoring with regard to

1624
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:05,139
the rest of the Internet the ITF

1625
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:08,679
members of the ITF very often claim we

1626
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:10,330
don't do policy but on inevitably the

1627
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,860
technology that we produce kind of

1628
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:15,000
greases the skids for policy in one

1629
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:17,650
direction or another and this particular

1630
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,480
document although it doesn't I think use

1631
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:21,219
the word policy anywhere in it is very

1632
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:24,099
much a policy position paper about

1633
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:26,350
saying here is our intention for

1634
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:28,720
handling pervasive monitoring on the

1635
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:31,180
internet basically we want to secure it

1636
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:33,550
as well as possible and it directly

1637
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:36,700
articulated the concept that was

1638
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:38,500
previously in that April Fool's RFC and

1639
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:40,120
that we can't really tell good versus

1640
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:42,400
evil traffic and so while there might be

1641
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:44,200
benign reasons for doing this kind of

1642
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:46,030
monitoring the system as a whole can

1643
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:51,580
tell and so we have to protect the

1644
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:53,139
system and then as a result of that RFC

1645
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:54,880
the IETF started working in many

1646
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:58,630
different areas about how to lock down

1647
01:13:54,880 --> 01:14:00,490
protocols and and and were evolved them

1648
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:02,680
into secure versions of their previous

1649
01:14:00,490 --> 01:14:04,480
selves and in October of 2014 the

1650
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:06,610
deprived working group was chartered as

1651
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:08,860
previously mentioned the focus of this

1652
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:12,580
was to provide confidentiality for DNS

1653
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:14,559
communication it did already it's had

1654
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:15,970
several different workout which you may

1655
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:19,000
have heard of some of them like you name

1656
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:21,220
minimization and other methods but

1657
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:25,690
notably for the encrypted DNS part of

1658
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:28,180
things it published RFC 78589 t4 this

1659
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:32,259
was for you're basically using DNS over

1660
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:38,080
either a TCP TLS connection or a UDP D

1661
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:39,460
TLS connection what's notable about this

1662
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:42,550
is following the publication of those

1663
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:44,890
documents dot has been implemented

1664
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:47,080
that's deenis over TLS the tcp version

1665
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:49,120
has been implemented in a few different

1666
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:51,550
areas but it sees almost no operational

1667
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,200
use I think jared is still here and he

1668
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:55,060
just recently told me that he can count

1669
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,710
on one hand the number of dot queries he

1670
01:14:55,060 --> 01:15:03,430
seen to his server that implements it

1671
01:14:56,710 --> 01:15:05,050
and DTLS though you know a little bit of

1672
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:07,060
context most of you are familiar with

1673
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:09,040
the fact that dns normally we try to

1674
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:10,720
have very very lightweight in order to

1675
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:12,820
have servers be able to pop you know

1676
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:14,770
handle a really huge volume of queries

1677
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:16,459
in a pretty easy way

1678
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:18,709
throwing kripp

1679
01:15:16,459 --> 01:15:21,110
Chicago fee on top of it is not so

1680
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:23,780
amenable to those goals of light and

1681
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:27,978
fast DTLS was trying to find the sweet

1682
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:30,139
spot well between doing UDP and TLS can

1683
01:15:27,979 --> 01:15:32,239
we somehow make it more efficient but

1684
01:15:30,139 --> 01:15:37,699
nonetheless I'm not aware of it being

1685
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:39,169
used even experimentally following

1686
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:41,780
publication of those documents d-pryde

1687
01:15:39,170 --> 01:15:44,329
was recharged 'red and what it's trying

1688
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:46,550
to do there now because I think I

1689
01:15:44,329 --> 01:15:48,530
mentioned earlier the the initial effort

1690
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:50,150
was to secure the channel of

1691
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:52,759
communication between the client and

1692
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:54,679
it's resolver or from the stuff from the

1693
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:57,739
client stub resolver to the full service

1694
01:15:54,679 --> 01:15:59,150
resolver many of you may recall Paul's

1695
01:15:57,739 --> 01:16:01,268
diagram I'm sorry I didn't include one

1696
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:03,768
about the entire architecture of the DNS

1697
01:16:01,269 --> 01:16:04,999
one of the things though that wasn't

1698
01:16:03,769 --> 01:16:06,530
really worked on because it's a

1699
01:16:04,999 --> 01:16:09,260
different classic problem is how do we

1700
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:10,999
secure the channel between full-service

1701
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:12,530
recursive resolvers and the

1702
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:15,228
authoritative servers that are providing

1703
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:16,550
the real answers and in this context I

1704
01:16:15,229 --> 01:16:19,400
also mentioned that there's often been

1705
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:20,659
confusion about the type of security

1706
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:22,579
that encrypting the channel would

1707
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:24,199
provide and some people think that it

1708
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:25,249
would obviate the in a second degree you

1709
01:16:24,199 --> 01:16:29,348
don't have to worry about the in a sec

1710
01:16:25,249 --> 01:16:31,249
anymore dot and OU provide

1711
01:16:29,349 --> 01:16:32,570
confidentiality on the channel they

1712
01:16:31,249 --> 01:16:34,789
don't provide any sort of data

1713
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:36,438
authentication and so DNS SEC and its

1714
01:16:34,789 --> 01:16:39,009
design goals are still a really

1715
01:16:36,439 --> 01:16:42,559
important part of the overall picture

1716
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:44,900
but in any event this trying to secure

1717
01:16:42,559 --> 01:16:46,909
the authoritative channel is now active

1718
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:49,098
work effort going on within the deep

1719
01:16:46,909 --> 01:16:51,829
rival working group and although it's

1720
01:16:49,099 --> 01:16:53,829
not currently Christian who I don't

1721
01:16:51,829 --> 01:16:56,688
think I've seen here Christian V Toma is

1722
01:16:53,829 --> 01:16:58,909
also proposed how DNS could be done over

1723
01:16:56,689 --> 01:17:00,889
quick which would be likely to see a

1724
01:16:58,909 --> 01:17:03,320
little bit better adoption than DNS over

1725
01:17:00,889 --> 01:17:04,699
T DT LS but so far that's been handled

1726
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:09,920
in the quick working group rather than

1727
01:17:04,699 --> 01:17:12,289
deep breath then September 2017 just

1728
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:15,019
over two years ago we spun up the DOE

1729
01:17:12,289 --> 01:17:17,090
working group it had a very limited

1730
01:17:15,019 --> 01:17:18,920
Charter scope it was intended partly to

1731
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:20,630
be a new model for a pop up working

1732
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,800
group it really the area directors

1733
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:23,300
thought there's going to be awesome we

1734
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,889
have such a narrowly focused charter

1735
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:26,689
that we will publish one document just

1736
01:17:24,889 --> 01:17:29,209
how you would end up tunneling a DNS

1737
01:17:26,689 --> 01:17:30,220
query through the HTTP protocol wrapped

1738
01:17:29,209 --> 01:17:32,170
in TLS

1739
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:33,970
and then we can all just go home shut

1740
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:35,350
down the working group and leave it to

1741
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:38,830
other people to figure out the other

1742
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:43,570
parts of the overall system dough still

1743
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:45,309
exists it was very much focused on just

1744
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:48,820
those technical aspects of tunneling DNS

1745
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:51,790
requests in a GPS and how those get

1746
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:53,980
encapsulated discovery mechanisms were

1747
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:58,540
actually left to be in scope but were

1748
01:17:53,980 --> 01:18:00,849
not pursued at yet because it quickly

1749
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:02,170
got into very difficult technical

1750
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:04,210
questions and they were largely

1751
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:06,220
orthogonal just to how to achieve the

1752
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:10,570
very easy and achievable goal of

1753
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:14,260
tunneling so we published our C 84 84

1754
01:18:10,570 --> 01:18:16,570
and this was the doe protocol itself

1755
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:19,810
they had to do DNS queries over HTTP and

1756
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:24,370
it was met with universal acclaim no

1757
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:26,080
wait that's not right so the group

1758
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:28,000
itself is currently dormant it's a

1759
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,590
waiting IETF consensus about how we

1760
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,610
perceived in the space how we can tack

1761
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:35,680
our next issues so this summer we

1762
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:37,870
started trying to look at that we had

1763
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:39,240
this applications doing DNS both to look

1764
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:41,440
at what the other architects

1765
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:43,750
architectural implementations were of

1766
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:47,169
the way that applications in general not

1767
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:49,960
just web browsers were interfacing with

1768
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:52,390
the DNS what would this mean to have

1769
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:55,120
more applications bypassing the system

1770
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:57,760
resolver and all the different ways that

1771
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:00,630
the system interacts you know what

1772
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:03,520
possible work effort could we do here

1773
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:05,380
because the publication of doe had

1774
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,570
triggered this broader discussion of the

1775
01:19:05,380 --> 01:19:11,380
whole client resolve resolve our

1776
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:13,150
architecture and there were some vendor

1777
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:15,220
experiments and you probably heard of

1778
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:17,589
one because it generated most of the the

1779
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:19,780
flames the Mozilla and CloudFlare

1780
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:22,150
experiment and it provoked strong

1781
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:24,070
reaction and so this is another reason

1782
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:25,599
we're having this Boff because some had

1783
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:26,950
declared that that thought the DNS and

1784
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,930
in the seven stages of grief we

1785
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:32,349
proceeded pretty rapidly into the anger

1786
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:34,630
and bargaining stage the Boff was

1787
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:36,700
seeking to you know figure out well okay

1788
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:38,200
there's clearly a lot of policy issues

1789
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:39,519
here that the ITF can't really do

1790
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,720
anything about but there's also

1791
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:43,520
technical where can we hone in

1792
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:46,370
what technical work might be achievable

1793
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:47,360
for us to move forward on and that

1794
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:50,330
brings us up-to-date with everything

1795
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:54,290
that's happened so far this is in 2019

1796
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:55,640
right oh did I say the Oh June yeah this

1797
01:19:54,290 --> 01:19:59,660
happened just this past summer sorry

1798
01:19:55,640 --> 01:20:02,060
typo on the slide and so I know many of

1799
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:05,269
you wouldn't wondered well why did the

1800
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:07,460
ITF adopt oh you may recall from Monday

1801
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:08,990
the phrase being said be iesg and the

1802
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:13,370
IAB should have been the adults in the

1803
01:20:08,990 --> 01:20:14,599
room and well it's I actually happen to

1804
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:15,680
agree with a lot of things that were

1805
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:19,460
setting that thought but I thought that

1806
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:21,170
was an unnecessary slam the process for

1807
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:22,780
bringing new work to the ITF was

1808
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:28,040
followed there was a very identifiable

1809
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:29,570
technically achievable goal it while the

1810
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:31,040
proponents may have had multiple

1811
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:32,509
motivations in fact I'm sure that they

1812
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,280
had multiple motivations at least some

1813
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:35,900
of those motivations we're consistent

1814
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:38,750
with the things that the ITF was trying

1815
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:40,339
to achieve and the general idea of it

1816
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:44,240
was already in the wild it's not that

1817
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:46,610
DNS over HTTP clear text had been not

1818
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:47,900
already happening there were several

1819
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:51,490
different implementations of it

1820
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:54,980
happening and so it's worth noting as

1821
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:57,019
Alissa pointed out that the ITF is a

1822
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:58,700
voluntary standards organization doesn't

1823
01:20:57,020 --> 01:21:01,070
have a lot of power in this area and

1824
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:02,840
just because the IETF says no that's not

1825
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:05,000
you're not going to do that it doesn't

1826
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:06,260
mean it doesn't happen it doesn't other

1827
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,670
people are still going to work on it

1828
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:11,090
they had been working on it even without

1829
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:13,040
the IETF so one benefit of the ITF

1830
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:14,870
working on it is that the process tends

1831
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:18,350
to bring about better engineering built

1832
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:19,640
right we tend to when we have multiple

1833
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:23,750
people from multiple disciplines

1834
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:25,310
reviewing a protocol then the output

1835
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:27,590
from the working group tends to be

1836
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:29,480
better more implementable than it would

1837
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:30,860
have been otherwise and in fact doe went

1838
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,599
through the same thing the first draft

1839
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:35,299
and doe it's at the final drafted doe

1840
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:36,860
had multiple meaningful technical

1841
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:39,770
differences that improved upon the

1842
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:42,410
protocol and so the thing to remember

1843
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:44,750
here is that DNS over TLS and DNS over

1844
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:45,680
HTTPS there are only providing an

1845
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:47,720
encrypted channel

1846
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:50,090
they don't actually fundamentally change

1847
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:52,160
anything about the DNS there are some

1848
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:53,540
deployment models like the Mozilla

1849
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:55,939
CloudFlare experiment that do

1850
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:57,019
significantly change ideas an architect

1851
01:21:55,939 --> 01:21:59,059
but they're not intrinsic to the

1852
01:21:57,019 --> 01:22:00,800
protocol and I'm not trying to minimize

1853
01:21:59,059 --> 01:22:04,550
the significance of that they could

1854
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:06,289
represent a significant and for some

1855
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:10,249
particular business models and

1856
01:22:06,289 --> 01:22:12,438
operational needs disruptive operational

1857
01:22:10,249 --> 01:22:16,188
change the you know the existing DNS

1858
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:19,400
architecture so that's all relevant but

1859
01:22:16,189 --> 01:22:21,949
it's really important within the context

1860
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:24,650
of the work the IETF does to separate

1861
01:22:21,949 --> 01:22:27,499
our understanding of the way a protocol

1862
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:32,598
works and from the different operational

1863
01:22:27,499 --> 01:22:34,369
ways in which it can be handled so now

1864
01:22:32,599 --> 01:22:37,249
that we're here what's next

1865
01:22:34,369 --> 01:22:39,039
well the ITF itself is going to continue

1866
01:22:37,249 --> 01:22:41,630
to embrace the multi-stakeholder process

1867
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:44,509
for those of you who are unfamiliar with

1868
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:46,219
this principle multistakeholderism

1869
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:48,320
that's involved in many other different

1870
01:22:46,219 --> 01:22:50,929
organizations we try to bring in people

1871
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:52,070
from all communities that are affected

1872
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:54,380
by this

1873
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:58,539
whether it be operators or enterprises

1874
01:22:54,380 --> 01:23:01,639
or developers politics political groups

1875
01:22:58,539 --> 01:23:03,320
everybody is really welcome in the

1876
01:23:01,639 --> 01:23:04,849
process people who are for people who

1877
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:06,889
are against it it's important to have

1878
01:23:04,849 --> 01:23:10,280
all of that input in order to move

1879
01:23:06,889 --> 01:23:13,400
forward to achieve whatever kind of

1880
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:15,590
consensus may be possible to that end

1881
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:17,749
we're having the application behavior

1882
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:20,239
considering DNS both in a few weeks in

1883
01:23:17,749 --> 01:23:22,219
Singapore where we're going to be

1884
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:25,579
planning the next steps for the

1885
01:23:22,219 --> 01:23:27,349
technical standards probably spending up

1886
01:23:25,579 --> 01:23:29,449
a working group on it and so we're gonna

1887
01:23:27,349 --> 01:23:33,229
now tackle issues like resolve or

1888
01:23:29,449 --> 01:23:35,688
discovery and how you could express the

1889
01:23:33,229 --> 01:23:37,429
policies of different resolve resolver

1890
01:23:35,689 --> 01:23:40,760
policy of different resolvers to

1891
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:44,139
characterise them and then so that you

1892
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:47,479
in an environment where you had multiple

1893
01:23:44,139 --> 01:23:48,979
resolver choice yeah we could understand

1894
01:23:47,479 --> 01:23:51,170
and you know how best to guide those

1895
01:23:48,979 --> 01:23:52,849
choices in how their use and provide

1896
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:55,670
other general operational

1897
01:23:52,849 --> 01:23:58,090
recommendations including but not

1898
01:23:55,670 --> 01:24:03,979
limited to you know the the the

1899
01:23:58,090 --> 01:24:07,610
deployment model issue and we're also

1900
01:24:03,979 --> 01:24:08,820
going to have to make clear the ITF

1901
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:10,679
itself through

1902
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:14,309
perhaps an informational RFC or some

1903
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:16,200
other document what the IETF can't

1904
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:18,300
address as a standards organization you

1905
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:22,139
know the actual policy issues that are

1906
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:23,250
completely separate from this and one of

1907
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,990
the things that's really important to

1908
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:26,490
note there is that the deployment choice

1909
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:29,730
is that individual companies make is

1910
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:32,250
really outside the scope of the IDF it

1911
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:34,169
doesn't have control over it we can try

1912
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:37,560
and guide things with our suggestions

1913
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:41,460
but ultimately it's not the ITF making

1914
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:43,290
those final decisions and so really what

1915
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:45,120
I most want to emphasize that if the

1916
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:47,670
outcome of all this process around

1917
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:50,190
encrypted DNS is important to you please

1918
01:24:47,670 --> 01:24:53,610
participate so really important there

1919
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:55,169
are actually now also in addition to the

1920
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:56,429
work that's happening within the ITF

1921
01:24:55,170 --> 01:24:58,410
there are a couple of associated

1922
01:24:56,430 --> 01:25:03,000
organizations that are spun up on on

1923
01:24:58,410 --> 01:25:06,900
advocacy or against and you know your

1924
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:09,030
input and contributions will really be

1925
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:10,320
have them can have a meaningful impact

1926
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:13,679
on how the rest of the process please

1927
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:30,120
home and I believe that was my last

1928
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:32,190
slide yes we're done Bering gear I don't

1929
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:35,910
know if that's true but I mean really no

1930
01:25:32,190 --> 01:25:37,799
questions that's a huge milestone okay

1931
01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:40,080
we'll talk about a DNS and you got no

1932
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:42,270
question so still popular there we go

1933
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:44,670
still country Thank You ina thank you we

1934
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:46,290
couldn't let that happen Chris it's not

1935
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:50,790
a question about DNS it's a question

1936
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:54,269
about IETF so tale said early on in his

1937
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:57,480
talk that you did this thing you went to

1938
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:58,890
the ITF to do this work but in for this

1939
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:01,139
particular presentation you had some

1940
01:25:58,890 --> 01:26:03,120
opinions but no particular slant you

1941
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:05,690
wanted to give to it and you said your

1942
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:09,030
employer didn't either

1943
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:11,160
so is this Pecha is that the IETF right

1944
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:13,590
so do you want to comment on that

1945
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:15,300
Melissa sorry your your question is

1946
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:19,350
about the instruments of employers that

1947
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:21,369
the ATF that you represent yourself not

1948
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:25,610
your employer yes right yes

1949
01:26:21,369 --> 01:26:28,699
like go ahead yeah right so an important

1950
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:30,679
principle of the ITF is that individual

1951
01:26:28,699 --> 01:26:33,259
to represent themselves and generally

1952
01:26:30,679 --> 01:26:35,229
speaking unlike some other organizations

1953
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:37,780
including nanog and write for example

1954
01:26:35,229 --> 01:26:39,800
generally you don't affiliate yourself

1955
01:26:37,780 --> 01:26:42,050
explicitly and when you stand up to make

1956
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:44,900
a comprehend at the microphone the night

1957
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:46,309
well no well at the ITF includes a

1958
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:48,409
number of guidelines for your

1959
01:26:46,309 --> 01:26:50,209
participation and one of the aspects of

1960
01:26:48,409 --> 01:26:52,690
this is that individuals represent

1961
01:26:50,209 --> 01:26:56,300
themselves and not their compass

1962
01:26:52,690 --> 01:27:01,579
on a personal opinion this is of course

1963
01:26:56,300 --> 01:27:02,869
a noble statement of ideal but on the

1964
01:27:01,579 --> 01:27:05,478
other hand people know who you work for

1965
01:27:02,869 --> 01:27:07,369
and will kind of understand you know how

1966
01:27:05,479 --> 01:27:09,139
you might be advocating for the position

1967
01:27:07,369 --> 01:27:11,780
of your employer and so it's not that

1968
01:27:09,139 --> 01:27:14,959
that's never an issue but the default

1969
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:16,940
assumption among people working in the

1970
01:27:14,959 --> 01:27:19,219
ITF is that you were standing

1971
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:21,348
principally for your home views and they

1972
01:27:19,219 --> 01:27:22,880
don't necessarily recommend you know

1973
01:27:21,349 --> 01:27:27,380
represent any cleared view that your

1974
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:29,030
employer may have held it's liberating I

1975
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:34,010
get to go to the microphone and argue

1976
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:36,739
with my boss yeah yeah and I think I

1977
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:40,539
think one of the aspects of that

1978
01:27:36,739 --> 01:27:44,239
speaking as a person is we are keeping

1979
01:27:40,539 --> 01:27:48,409
out of the arguments the weight of the

1980
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:50,749
organization I think I have seen a

1981
01:27:48,409 --> 01:27:55,268
couple of occasions where someone came

1982
01:27:50,749 --> 01:27:57,889
in who was not really familiar and was

1983
01:27:55,269 --> 01:28:02,090
pumping up and saying well okay I'm

1984
01:27:57,889 --> 01:28:05,570
representing this huge influential party

1985
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:07,729
and well okay right doesn't count

1986
01:28:05,570 --> 01:28:10,070
unlike some other paid organizations

1987
01:28:07,729 --> 01:28:13,519
paid standards bodies that you may be

1988
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:16,459
familiar with there's a lot of latitude

1989
01:28:13,519 --> 01:28:18,999
within the ITF I kind of hate to use the

1990
01:28:16,459 --> 01:28:21,349
word meritocracy because it's been

1991
01:28:18,999 --> 01:28:25,190
politicized itself over the past couple

1992
01:28:21,349 --> 01:28:25,789
of years but being able to get things

1993
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:28,159
done

1994
01:28:25,789 --> 01:28:30,409
doesn't stand on whose employers name is

1995
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:32,030
on your badge right like when it comes

1996
01:28:30,409 --> 01:28:34,159
to people getting up to the microphone

1997
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:35,120
there are independent consultants whose

1998
01:28:34,159 --> 01:28:36,830
arguments carry

1999
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:40,460
just as much weight as an engineer from

2000
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:41,990
Apple or Cisco would and I think that's

2001
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:43,760
part of what makes it a better process

2002
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:46,099
it's really welcoming to everybody for

2003
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,600
the most part I think most most

2004
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:49,070
participants are not concerned who you

2005
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,920
work for it's just how good your ideas

2006
01:28:49,070 --> 01:28:53,420
are in fact we have a motto we reject I

2007
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:57,080
figured what it is we reject kings

2008
01:28:53,420 --> 01:29:02,200
experts in Ray and something else we we

2009
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:04,610
honor ruff we reject experts presidents

2010
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:06,679
will reject some important people we

2011
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:09,320
respect rough consensus and running code

2012
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:11,060
right which is a again a noble ideal

2013
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:13,639
that is sometimes warded by the

2014
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:16,370
realities of interpersonal conflict but

2015
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:18,290
but that is the goal is that we're

2016
01:29:16,370 --> 01:29:21,980
looking for the best ideas no matter who

2017
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:24,560
brings them it also means that there can

2018
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:27,080
never really be a nanak representative

2019
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:29,210
to the IETF it means that we as

2020
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:32,059
individual operators need to engage in

2021
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:35,210
the process and contributes arguments

2022
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:38,210
for or against but there can never be an

2023
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:39,620
i as an individual represents the views

2024
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:41,720
of this room not only would that

2025
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:44,750
individual never forget authority from

2026
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:46,790
this group but in IETF context that part

2027
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:54,080
of the footer in the email would just be

2028
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:57,590
ignored David Belson for the

2029
01:29:54,080 --> 01:30:00,500
multi-stakeholder process do you go out

2030
01:29:57,590 --> 01:30:03,110
and solicit input in some cases so like

2031
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:06,680
tail you were talking about with toh

2032
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:09,410
there's you know the various types of

2033
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:11,210
organisations that it may impact so if

2034
01:30:09,410 --> 01:30:12,680
there is no representation say from

2035
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:14,380
governments or certain types of

2036
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:17,120
government do you go out and solicit

2037
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:18,410
input and participation from them or is

2038
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:21,730
it sort of like you didn't show up so

2039
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:21,730
you don't get to complain about it later

2040
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:32,810
so so given again kind of a structure

2041
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:36,590
where I'm so given kind of the structure

2042
01:30:32,810 --> 01:30:38,300
a lot of that relies on either a working

2043
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:41,180
group level or individual initiative

2044
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:44,990
level to bring in the people who are

2045
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:45,400
involved it is often desired but you

2046
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:47,620
know

2047
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:49,660
sometimes it just doesn't get thought

2048
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:52,690
about but many times we realize that

2049
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:54,670
we're talking through an area where for

2050
01:30:52,690 --> 01:30:56,019
example some technical expertise might

2051
01:30:54,670 --> 01:30:58,150
be necessary say in the area of

2052
01:30:56,020 --> 01:31:00,460
internationalization and that expertise

2053
01:30:58,150 --> 01:31:03,460
is not available and when people are

2054
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:05,020
aware that then that's the much more

2055
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:06,880
common way that we see people reaching

2056
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:09,130
out and I'm pulling in the expertise

2057
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:12,760
that's needed but it can be a lot harder

2058
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:15,070
to bring in other advocacy groups or you

2059
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:17,410
know that are - advocacy for their own

2060
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:19,780
particular position it can be a lot

2061
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:21,460
harder to get those people involved we

2062
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:23,290
have done some specific outreach where

2063
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:27,100
we where we knew there was a connection

2064
01:31:23,290 --> 01:31:28,960
like around emergency services and like

2065
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:30,370
large-scale broadband mapping right we

2066
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:32,260
already had some interest from some

2067
01:31:30,370 --> 01:31:33,849
regulators and some countries and we

2068
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:35,860
knew that there were others that were

2069
01:31:33,850 --> 01:31:38,560
generally working in the space and so we

2070
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:39,190
did like proactive outreach to say hey

2071
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:40,690
Ofcom

2072
01:31:39,190 --> 01:31:43,000
you know we think you're interested in

2073
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:45,610
this don't you want to come same thing

2074
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:47,800
we did recently with a new initiative

2075
01:31:45,610 --> 01:31:49,809
which is also going to be a birds of a

2076
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:52,060
feather session at the next IETF meeting

2077
01:31:49,810 --> 01:31:54,220
around web packaging which is this like

2078
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:56,500
signed exchanges bundle web resources

2079
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:59,530
together we know that this is of high

2080
01:31:56,500 --> 01:32:01,030
relevance to content producers and

2081
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:02,889
publishers which is not really a

2082
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:04,599
constituency that tends to show up in

2083
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:06,820
the IETF so we've like had a workshop

2084
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,930
and proactively said hey New York Times

2085
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:09,460
don't you want to come tell us what you

2086
01:32:07,930 --> 01:32:10,660
think about this or somebody from the

2087
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:13,960
New York Times

2088
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:16,599
so in particular context sometimes we do

2089
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:18,550
targeted outreach and I'll also know

2090
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:22,360
really quickly this right here is

2091
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:24,610
outreach all right so if you find it

2092
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:27,190
useful for at least a periodic maybe

2093
01:32:24,610 --> 01:32:28,839
annually updates on what's going on in

2094
01:32:27,190 --> 01:32:30,309
the IETF please reflect that in your

2095
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:32,020
surveys that you'd like to see you to

2096
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:33,040
happen again yeah that's actually a

2097
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:35,710
really good point

2098
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:37,960
we are always debating like how often

2099
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:40,240
does this you know does this yield

2100
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:43,330
anything and we don't have a good data

2101
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:45,730
ourselves so putting feedback into the

2102
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:47,620
survey would be great also if you have

2103
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:49,690
other communities that you're a part of

2104
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:51,519
where you feel like hey they should

2105
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:53,200
really like they would really benefit

2106
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:55,120
from this kind of session or something

2107
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:57,820
I'd love to hear about that because

2108
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:58,079
several of us have gone around and to

2109
01:32:57,820 --> 01:32:59,549
the

2110
01:32:58,079 --> 01:33:02,159
the RIR meetings and some of the other

2111
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:07,940
operators groups but we're always open

2112
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:11,969
to more suggestions tony Tauber again

2113
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:13,799
just in this vein of interacting with

2114
01:33:11,969 --> 01:33:15,980
other groups I mean I think there is

2115
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:18,449
some or has been at different times like

2116
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:20,549
sort of some sort of official liaison

2117
01:33:18,449 --> 01:33:24,480
things with some other standards bodies

2118
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:26,130
like I Triple E or w3c maybe or some of

2119
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:28,500
these I don't know if it's worth talking

2120
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:31,260
about or just sort of say it does happen

2121
01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:34,260
from time to time yeah yeah so for for

2122
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:36,000
SD O's we have people who are designated

2123
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:37,739
as our liaison representatives and they

2124
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,409
have the same thing in Reverse so we

2125
01:33:37,739 --> 01:33:42,449
have a person who's our liaison to 3gpp

2126
01:33:40,409 --> 01:33:46,230
and in 3gpp has a person who's early is

2127
01:33:42,449 --> 01:33:48,269
on to us and we keep in touch with those

2128
01:33:46,230 --> 01:33:50,190
people sometimes we send formal liaison

2129
01:33:48,270 --> 01:33:51,659
statements back and forth when something

2130
01:33:50,190 --> 01:33:53,159
needs to be communicated about a

2131
01:33:51,659 --> 01:33:55,079
document that you're working on or

2132
01:33:53,159 --> 01:33:57,598
what-have-you with an organization that

2133
01:33:55,079 --> 01:33:59,940
we where we have a lot of overlap like I

2134
01:33:57,599 --> 01:34:01,139
Triple E we actually have like a bunch

2135
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:02,940
of their leadership but a bunch of our

2136
01:34:01,139 --> 01:34:06,000
leadership who stay in touch so it just

2137
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:09,150
depends on like how high touch the the

2138
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:11,639
relationship should be depending on the

2139
01:34:09,150 --> 01:34:14,360
amount of work that's joint but we don't

2140
01:34:11,639 --> 01:34:16,849
tend to do it with anything other than

2141
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:22,019
stos so we haven't really done it with

2142
01:34:16,849 --> 01:34:25,050
operator groups for example hi james

2143
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:28,679
shank with team Kamri I thought that I

2144
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:32,480
questioned that I that I had about the

2145
01:34:28,679 --> 01:34:34,800
work of the IETF in general part of the

2146
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:37,530
conversation described things as

2147
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:40,650
innovative or paving away and part of it

2148
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:42,570
was presented as reactive so would you

2149
01:34:40,650 --> 01:34:45,449
characterize and characterize the work

2150
01:34:42,570 --> 01:34:49,290
of the ETA ETA F in general as reactive

2151
01:34:45,449 --> 01:34:52,379
to something that the is already in

2152
01:34:49,290 --> 01:34:55,440
existence in some capacity and needs to

2153
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:57,270
be moved towards a standard or would you

2154
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:59,030
characterize it in general as innovative

2155
01:34:57,270 --> 01:35:04,079
or is it a mix of the two

2156
01:34:59,030 --> 01:35:06,869
it's a mix yeah like SSH and NTP were

2157
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:08,910
formed outside ITF but later brought in

2158
01:35:06,869 --> 01:35:11,070
because ITF is an excellent

2159
01:35:08,910 --> 01:35:13,349
location platform for protocol

2160
01:35:11,070 --> 01:35:15,599
specifications but there's also been

2161
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:20,940
tons of original work in the routing

2162
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:25,350
areas or IP DNS itself started in the

2163
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:28,019
IETF back in the eighties yeah which was

2164
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:32,760
of course in IETF looking very different

2165
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:36,450
from what we have today for the real

2166
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:41,730
research and innovation there is also

2167
01:35:36,450 --> 01:35:42,870
the parallel IRT F so kind of a task of

2168
01:35:41,730 --> 01:35:46,049
the IETF

2169
01:35:42,870 --> 01:35:50,099
is to tackle stuff where we know we can

2170
01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:54,540
get a result while researchers of course

2171
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:58,050
have latitude for okay if something if

2172
01:35:54,540 --> 01:36:00,450
some research does not provide a result

2173
01:35:58,050 --> 01:36:06,330
we actually still have gain knowledge

2174
01:36:00,450 --> 01:36:10,500
and that's value over there but any

2175
01:36:06,330 --> 01:36:13,730
other questions okay well thank you very

2176
01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:13,730
much thank you

2177
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:30,430
you
