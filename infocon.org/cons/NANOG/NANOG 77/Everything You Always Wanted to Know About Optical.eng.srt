1
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:16,270
pardon me if I sound terrible I have a

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,320
bit of a cold so I will try to be

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:22,289
intelligible so purposes this tutorial

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,529
why am I here giving a talk about

5
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,759
optical networking at a theoretically a

6
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,830
routing and switching packet type

7
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:31,660
conference well everything we do on the

8
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,540
Internet largely revolves around fiber

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,100
in some way or form but most of the

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,110
router jockeys that are out there the

11
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,699
people that are building most most IP

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,550
networks really don't get that much

13
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:45,280
exposure to it they might work with it

14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,750
but they're not optical engineers so

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,079
that can lead to a lot of confusion

16
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,760
misconception errors all kinds of issues

17
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,859
out there so the purpose of this

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,530
presentation is really just to kind of

19
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:59,980
touch on all of the major aspects of

20
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:02,710
optical networking so remember I emitted

21
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,959
all of the math there's an entire

22
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:08,350
disciplines out there that focus on this

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,910
specific field and with lots of math as

24
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,360
to how you actually do large-scale

25
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,710
optical planning operation theory the

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,970
purpose of this tutorial is really like

27
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,009
I said just to kind of touch on every

28
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:20,619
topic make sure that people are educated

29
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:24,330
in the the general concepts of the space

30
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:27,130
make you aware of what's out there but

31
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,649
that's the gist of it so the basics of

32
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,750
fiber optic transmission so what is

33
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:34,080
fiber why do we use it so really fiber

34
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,720
is a waveguide for light it's just a

35
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,550
piece of material that carries light

36
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,679
from one end to another so you you put

37
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,209
light in one end comes out the other

38
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:46,660
it's most commonly made of glass or

39
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:48,340
silica could also be plastic why do we

40
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,598
use fiber in the first place well glass

41
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:54,399
is very low cost it's very lightweight

42
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:58,090
it's very flexible it's very high

43
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,459
density so you can build a thousands and

44
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:03,610
thousands of strands of fiber into a few

45
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:05,890
inch cable it's very very light you can

46
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,450
install it on poles you can install it

47
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,970
wherever you want it's very flexible it

48
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,950
doesn't have a lot of the bend radius

49
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,840
issues of kind of copper and things like

50
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,670
that and it can carry a tremendous

51
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,650
amount of information so today the the

52
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:21,010
kind of standard for what can we put

53
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:22,480
over a pair of fiber easy commodity

54
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,219
thing you can buy off the shelf sits at

55
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,380
about seventy six point eight terabits

56
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:28,320
per second

57
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,450
on a single pair it can easily carry

58
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,549
many different signals many different

59
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,410
simultaneous signals without overlapping

60
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,270
with each other so you can grow and

61
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,240
scale and add customers and do things

62
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,980
optically you can carry a signal many

63
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,810
thousands even tens of thousands of

64
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,579
kilometers without regeneration you

65
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,960
might need to amplify it but you you

66
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,760
don't need to regenerate it and I'll

67
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,680
talk more about that later and the

68
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,670
technology continues to radically

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,460
improve so we can do this

70
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:58,859
70 6.8 terabits on fibre that was

71
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,980
deployed 25 years ago that was

72
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,470
originally meant for 100 meg service the

73
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,359
fibre is that infinitely reusable and in

74
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,440
fact we've actually come full circle of

75
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,740
wanting to work with the old fiber today

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,109
so a few things about fiber so light

77
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,390
propagating through vacuum is

78
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,890
theoretically the fastest thing that we

79
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,869
know of that can move in the in the

80
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,059
universe and that comes out to about

81
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,660
three hundred thousand kilometers per

82
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,120
second

83
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,650
so that's written as C so if something

84
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,750
is going exactly the speed of light it

85
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,700
will be 1 C but when light passes

86
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,800
through a material that isn't a perfect

87
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,070
vacuum it actually propagates slower

88
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:42,210
than this so for example when light

89
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:44,269
passes through water it has a refractive

90
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:48,210
index is the way that you describe it of

91
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:50,670
1.33 so light passes through water 1.3 3

92
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:53,760
times slower than it would if it was

93
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:56,130
just propagating through vacuum and when

94
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,810
one light when light tries to pass from

95
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,340
one medium to another with a different

96
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,010
index of refraction you can get a

97
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,480
reflection so if you ever like look

98
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,370
under water and you see a reflection

99
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,690
coming down at you because you're seeing

100
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,240
the reflection of where it's trying to

101
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:13,109
transition to to air that's what you're

102
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,670
seeing so that's why fibre works it's a

103
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,500
principle called total internal

104
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,959
reflection so there's actually two

105
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,930
different types of glass inside this

106
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,150
fiber cable with two different two

107
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,390
different indexes of refraction you have

108
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,429
the core which is where your light stays

109
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:32,640
and it's surrounded by a different kind

110
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,470
of glass called the cladding that that

111
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,270
has a higher index of refraction that's

112
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,560
why the light is always being reflected

113
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,659
back into the core so as long as it

114
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,540
comes in at a certain

115
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,640
Ingle then it will continue to bounce

116
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,950
off the the inside of the fiber come out

117
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,840
the other end if you come in outside of

118
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:51,580
that angle that angle of acceptance then

119
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,929
it wouldn't be wouldn't be do that but

120
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:57,250
that's the way fiber works so here's a

121
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:59,360
gratuitous example using a laser pointer

122
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,650
Wikipedia and a piece of acrylic glass

123
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:07,550
you can you can see the behavior there

124
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:09,500
so fiber is typically used what's called

125
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,240
a duplex system so the most common

126
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,000
deployments you'll see out there we use

127
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,350
two strands of fiber one for a transmit

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,690
one for a receive in each different

129
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,370
direction so that's the the simplest

130
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,810
cheapest optical system that's out there

131
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,940
but the fiber itself is actually

132
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,590
perfectly capable of carrying many

133
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,200
different signals in both directions

134
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,260
simultaneously it just requires more

135
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,909
expensive optical components to do so so

136
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,430
whatever we deploy a system we we make a

137
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,230
decision as to how expensive is this

138
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,380
fiber how constrained is this fiber is

139
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:41,930
it worth optimizing is it worth trying

140
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,390
to get everything down to one strand of

141
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,580
fiber which we could do or is it

142
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:48,080
sometimes just easiest to use two

143
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,849
strands of fiber or can we just throw

144
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,169
more more and more and more pairs and

145
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,420
pairs and pairs of fiber at the problem

146
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,190
and a lot of systems will use ribbon

147
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,780
cables and things like that to throw

148
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,790
more fiber at the problem so it's it's

149
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:03,020
purely a function of economics and the

150
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:05,120
the cost of the fiber itself so the most

151
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,930
basic distinction you can have in fiber

152
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,830
is multimode versus single mode so what

153
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,650
do I mean by that

154
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,659
multimode fiber is fiber that's designed

155
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,849
to work with cheaper light sources so

156
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,610
the fiber itself has a very wide core

157
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:22,010
and it lets you use these cheaper less

158
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,590
precisely focused aimed and calibrated

159
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:27,260
light sources so an older standards that

160
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:30,919
we use LEDs these days it's it's using

161
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:33,110
more more more laser stuff but it the

162
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,820
the premise is you won't be able to get

163
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,010
very long distance over multimode

164
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,130
because the core is so wide it causes

165
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:42,289
what's called modal reflections inside

166
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:44,600
so you'll only be able to get tens to

167
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,580
hundreds of meters of distance but

168
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,229
you'll be able to use these cheaper

169
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,659
optics and interestingly the cable

170
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:51,490
itself is actually more expensive than

171
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,169
then single mode

172
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,509
but the optics themselves are a lot

173
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:58,180
cheaper and that that can be a much

174
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:59,740
better much much bigger benefit so

175
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,250
there's a couple different kinds of

176
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,990
multimode that are out there the older

177
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,650
stuff that you'll see that has an orange

178
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,389
jacket is what's called om 1 or om -

179
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,068
this is otherwise known as fitty grade

180
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:15,849
fiber so this this came out around

181
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:20,650
hundred Meg fitty type connectivity and

182
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:23,169
it's it's designed for that low speed

183
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,388
low speed signal so we then have a sixty

184
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:28,810
two point five micron core or 50 micron

185
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:31,210
core really you see this in the hundred

186
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,800
Meg and gig type signal you can do ten

187
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,049
gig at it but you really start to get

188
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,330
very limited distances and then if you

189
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,889
want to do 40 or 100 you you pretty much

190
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,229
can't do that with this kind of fiber

191
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:45,310
the newer type of fiber that's out there

192
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:47,560
is called om 3 or om 4 and this is laser

193
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,139
optimized so it's actually interesting

194
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,520
the standard the the closest thing

195
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:54,819
that's a standard out there the TI a

196
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,400
standard says aqua fiber for both but a

197
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:59,530
lot of folks have started moving om 4 to

198
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,969
this violet kind of purple fiber to

199
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,549
indicate that it's a slightly different

200
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:07,599
fiber but it's fiber that's specifically

201
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:10,509
optimized for modern laser 10 gig 40 gig

202
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,389
hundred gig type signals so it has much

203
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:15,280
higher bandwidth capability so for

204
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:16,750
example I'm a 10 gig signal you go from

205
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,270
from a 26 meter

206
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:21,340
link to three hundred five hundred and

207
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,080
fifty meters and if you really want to

208
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,119
do four hundred and hundred gigs or

209
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,508
fourteen hundred gig signals you

210
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,610
definitely need this kind of fiber

211
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:33,039
single mode fiber is used for high

212
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,950
bandwidths and long distances so it has

213
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,659
a much smaller core it sits between 8 to

214
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,029
10 microns in size depending on the

215
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:41,979
exact nature of the fiber and there's no

216
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:43,838
inherent distance limitations due to

217
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,029
modal dispersion so that means you can

218
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,160
keep carrying a signal as long as you

219
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:50,980
amplify it every about 80 kilometers

220
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,870
give or take you can carry this on for

221
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,480
tens of thousands of kilometers if you

222
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:58,060
really want to but single mode fiber has

223
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:02,230
a really really really broad array of

224
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,920
types so it also has something like that

225
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,959
looks kind of like multimode where

226
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,939
one and os2 but in single motive that

227
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:09,979
means something different so OS one

228
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,839
means tightly buffered like what you

229
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,510
would see in an indoor patch cable and

230
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,730
OS 2 means it's it's loose fiber that

231
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,730
you would blow through a duct so it

232
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,529
means something very very different

233
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:24,800
you'll also hear something called SM f28

234
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:26,389
that's one of the most classic fibers on

235
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,329
the Internet it's actually a Corning

236
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:30,709
product name so it's kind of the the

237
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:32,060
gold standard it was like there's

238
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:35,119
something original fiber that was

239
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,969
deployed widely going back to the 90s so

240
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,070
now but single-mode fiber comes in a lot

241
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,079
of different types it comes in low water

242
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,029
peak dispersion shifted nonzero

243
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:45,500
dispersion shifted Bend insensitive and

244
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:49,100
a bunch of others and I'll talk more

245
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,779
about that in detail later so here's a

246
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,820
diagram kind of showing you the

247
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:54,829
difference so you can you can see

248
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,399
conceptually the the size of the fiber

249
00:09:54,829 --> 00:10:01,279
and how the the wider multimode fiber

250
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,019
has has more room for the light to

251
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,209
actually reflect around and create great

252
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:09,290
modal dispersion inside there but that's

253
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:10,910
that's the the comparison here's some

254
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:13,219
examples of different fiber connectors

255
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,019
that are out there so this isn't this

256
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,029
isn't the the talk to go through every

257
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:18,440
type of fiber connector but just to give

258
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:20,800
you an idea of some of the different

259
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:25,240
ways that you can terminate fiber

260
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:28,399
everything from you know in the these

261
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:32,149
things that stab in and lock in place to

262
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:36,890
to more modern things like LC higher

263
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:39,769
density things MT RJ MTP cables there's

264
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:42,709
there's a wide wide variety typically

265
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:43,970
the blue tipz means that it's I'll talk

266
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:47,149
more about this later but it means it's

267
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,560
a a polished connector the green tips

268
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:50,870
mean it's an angled polish connector

269
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,420
there's a color code there's a different

270
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,130
scheme to every every different fiber

271
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,599
connector that's out there so that you

272
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,750
know what you're what you're getting and

273
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,339
what you're plugging into so now I'm

274
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,880
going to go through a bunch of basic

275
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:07,670
optical terms and concepts just to talk

276
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,750
about these general concepts so first

277
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,209
thing you have to know when you work

278
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,579
with an optical network is something

279
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:16,099
called optical power and attenuation so

280
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:17,689
optical power is just the brightness the

281
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,790
intensity of the light so

282
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,830
if you think about light traveling

283
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:23,780
through fiber as its as its propagating

284
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:26,210
down the fiber some of that energy is

285
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,770
naturally going to be lost so that's

286
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:32,150
either scattered by microscopic

287
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:33,949
imperfections so you can have you can

288
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,930
have imperfections where it just escapes

289
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,850
through the cladding and and doesn't

290
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,800
continue to be reflected internally or

291
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,900
sometimes you'll actually hit different

292
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,260
hydroxyl molecules and dopants that are

293
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:47,090
in the fiber that that will kind of can

294
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,740
be converted to heat so you'll lose a

295
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:51,500
little bit of power over time as you

296
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,840
propagate through glass so that loss of

297
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,060
attenuation is that loss of intensity is

298
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,160
called attenuation so no matter how good

299
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,930
the fiber is as you propagate across

300
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,079
fiber you're gonna lose some light over

301
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:05,329
time and we measure that in a unit

302
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,040
called decibels so a decibel is one

303
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,650
tenth of a bell it's a logarithmic scale

304
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,189
unit that expresses a relationship

305
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:14,660
between two values so that's something a

306
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,520
lot of people don't understand it's

307
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,310
decibel is what's called a dimensionless

308
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:22,490
unit it doesn't actually describe it's

309
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:25,099
not like saying 100 it's it's not a an

310
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:29,600
actual unit it's describing two things

311
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:32,930
so if you want to oh here's a here's an

312
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,180
example negative ten decibel is

313
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,219
one-tenth the signal negative twenty

314
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,130
decibel is one one hundredth of signal

315
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,450
so you see the logarithmic relationship

316
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,430
another really easy one is it's not

317
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:46,400
quite as precise but it's really close

318
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:48,680
is whenever something goes up three D up

319
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,410
three dB you've doubled the signal when

320
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,020
it goes minus 3 dB you've cut the signal

321
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:56,959
in half but it remember it doesn't tell

322
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:59,780
you double of what it's it's just that

323
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,820
value so if you want to express an

324
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:04,490
absolute value if you want to express

325
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:07,040
this level of brightness you need a

326
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,750
reference and in optical networking we

327
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,120
use something called a DBM that's a

328
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:15,170
decibel relative to one milliwatt of

329
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,380
power so 0 DBM is an absolute measure of

330
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:21,319
brightness that is 1 milliwatt of power

331
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,730
so like I said plus 3 you've now doubled

332
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,320
that you're up to 2 milliwatts if you

333
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,320
were minus 3 you've cut that in half

334
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,330
you're at your point 5 millivolts but

335
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,340
confusing these two is probably the

336
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,660
single biggest mistake that you'll see

337
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,460
in the field you'll see people go out

338
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,680
with light meters and and be in the

339
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,080
wrong mode and get the wrong value so be

340
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,530
be very very aware of which value you're

341
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,510
working with when you look at these so

342
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,790
why do we measure light in decibels well

343
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,460
light just like sound follows what's

344
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:51,589
called the inverse square law so that

345
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,240
means the distance the the signal is

346
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,190
inversely proportional to the distance

347
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,190
squared so here's an easy way to think

348
00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:00,470
of that you you send a signal the signal

349
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:03,440
travels distance X and it loses half of

350
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:06,530
its intensity so now what happens when

351
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,750
the signal travels to X well it loses

352
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:11,209
half of its intensity again so only 25%

353
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:13,970
remains what happens when it travels 3x

354
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:17,660
so it loses half again so it only 12.5%

355
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:20,150
remains for X loses half again so 6.25%

356
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:22,790
remains if you use a logarithmic scale

357
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:25,610
and makes the calculations a lot simpler

358
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:28,189
so imagine convert that into a 3 DB

359
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:31,040
change now you could say that there is 3

360
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:36,110
DB of loss per distance X and as you

361
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:38,420
move to X 3 X 4 X you see 3 DB 6 DB 9 DB

362
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,950
it makes the elementary school math and

363
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,750
it makes it easier on the humans to work

364
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:45,470
with that's the whole point of using a

365
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:47,540
logarithmic scale here's a handy little

366
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,220
conversion table that you can look at if

367
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:53,780
you ever want to figure this out you can

368
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:55,700
also just Google DB M DB M 2 MW you can

369
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,610
you can find all these these wonderful

370
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,440
handy tables on the internet so another

371
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,090
major concepts when you work with

372
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,190
Optical is something called dispersion

373
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,050
so dispersion just means to spread out

374
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:08,900
so you have this this signal that in

375
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,400
some way is spread out and at a certain

376
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,230
point it becomes indistinguishable

377
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,880
you're not actually able to decode what

378
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:17,360
you were you were originally trying to

379
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,250
to say the two types of dispersion that

380
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,090
we care about our chromatic dispersion

381
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:24,920
and polarization mode dispersion so

382
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,300
chromatic dispersion is what happens

383
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,610
when different frequencies of light

384
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,069
propagate at different speeds through a

385
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:33,410
non vacuum so this is actually the

386
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,960
reason prisms work this is the reason

387
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,660
rainbows work you're seeing the light

388
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,980
spread out because they're propagating

389
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,870
at different speeds depending on the

390
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,250
frequency and eventually you end up

391
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:48,090
after some amount of distance where

392
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,610
what was to clear pulses of ones and

393
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,630
zeros now becomes indistinguishable

394
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,760
because it's it's spread out so

395
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,590
chromatic dispersion is actually one of

396
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,439
the biggest limiting factors in

397
00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:01,320
everything that we do optically the

398
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,510
faster your symbol rates become the the

399
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,460
more this is impactful the wider your

400
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:08,670
laser line with the more the more you

401
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,840
care and the worst set of so the wider

402
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,030
your line with the worst chromatic

403
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,990
dispersion affects you and it affects

404
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:17,880
you at the square of the baud rate so

405
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:20,220
typically chromatic dispersion was the

406
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,840
inherent limitation for all of our

407
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,900
optical technology coming all the way up

408
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:27,270
to 10 gig and it's still a major

409
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,689
limitation as you look at things like 25

410
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:34,140
gig and and 100 gig of consumed of

411
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:36,810
multiple multiple 25 gig signals it's

412
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,460
it's still a major major limitation and

413
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,020
we express chromatic dispersion in

414
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,210
what's called picoseconds per nanometer

415
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:46,140
so that's the the unit that you measure

416
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:47,730
this in the other kind of dispersion is

417
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,040
what's called polarization mode

418
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:53,100
dispersion so this is what happens when

419
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:56,040
one polarization of light arrives later

420
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,350
than the other so think about a fiber

421
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,480
being a cylinder

422
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,820
sometimes the fiber isn't perfectly

423
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,610
shaped sometimes there's different kinds

424
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:08,220
of stresses as the fiber is bent as the

425
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:10,229
fiber underwent different stresses as it

426
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,690
was manufactured it wouldn't be exactly

427
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,450
perfect and so you end up with a

428
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:17,430
horizontal polarization of light

429
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:20,550
arriving slightly faster or slightly

430
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:22,260
slower than you know a vertical

431
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,629
polarization and that's what's called

432
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:26,400
DGD differential group delay which we

433
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,840
just measure in Pico seconds so these

434
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,350
are the two things that you really care

435
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,270
about when you're working with fiber the

436
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,800
fiber optic transmission bands the the

437
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,889
different frequencies of light that we

438
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:41,129
use there's a couple different ones so

439
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:43,230
850 is one of the most common ones that

440
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,750
you see used in short reach applications

441
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,730
so this is your most of your multimode

442
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,310
fiber runs here these are all your short

443
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,860
reach things it's it's high attenuation

444
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:56,730
it's it lets you use really cheap simple

445
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,719
basic lasers or LEDs but it doesn't go

446
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,810
very far

447
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,640
13:10 is what's called Obon which stands

448
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:05,870
for the original band not very

449
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:10,050
innovative naming and so this covers

450
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:12,719
1262 1360 so this is a hundred nanometer

451
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:14,580
chunk of spectrum with 1310 kind of

452
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,470
sitting there at the center and

453
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,240
historical footnote you'll see some

454
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,910
people say 1300 you'll see some people

455
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,310
say 1310 they're all talking about the

456
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,570
same thing but it just depends what what

457
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:27,870
different people have used to represent

458
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,939
the center of this this is this is

459
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,340
really used for your intermediate reach

460
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:35,190
this is your two to ten kilometre type

461
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,679
reach applications you'll see it used

462
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,770
for longer you can some people are doing

463
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:43,790
30 40 kilometers with 1310 but it's it's

464
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:46,920
really it's the point of lowest

465
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:48,389
dispersion for classic single mode but

466
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,040
it's also a point of higher attenuation

467
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:53,400
so that's why you see it used for that

468
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:56,399
intermediate reach the 1550 band which

469
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,790
is called the C band for conventional is

470
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,710
defined around what you can amplify with

471
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,690
an Ed phone I'll talk more about this in

472
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:08,460
a minute but it's a big chunk of

473
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:11,550
spectrum that is used for long-haul DWDM

474
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,890
everything that we do that's fancy it's

475
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,750
the the point of lowest attenuation so

476
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,980
it's where you can send the signal the

477
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,740
farthest that's where you'll actually be

478
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,900
able to get a good 80 kilometer reach or

479
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,820
more on an individual link before you

480
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,410
have to amplify this is where you see

481
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,560
pretty much everything centered around

482
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:30,780
long reach and DWDM the only time you

483
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,139
see anything different is if you see

484
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,340
something using L band so L band is

485
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:38,660
think of it like an extension to sieve

486
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:42,209
and it has very very similar properties

487
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:44,040
it's just an expansion of it so if you

488
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:46,110
ever fill up your C band and you really

489
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:50,129
really really need to put more capacity

490
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:51,990
on that they have different amplifiers

491
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:53,910
that will work that will affect things

492
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,010
in the elbe and they have different

493
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,870
things that are although the components

494
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,910
have to be tuned slightly to be

495
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:03,600
compatible with it but it behaves very

496
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:07,140
much like a an overlap of C band with

497
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,740
slightly worse performance here's what

498
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,340
that looks like

499
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:14,130
on a chart so you see here the the

500
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,080
- line at the top shows the way the

501
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:19,710
fiber worked kind of going back to the

502
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,379
early 80s there were certain peaks as

503
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,870
it's called water peak so basically in

504
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,180
the manufacturing process there are

505
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:29,280
these hydroxyl molecules that that get

506
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,680
in the glass that are very difficult to

507
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,840
take out and so the early fiber had

508
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,240
certain frequencies of light that had

509
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,090
very very high attenuation you just

510
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,560
weren't able to use those chunks and we

511
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:46,470
used the the windows around those those

512
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,810
water Peaks to work with what we put on

513
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,430
the fiber and as you see the the fibers

514
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,560
gotten better and better and better and

515
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:56,130
these days modern fiber has has a very

516
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,590
low peak you still might not want to use

517
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:01,500
the water peak because it's not the

518
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,510
optimal point of the fiber but we've

519
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,580
gotten much much much better in modern

520
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:09,470
fiber and we can work with this if we

521
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:13,199
need to if wherever spectrum constrained

522
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:15,120
a big concept in working with optical is

523
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,060
something called the O SNR the optical

524
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,639
signal to noise ratio so if you do any

525
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,620
kind of a long haul system an amplified

526
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,200
system anything that that's more than a

527
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,000
point-to-point system the O SNR becomes

528
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,510
the biggest thing that you care about

529
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,670
and it's the the ratio between the the

530
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,620
signal the the nice clean signal that we

531
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:36,420
have in the center here of the the laser

532
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,159
we're trying to transmit and whatever

533
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,870
our noise floor is whatever that

534
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,510
background is that that we can't

535
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:44,699
distinguish from our original signal so

536
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:47,629
this becomes a thing that you talk about

537
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:50,730
later the performance of optical systems

538
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:54,570
so now I'm going to talk about wave

539
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:56,790
division multiplexing so wave division

540
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:58,710
multiplexing we know that light comes in

541
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,659
many different colors so what we

542
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:03,780
perceive as white light is really just a

543
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,760
mix of all of the colors of light so

544
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,190
what that means is that you can have

545
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,490
different colors of light combined on

546
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:13,410
the same fiber and the goal is the the

547
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:14,970
light different different channels

548
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,170
different frequencies of light will go

549
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,380
right past each other without

550
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:22,740
interfering so you can have large amount

551
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,990
of capacity built into the system by by

552
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,910
adding more and more and more channels

553
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,260
as individual wavelengths and then you

554
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,850
filter it out on the other side pick

555
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:33,870
just the frequency that you want that's

556
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:35,070
the the general concept of WDM so

557
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,169
there's a couple different ways that you

558
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:39,149
can do that the most basic way is

559
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:41,280
something called CWDM which stands for

560
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:43,980
coarse wave division multiplexing and

561
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,040
that's you loosely use to mean anything

562
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,970
that's not DWDM it means a lot of

563
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,200
different things to a lot of different

564
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:54,300
people so one popular name is there's 8

565
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,780
channels with 20 nanometer spacing so

566
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:59,460
like a 14 70 or 1490 a 15 10 that's a

567
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,899
that's a really common thing that's been

568
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,570
been wandering on the industry for a

569
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,280
while if you use low water peak fiber it

570
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:08,040
actually adds another 10 channel so you

571
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,470
can have 18 total CWDM channels that you

572
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,720
can work with it could also be used to

573
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:13,920
refer to something like a 13 10 15 15

574
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,620
bucks where you just take these two

575
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,850
really simple common frequencies put

576
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:22,860
them together and call that CWDM or as

577
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:27,209
friends of mine have called it GWD and

578
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:29,040
geto WDM dense weave division

579
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,620
multiplexing is a lot more

580
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,770
standards-based so there's an ITU grid

581
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:38,189
that defines the exact channels the

582
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:40,350
exact frequencies so within c-band

583
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,810
there's a couple different channel sizes

584
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:45,870
that are common so you have 200

585
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:47,310
gigahertz which would give you a 1.6

586
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:51,540
nanometer spacing so there's going to be

587
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:54,629
22 24 channels 100 gigahertz which is

588
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:56,460
still pretty common you know 40 to 48

589
00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:00,450
channels all the way down to 50 and 25

590
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:03,180
so the reason for this this is this has

591
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:06,270
evolved throughout the year so 200 gig

592
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:07,800
is pretty uncommon these days so you

593
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,690
have to you have to go out to like the

594
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,180
obscurest parts of the internet to still

595
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:15,990
find this this is kind of 2000 era very

596
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:20,280
old very antiquated technology 100

597
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:23,040
gigahertz is still very common for DWDM

598
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:27,090
in the Metro so lots and lots of systems

599
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:30,120
use 100 Gig tunable gives you so when I

600
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:32,669
say 40 to 48 channels 48 is what

601
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,830
actually fits in the sieve and and what

602
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:38,669
ends up happening is either

603
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:40,230
you can't fit 48 connectors into a 1u

604
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:42,480
so people just shave it down to 40

605
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:44,850
because that's all that fits or they'll

606
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,739
leave off a couple of bands because

607
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,418
they'll they'll also sell products will

608
00:24:46,739 --> 00:24:50,639
they'll say here's an eight and ate and

609
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:52,169
ate and ate and they'll leave a channel

610
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:54,209
empty in the middle so that you can

611
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:55,739
stack those multiple eights so that's

612
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,809
why if you really wanted to push it you

613
00:24:55,739 --> 00:24:59,220
could go all the way to 48 but a lot of

614
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:03,149
products that you see out there are

615
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:05,489
built around something like 40 the 50

616
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:08,100
gigahertz systems are still the most

617
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:11,100
common widely deployed commercial long

618
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,408
haul so if you you any kind of a long

619
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:15,269
haul system any kind of a an external

620
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:18,419
transponder or any kind of you go to an

621
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:20,039
infant area ro Siena those are the

622
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:23,340
systems that are that are still the

623
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:27,779
widest deployed and still still going in

624
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:29,488
today 25 actually was used briefly as we

625
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:31,080
were as we were moving our way through

626
00:25:29,489 --> 00:25:33,419
technology we were getting denser and

627
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:38,879
denser and denser we got all the way up

628
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:40,169
to a 25 gigahertz for for 160 or 192 10

629
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:42,809
gig channels and then we actually

630
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:44,879
started backing away from that so 25 is

631
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:48,178
kind of considered old defunct

632
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:50,730
technology now too because we we ended

633
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:53,279
up finding different ways to pack our

634
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,629
our channels but the modern systems can

635
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,429
actually be very flexible there's a

636
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:59,100
technology called flex grid that'll talk

637
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:01,049
more about where you can actually create

638
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:04,259
channel sizes that are different widths

639
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:06,929
a lot of new technology actually depends

640
00:26:04,259 --> 00:26:08,369
on on different different widths out

641
00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:10,440
there so you'll start to see a lot of

642
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:12,238
things going forward you're not gonna

643
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,889
see these old it's just a hundred

644
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:17,850
gigahertz it's just 50 gigahertz you're

645
00:26:13,889 --> 00:26:20,070
gonna see more more advanced things so

646
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:22,738
here's a little diagram showing a

647
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,960
channel size comparison here just to put

648
00:26:22,739 --> 00:26:27,899
it in perspective what a CWDM channel

649
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:31,440
looks like with you know 4 or 8 or 16 of

650
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:34,439
these vs. 8 each anoles

651
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,029
in a in a 50 gigahertz system and c-band

652
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,850
and what another 80 would look like in

653
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:41,059
l-band so you see the the DWDM channels

654
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:43,799
are much much much tighter and smaller

655
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:44,789
so what are the advantages to this why

656
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,499
why do we have these two different

657
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:49,499
systems well CWDM

658
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:51,869
it's not that the laser is actually any

659
00:26:49,499 --> 00:26:52,630
narrower it's not that the signal itself

660
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:55,810
is why

661
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:58,330
the width of the signal is actually

662
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,399
proportional to the baud rate so as we

663
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:03,280
move like from one gig to 10 gig to 40

664
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,470
gig that increases the width what's

665
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,660
called the line width of the laser but

666
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:09,790
the whether it's a DWDM or not actually

667
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,280
doesn't make this signal any wider the

668
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:14,139
reason that it's a wide Channel is

669
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,149
because we get to use cheaper cooling

670
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,680
systems so as the laser heats up it'll

671
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:19,450
it'll move of this way as it cools down

672
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,070
it'll move this way and because we have

673
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:23,020
this very wide channel it really doesn't

674
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,980
matter where it falls it still fits in

675
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,850
there

676
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:31,240
the DWDM systems are just more expensive

677
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:33,730
from from a cooling perspective you

678
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:35,320
could have far more channels on a DWM

679
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:38,590
system so like I said you can go up to

680
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,840
96 channels in 50 gigahertz in 32

681
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:43,600
nanometers of spectrum versus 8 channels

682
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:46,000
at 160 so you can obviously have a lot

683
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,010
more capacity but the big advantage to

684
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,300
DWDM is that you can stay completely

685
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,460
inside the c-band

686
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:54,040
or they'll ban if you wanted and that's

687
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,210
the area where you can do amplification

688
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,030
so I'm going to talk a lot more about

689
00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:00,460
that later but that's the the area where

690
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:03,010
you can carry a fiber signal for more

691
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:05,700
than one hop make it brighter through

692
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:09,910
amplification and do long-haul systems

693
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:12,520
so other other ways that we use WDM like

694
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:15,220
I said there's other forms so the 1310

695
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,930
1550 that's a really simple basic easy

696
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:21,280
way to hey I just want to double the

697
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:24,730
capacity of a system you'll see a lot of

698
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,440
multi Lane gray optics so the way this

699
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:29,830
works is as we move through new

700
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:34,330
technology as we move from 10 to 240 to

701
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:36,070
a hundred to two now 400 whenever we

702
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:40,570
create a new technology it's actually

703
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:43,210
very hard to do a single serial Channel

704
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,340
so when 10-gig first came out it was it

705
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:48,340
was incredibly difficult to do a native

706
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:50,770
10 gig signal so we actually created a

707
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:53,500
an early version of 10-gig called LX 4

708
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:56,470
and all it did was run for different 2.5

709
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,510
gig waves inside and it was much cheaper

710
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,910
and easier and it went further and it

711
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:03,520
was just much much easier to work with

712
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:05,410
to use 4 parallel versions of the lower

713
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,269
speed signal than it was one high-speed

714
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,619
version and then

715
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:09,029
for time we got better and better and

716
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:10,439
better and eventually it flipped so

717
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:12,479
eventually it goes the opposite where

718
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,489
the overhead of putting in a gearbox to

719
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:16,950
do four lanes becomes more expensive

720
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:19,289
more difficult than than just working

721
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:21,299
with one native 110 gig signal and so

722
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:23,609
these days you you rarely see anything

723
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:26,399
like that but you know if you go back 10

724
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:28,859
years ago lr4 or Alex 4 was a popular

725
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:32,758
standard so very similar thing at 40 gig

726
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:35,699
40 gig II actually doesn't a 40 gig as a

727
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:37,200
native signal doesn't really exist so if

728
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,820
you ever go up to a router and see a 40

729
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,339
gig port you are never ever ever ever

730
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,559
ever looking at a native 40 gig signal

731
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:46,589
you're looking at four parallel 10 gig

732
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:50,190
signals and so that will just run at a

733
00:29:46,589 --> 00:29:53,820
CWDM type frequency similar at 100 gig

734
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:56,700
the most pervasive hundred gig standard

735
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,109
right now actually there ironically LFR

736
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,639
is not the most pervasive it's actually

737
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:02,699
only like 8 percent of the market but

738
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:05,008
from a router perspective the the ones

739
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,499
that we see as network operators

740
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:09,269
building the internet lr4 is the most

741
00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:13,409
pervasive standard is actually four

742
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:15,869
different lanes of 25 gig because that's

743
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:18,479
much much cheaper and easier than ever

744
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:20,009
are one which is the the single lambda

745
00:30:18,479 --> 00:30:22,349
version of it and will probably continue

746
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:24,329
to be so for another 18 months 24 months

747
00:30:22,349 --> 00:30:25,829
something along those lines but you know

748
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:27,059
three years from now eventually we're

749
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:29,700
gonna we're gonna cross a point where

750
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:32,700
all of our lr4 goes away and we move to

751
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:37,109
a single single hundred gig lambda

752
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:39,359
you also see single strand optics so BX

753
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:40,649
bi-directional so you'll you'll have an

754
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,049
optic that just kind of has a little

755
00:30:40,649 --> 00:30:45,149
tiny integrated MUX in it so you can you

756
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:46,859
can if you have a fiber pair you could

757
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:48,149
use one strand for one link and one

758
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:49,949
strand for another link and it's just a

759
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:51,689
without requiring any specialized

760
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,549
knowledge whatsoever it's just a cheap

761
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:57,149
easy way to double capacity and you'll

762
00:30:53,549 --> 00:31:00,658
see you'll see you just use this WDM so

763
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:02,549
some of the WDM channel terminology when

764
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:05,399
you when you hear someone say a hundred

765
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:07,559
gigahertz MUX what they're talking about

766
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:09,988
there is the channel spacing so it's a

767
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:12,059
hundred gigahertz is the the space from

768
00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:14,219
the center of one channel to the center

769
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:16,619
of another channel but that's not that's

770
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:18,479
describing one very small piece of the

771
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:19,360
MUX right there there's a lot of other

772
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:21,580
things that you

773
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,379
about so you care about the channel

774
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,970
passband that's the amount of signal

775
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:28,510
that's actually able to be carried

776
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:30,040
across this channel and if you if you

777
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,720
have a very narrow channel past man than

778
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,870
you you clip the light on the edges so

779
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:40,210
you you would get only a small channel

780
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:42,100
in the center you have ripple which is

781
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,380
the the shape of the curve sometimes

782
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,270
you'll have different parts of the the

783
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,460
curve that have higher or lower

784
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:50,650
attenuation than than others

785
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:53,200
you have channel isolations so you you

786
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:55,390
care about how effective am I at cutting

787
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,670
off the frequency from one side to the

788
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:59,380
other and so you have adjacent channel

789
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:00,940
isolation total channel isolation like

790
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,040
how affect them I'm cutting off the

791
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,360
background noise from other channels

792
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,610
there's there's all these different

793
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:10,240
things that come into play when you look

794
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:12,429
at D to be DM channels so now I'm going

795
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,690
to talk a little bit about WDM

796
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:17,860
networking components in general so I

797
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:19,030
just talked about it a little bit but a

798
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,790
MUX an edema

799
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:23,830
this is probably the the single simplest

800
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:26,970
easiest most basic thing that you'll see

801
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:29,800
in a WDM system it is a passive

802
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:33,250
unpowered generally uncooled

803
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:35,560
device that combines or splits multiple

804
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:38,290
colors of light into a single common

805
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,570
fiber or fiber pair so it's short for a

806
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:42,850
multiplexer sometimes you'll hear it

807
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:44,889
called a filter or prism so a filter

808
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:46,510
does a better job of describing how it

809
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:49,540
actually works you're actually filtering

810
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,379
specific frequencies of light but a lot

811
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,970
of people kind of conceptually

812
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,530
understand that a prism is a thing that

813
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,960
splits light and so you'll hear it

814
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:59,110
called a prism and a complete system

815
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,880
requires a MUX in a d-max so generally

816
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:04,840
speaking you'll have so if you you ever

817
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,940
crack open like a 1u box it'll have

818
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,280
something like this inside it'll have

819
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,720
the actual MUX component and it'll

820
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,310
probably be two of them for a MUX and a

821
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,940
D mock so they'll all be put into into

822
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:17,830
one little unit and this takes you know

823
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:21,120
this one's probably like a 16 channel

824
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:23,830
system and combines it into into one

825
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,239
another major component is what's called

826
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:29,500
an OID of an optical add-drop

827
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:31,270
multiplexer so if you think of a MUX as

828
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,650
the endpoint you think of it as the the

829
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:34,210
starting point of a piece

830
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,800
a fiber or you take a lot of signals

831
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:38,890
combined them into one strand and send

832
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:41,500
it down and Oh a DM becomes a good

833
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:44,830
midpoint so it's a way for you to

834
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:47,170
selectively add certain channels without

835
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:49,179
having to drop all of them so you could

836
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:51,970
you could do this if you have like three

837
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:54,040
segments you could have a full MUX DMS a

838
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:55,540
full MUX d MUX a full MUX D MUX but

839
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,580
there's a lot of insertion loss there's

840
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,470
a lot of a penalty overhead cabling

841
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:02,409
overhead associated with that break out

842
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:03,790
of all 40 or 80 of those channels if all

843
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:06,250
you want to do is pass some of them

844
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:07,960
through so no idiom is just wired so

845
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,668
that some of the channels are dropped

846
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,800
and can be broken out and some are

847
00:34:09,668 --> 00:34:13,629
passed through and if you you build a

848
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,640
well-constructed au ATM ring you can

849
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:16,929
reuse different pieces of the frequency

850
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,759
at different parts of the Rings so you

851
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:21,159
can have a group of channels that are

852
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,540
reused every single time you can have

853
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,690
other channels that pass all the way

854
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:28,719
through and no idiom is also a

855
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:31,450
completely unpowered passive device it's

856
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:35,879
it's a very similar in concept to how a

857
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:38,080
MUX works there's a bunch of different

858
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,760
technologies that are used in these

859
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,969
passive components so they're the three

860
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,250
main types one is called an FPGA fiber

861
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:48,009
Bragg grating so what's happening here

862
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,540
is you're basically itching the core of

863
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:51,220
the fiber you're creating these little

864
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:53,350
tiny notches and they do this with this

865
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:55,000
very powerful laser that that's creates

866
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:59,020
these these little notches inside the

867
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,140
fiber and the exact distance the notches

868
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:06,250
are creates reflections of certain

869
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:08,859
frequencies so uuh a tiny little piece

870
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:11,800
of fiber and it creates say okay we will

871
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:14,770
reflect this little tin 10 nanometer

872
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:17,860
chunk back so here you you see in this

873
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:19,990
little diagram there's a chunk here that

874
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,030
as the light comes in this one frequency

875
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,770
is reflected and everything else is

876
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:25,510
transmitted through and then you stack

877
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:27,970
multiples of those on top of each other

878
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:30,130
to create your ear system so these are

879
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:33,910
very common in low channel count systems

880
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:37,060
kind of your 8 or less if you if you

881
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:38,980
just have a basic 1310 1550 or any kind

882
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:42,700
of a thing like that these tend to be

883
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:45,880
FBG based the medium channel systems are

884
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:49,419
what's called thin fin filter so it's a

885
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:53,220
it's a lot of the same technology used

886
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:56,950
in photography you're creating these

887
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:58,569
optical filters with different colors of

888
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:01,240
light and so you pass through and you

889
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,950
filter out different ones the more

890
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,720
interesting one the one that you see for

891
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:08,200
the larger systems is what's called an

892
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,299
AWG and a raid waveguide grating so if

893
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,740
you've got a 40-channel system that's

894
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,270
definitely what this is if you've got an

895
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:16,899
80 channel system typically it's just

896
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:20,830
two of these glued together what this is

897
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:23,530
is a two prisms so imagine you have an

898
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:25,840
input and output and you have a prism on

899
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:28,360
one side that spreads the light out and

900
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,010
it spreads it out into a big array of

901
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,930
fiber so if you got a 40 channel system

902
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,270
there's 40 fibers and they're all

903
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,859
unknown length so this this one strand

904
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:38,530
is slightly longer than this strand is

905
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:41,320
slightly longer than this strand so it

906
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:44,200
comes together into another prism and

907
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:47,500
because of the different lengths of

908
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,540
cable you're creating a giant

909
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,320
interferometer you create a lot of

910
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,290
constructive and destructive

911
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:57,400
interference and so it ends up breaking

912
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:59,410
out these these signals into into your

913
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,940
40 or 80 different different channels

914
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:03,190
through constructive and destructive

915
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,110
interference but that's that's how it

916
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:07,120
works the original versions required

917
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:08,770
active cooling the ones you see these

918
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,779
days are what's called an a AWG a

919
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:13,540
thermal so they're their basic

920
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:15,070
standalone they require nothing and that

921
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:18,670
that's what you'll see in most of those

922
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:20,040
systems so another thing you'll you'll

923
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:23,800
deal with is what's called a

924
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:27,190
reconfigurable Oh a TM or Rotom so Rotom

925
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:29,050
is a software reconfigurable Oh a TM and

926
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:31,600
it's built around a piece of technology

927
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:35,590
called aw SS a wavelength selectable

928
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,700
switch so your common architectures one

929
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:38,890
way to do it is well it's called

930
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,960
broadcast and select so one side is just

931
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:43,120
a passive splitter so if you have

932
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,680
potentially four different ways that you

933
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,850
want to steer a wave you might just take

934
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,080
the light and split it four different

935
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:51,430
ways and then select on the other side

936
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,920
and the other the other method is called

937
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,180
route and select so you're actually

938
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,590
deliberately I steer a wavelength in

939
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,509
this way and then I steer a wavelength

940
00:37:56,590 --> 00:38:01,270
as I it

941
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:02,980
these require a lot of amplification but

942
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,299
it lets you build I'll talk more about

943
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,079
this in a second but let you build more

944
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:10,270
complex more interesting architectures

945
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:11,920
when you think of a Rotom the the most

946
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,630
important thing you think of is what's

947
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,299
called the degree the the different

948
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:18,220
directions that alike to be steered so

949
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:20,980
here's an example of what would be a

950
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,629
four degree Rotom you have you have a

951
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,220
north of South and East and the West

952
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:27,940
that you could potentially steer the

953
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:30,790
traffic plus a local add drop so you can

954
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,200
in in this node I can inject traffic and

955
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:34,450
I can steer it one of these different

956
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,480
directions so I could create new light

957
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:39,790
and send it out like link one or link 2

958
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:43,059
or length three but I can also say I

959
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:44,589
want channel 31 from Direction one to go

960
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:47,589
to direction three I can stitch these

961
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:48,849
together and if you actually look at

962
00:38:47,589 --> 00:38:51,250
that kind of how its constructed

963
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:52,750
internally it's just these these WSS is

964
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:55,809
these wavelength selectable switches

965
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:58,510
with a big array of the big old grid of

966
00:38:55,809 --> 00:39:01,329
one connected to every other possible

967
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:02,980
degree and so you're you're deliberately

968
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:04,930
steering alright I want to I want to

969
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,130
steer this wavelength towards this

970
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,230
direction I let's steer this wavelength

971
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:10,000
towards this direction the more and more

972
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:11,500
and more you do this the larger this

973
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,480
becomes until eventually you have this

974
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:17,740
massive massive pile of fiber

975
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:20,559
interconnecting all these things so if

976
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:23,078
you think about a fixed om the otherwise

977
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:26,079
called a photon or just a just a classic

978
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:28,510
oh idiom you can create these optical

979
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,670
connections between nodes at any point

980
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:32,290
so I you could build a ring like this

981
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,240
you could you could just create run

982
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:36,940
fiber in a ring and you could

983
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:40,240
arbitrarily say I want to connect node

984
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:42,280
one to node seven but it's static it

985
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,319
that this has to be created when you

986
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,290
design the original channel plan and the

987
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:48,279
device that goes in you if you ever want

988
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,808
to change that you have to go out and

989
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,200
swap your hardware so it can be

990
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:55,270
time-consuming it requires a lot of

991
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,069
man-hours to plan and support so if you

992
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,329
you really want to figure out you're off

993
00:39:57,069 --> 00:39:59,740
the whole channel plan you have to put

994
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:02,500
some time and effort into figuring that

995
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:04,390
out beforehand but it's really cheap

996
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,400
it's really simple components it's

997
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:08,290
really cheap it's it's very little

998
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,530
effort goes into it there's very little

999
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:13,200
loss to the whole system

1000
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:16,500
Rotom lets you dynamically connect any

1001
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,419
point so once you deploy a Rotom you

1002
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,370
have complete flexibility you can build

1003
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,900
any optical topology you want you can

1004
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,970
connect any point to any point optically

1005
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,070
you can do it all in software you just

1006
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:27,629
log in to a device and in people build

1007
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:30,000
gooeys around this so you don't need any

1008
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:32,100
specialized knowledge whatsoever but

1009
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,370
it's all built on very expensive very

1010
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:38,069
complex pieces of equipment both in

1011
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:42,390
terms of cost and in terms of optical

1012
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:44,640
performance so there's different kinds

1013
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:47,069
of rotom's so the evolution of the Rotom

1014
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,129
if you follow it from the most basic it

1015
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:53,610
started out as reconfigurable so you

1016
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:55,740
could you could change the channel that

1017
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:58,500
you wanted to add or drop or pass

1018
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:00,720
through but all it did was go like once

1019
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,030
you made the decision to go here then it

1020
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:05,730
would just go to a standard MUX to be

1021
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:07,440
broken out so a specific frequency would

1022
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,900
still be connected to a specific port so

1023
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,820
if you had channel 41 it went to a port

1024
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,830
that was labeled channel 41 and you

1025
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,960
plugged a cable into that and you ran it

1026
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:18,420
into something that said channel 41 on

1027
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,040
your optic on your router and if you

1028
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,160
ever wanted to reconfigure anything you

1029
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,660
had to go send a tech out to reek Abel

1030
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,759
so then they created what's called a

1031
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:30,200
colorless Rotom so that eliminated the

1032
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:34,170
need to map a specific frequency

1033
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:37,140
basically it's it's just a big multicast

1034
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:39,720
array it's a you send the signal out

1035
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:41,580
every different channel and you let the

1036
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:44,750
other side select what it wants to

1037
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:47,610
receive so now I can do things like oh

1038
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:49,410
I'm using channel 41 today but I can

1039
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:51,090
change it to channel 42 tomorrow and all

1040
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:54,450
have to do is log into advice and type

1041
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:56,010
that hit enter and it does it the latest

1042
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:58,470
generation of Rotom is what's called a

1043
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:00,750
CDC a colorless directionless contention

1044
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:03,089
lists so colorless we already said means

1045
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:05,670
that you're not mapping a specific

1046
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:07,860
channel to a specific port directionless

1047
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:10,410
means that you can send the channel any

1048
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:12,900
direction you want so you could send it

1049
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:17,009
in this way east east west or north or

1050
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:18,870
or or not and contention list means that

1051
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:20,910
there's no internal contention I can I

1052
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:22,080
can reuse that same channel multiple

1053
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:24,000
different directions so obviously I

1054
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,950
can't reuse if I have

1055
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,650
channel 41 I can't send to different

1056
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:31,109
channel 40 ones East but I could send

1057
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:34,230
one east one west one north and none of

1058
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:36,390
them would conflict with each other but

1059
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:38,340
so what's the goal here what's the the

1060
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:41,609
whole point of doing a CDC Rotom well

1061
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:44,610
the goal is to make this able to work

1062
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:47,340
entirely in software so you can you can

1063
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:48,990
reconfigure these transponders on two

1064
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:52,020
different paths you could reallocate

1065
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:54,089
them so for example time of day traffic

1066
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:57,690
you might have an off peak and non-peak

1067
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:59,250
where at midnight you might have a lot

1068
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:00,810
of traffic going to Asia and you might

1069
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:03,300
have very little traffic being delivered

1070
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:04,680
locally and as that time shifts you

1071
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,420
might now be sending a lot more traffic

1072
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,690
to Europe and you might be sending a lot

1073
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,100
less to Asia so you could potentially

1074
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:14,430
remap where these individual

1075
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:16,049
transponders are used without having to

1076
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:18,960
buy two of them without having to buy

1077
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:20,970
that extra capacity unless you go out

1078
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,970
and do this dynamically in real time

1079
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:26,069
based on changing conditions so there is

1080
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,700
a lot of standardized work going on in

1081
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,940
the IETF

1082
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:32,970
there's a something called pcap the path

1083
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:37,140
computation element protocol where you

1084
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:39,209
can you can have your network tell your

1085
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:41,400
optical layer I need this amount of

1086
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:43,650
capacity I it looks like I'm sending

1087
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,690
this much please reserve me this amount

1088
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:48,860
of capacity and the optical layer will

1089
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:51,690
go out and map dynamically move around

1090
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:53,550
and reserve that capacity and on the one

1091
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:56,010
hand there's a lot of great potential

1092
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:57,810
for reuse of transponders and making

1093
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:01,590
them more efficient and on the other

1094
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:03,180
hand it makes the transponders less

1095
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:05,400
efficient when they do that in general

1096
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:07,859
so what I mean by that let's let's take

1097
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,780
a look at what actually goes inside of a

1098
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:11,370
modern CDC Rotom it's a it's a little

1099
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,440
piece of black magic that that's

1100
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:15,540
happening here so the very first thing

1101
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,860
you do when you come into a Rotom you

1102
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,320
have to amplify because the Rotom is

1103
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:21,300
about to destroy your signal so you have

1104
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:24,300
to make it really really bright then you

1105
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,400
come in through a very large WSS so

1106
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,080
let's say like a 1 by 20 so you have 20

1107
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:32,040
different possible ways that you can

1108
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:33,960
steer a thing so that is going to cause

1109
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,370
a ton of insertion loss so as soon as

1110
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,800
you come out of that WSS you're going to

1111
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:38,810
need to amplify again

1112
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,330
and then you're going to go into what's

1113
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:43,910
called a multicast array so this is an

1114
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:46,160
example of like an 8 by 16 so you have

1115
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:48,080
these these are rays of amps that take

1116
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,640
these many many many different because

1117
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,740
I'll hit this one by 20 you have 20

1118
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:53,690
different possible degrees 20 different

1119
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:56,000
possible paths on the back end well

1120
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,290
every one of these needs an amp then

1121
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,970
it's going to come into this thing that

1122
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,860
takes it takes this signal it amplifies

1123
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:03,919
it I'll very large number of ports and

1124
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:05,990
then splits it and then on the receiver

1125
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,820
side you you plug into a port and you

1126
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:10,490
say oh I want to tune into channel 21 I

1127
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:12,410
want to tune into channel 22 there's a

1128
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:15,229
lot of complexity that goes on in this

1129
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:17,240
both in terms of absolute dollars and in

1130
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:18,740
terms of what it does to your OS n R

1131
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,270
what it does to your signal quality what

1132
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,220
you're actually able to get out of the

1133
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:23,780
system because of everything that you

1134
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:26,180
put in here so you're trying to strike a

1135
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:28,240
balance do you want that flexibility or

1136
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:34,520
do you want to optimize for performance

1137
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:36,589
and and cost per bit you have a concept

1138
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,840
called DWDM super channel so what's

1139
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:40,610
happening here is imagine what happens

1140
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,210
if you want performance that you can't

1141
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:46,340
actually get out of a single carrier so

1142
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:48,350
here's a simple example say someone came

1143
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:52,160
to you and said I need one terabit

1144
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:53,870
Ethernet how do I do this we don't have

1145
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,640
a technology off-the-shelf that does

1146
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:58,640
that in a single carrier we just don't

1147
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:02,990
write it would be this this massive 320

1148
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:06,589
gigabyte 375 gigahertz wide that we

1149
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:09,529
don't have it doesn't exist you could do

1150
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:12,410
it in two different carriers you could

1151
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:15,860
you could do it as two different 160

1152
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:18,140
Chabad systems or you could do it as 10

1153
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:20,240
different carriers so something that we

1154
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:22,460
absolutely have off-the-shelf that's

1155
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:25,100
been around for many many years is is 10

1156
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:26,930
by 100 but what will happen is you'll

1157
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,819
take those ten different 100 Gig

1158
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:31,009
carriers and you'll you'll cram them

1159
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:32,360
together into a super channel so

1160
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:34,450
sometimes you can just get more

1161
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,220
efficient about the the channel packing

1162
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:39,770
or you can just think of it logically as

1163
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,509
a single you never had the ability to

1164
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:44,210
pull a single one of those out it only

1165
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:45,620
behaved as though it was one larger

1166
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:47,510
channel but it's actually a super

1167
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:50,210
channel of many different sub carriers

1168
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,450
inside that that operate at a level that

1169
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,630
we

1170
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:54,799
actually have the technology to do

1171
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:56,960
there's been a lot of evolution through

1172
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,750
the years on that so the way that it

1173
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,390
used to work is we had these different

1174
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:04,310
different shaped signals and different

1175
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:06,589
line with signals depending on the the

1176
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:09,500
baud rate that we were sending out and

1177
00:47:06,589 --> 00:47:11,420
we would kind of cram them into a here's

1178
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,770
a here's a 50 gigahertz grid whether you

1179
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:14,450
want it or not and it doesn't really

1180
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:15,920
matter how much your your channel

1181
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:19,189
consumes it's going to fit in here it's

1182
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,920
gonna be being lumpy and the the more

1183
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:24,320
modern evolution is that these different

1184
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,000
signals you can actually have a system

1185
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,070
called flex grid that adapts to it so

1186
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,339
you can dynamically tune your channels

1187
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:33,980
to the actual carrier that you need to

1188
00:47:31,339 --> 00:47:37,849
pass so you can be more efficient in

1189
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:40,040
packing your bandwidth you can do newer

1190
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:42,260
optical technologies that are able to to

1191
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,089
do more with higher baud rates and I'll

1192
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:46,010
talk more about that later but there's a

1193
00:47:44,089 --> 00:47:48,290
lot of advantages to that there's a lot

1194
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:50,150
of disadvantages because primarily the

1195
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:52,640
only way that you access a flex grid is

1196
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:54,560
through a very complex program so you

1197
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,210
you have to strike a balance as to

1198
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:58,369
whether you really really really care

1199
00:47:56,210 --> 00:48:02,200
about that that spectral efficiency or

1200
00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:06,920
not so some more optical networking

1201
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:09,560
components DCM dispersion cut you'll

1202
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,359
hear this set is either DCU or DCM so

1203
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:14,480
either dispersion compensating units or

1204
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:16,640
dispersion compensating modules both are

1205
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:20,720
used interchangeably and I use them both

1206
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:23,240
interchangeably all the time so

1207
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,970
basically it's originally started out as

1208
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,919
a big spool of fiber in a box and it was

1209
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:29,689
designed to cause dispersion that was

1210
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,020
the opposite direction the opposite

1211
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:35,300
slope of the transmissions fiber so

1212
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:37,369
imagine you run through 80 kilometers of

1213
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,960
fiber out in the field you get to the

1214
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:40,339
end and then you run through a spool of

1215
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,599
fiber that's designed to cause

1216
00:48:40,339 --> 00:48:43,160
dispersion the opposite direction it's

1217
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,680
designed to squish the signal back

1218
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:47,750
together and by the end of it you come

1219
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,430
out and hope that you're pretty close to

1220
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:52,880
what the the signal was originally

1221
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:55,549
before you put it in there it that's

1222
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,960
effective the original designs built

1223
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:59,780
around this dispersion compensating

1224
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,890
fiber added about 20 percent to the

1225
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:04,250
fiber distance because you these big

1226
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:06,680
spools so that caused latency

1227
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:09,410
and the the newer designs were based on

1228
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:11,118
FBG so you actually had a small fiber

1229
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:14,990
Bragg grating that created the same

1230
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:16,910
effect that had lower lower latency but

1231
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:18,350
this had to be specifically mapped to

1232
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:19,700
your channel plan it doesn't line well

1233
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:20,890
this channel so you you actually still

1234
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,879
see both systems that are out there

1235
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:27,440
depending on what you're actually trying

1236
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,850
to accomplish there's a component out

1237
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,330
there called an optical switch so

1238
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:34,970
basically this is just a way to steer

1239
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:36,560
light at a purely optical level without

1240
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:38,359
having to go for an optical to

1241
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,240
electrical to optical you're able to

1242
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:43,640
steer light so one way to do this is

1243
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:45,890
with what's called 3d MEMS these these

1244
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,660
tiny microscopic mirrors that are

1245
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:50,150
electrostatically controlled and you can

1246
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:52,759
you can aim the mirror so you can say a

1247
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:55,250
meso I in this way in this way and

1248
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:58,580
you're able to to steer the light from

1249
00:49:55,250 --> 00:50:01,400
port 1 to 40 to 43 so these things are

1250
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:03,650
very popular in automated cross-connect

1251
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:05,060
systems so people who don't want to go

1252
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:07,940
out there and run structure cabling and

1253
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:09,290
go plug a cable in they can they can

1254
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:11,810
just do this remotely through software

1255
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:13,820
they're also commonly used in lab

1256
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:15,830
scenarios so if you you reconfigure

1257
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,359
things on a regular basis it's a lot

1258
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:19,549
easier to do it in software than it is

1259
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:23,900
to to go send a tech out there to move

1260
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:25,430
cables around a WSS I talked about

1261
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,800
earlier a wavelength selectable switch

1262
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:31,190
is the the component that lets you route

1263
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:33,650
an individual wavelength so the first

1264
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:36,470
generation ones were built on these 3d

1265
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:38,030
MEMS technologies the newest ones are

1266
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:41,149
actually built on what's called L cost

1267
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:42,920
liquid crystalline silicon so it kind of

1268
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:45,050
functions similar to remember the old

1269
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:46,609
projector TVs that we used to have

1270
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:49,490
before we had flat screens everywhere

1271
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:51,140
it's a very similar kind of a concept

1272
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:54,770
there's a lot of advanced engineering

1273
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:56,779
that goes into breaking these things out

1274
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:58,609
and having these L cost filters that can

1275
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:00,050
they can filter specific frequencies and

1276
00:50:58,609 --> 00:51:02,150
then send it the direction that you want

1277
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:03,980
to go that's why these tend to be these

1278
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:08,270
very expensive very advanced components

1279
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:10,790
a circulator is is something that you

1280
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:12,890
generally don't see as an end user but

1281
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:16,370
it's it's often a part of these internal

1282
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:18,710
components the way a circulator works is

1283
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:20,359
light comes in port one he goes out port

1284
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:22,340
two light comes in port two it goes out

1285
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,350
port three so if something is reflected

1286
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:26,150
it'll go out one port and if something

1287
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:28,430
is not reflected it'll pass through

1288
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:31,760
another port so here's an example of how

1289
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:35,419
how you make an oem using an FBG and a

1290
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,070
circulator you you take your you etch

1291
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:38,660
and FBG you create this piece of fiber

1292
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:40,130
that has these small edgings in it that

1293
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:42,649
will reflect a certain frequency of

1294
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:46,310
light and by using the two circulators

1295
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:48,140
on the either end if it's the frequency

1296
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:50,330
you care about then it's reflected and

1297
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:52,400
it's dropped or added so you can have a

1298
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:53,779
local break out and if it's not then

1299
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,650
it's passed through harmlessly and

1300
00:51:53,780 --> 00:52:00,350
continues from one fibre to the other an

1301
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:02,120
optical splitter does exactly what it

1302
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:04,390
sounds like it does it splits a signal

1303
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:07,640
so some of the most common examples

1304
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:09,589
you've got a 50/50 splitter so you'll

1305
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,720
often see this used in your really

1306
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:14,690
simple basic optical protection you'll

1307
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,980
you for example here's two fibers I want

1308
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:18,920
to take this signal and send it down

1309
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:20,480
both of them put a 50-50 split or in

1310
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,610
front of it you send the exact same

1311
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,500
light both different directions and you

1312
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:26,300
have a small optical switch on the other

1313
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:28,940
side that's generally just looking at

1314
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,650
power so it says whichever one has the

1315
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:32,570
brightest signal I'm gonna use and if I

1316
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:34,850
suddenly see the signal go away then I

1317
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:37,970
switch to the other one so it's a really

1318
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:39,230
really easy cheap way to protect a whole

1319
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:40,700
bunch potentially I mean this could be

1320
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:41,900
this could be seventy six point eight

1321
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:44,419
terabytes of capacity that you're

1322
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:48,920
protecting with a single device to send

1323
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:51,980
to different fiber routes you also see a

1324
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:54,680
99 one or 98 two or 95 five depending on

1325
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:57,050
the exact specifics but it's a a very

1326
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,640
small splitter you'll see used for

1327
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:01,100
what's called opium optical performance

1328
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,870
monitor so what happens here is you you

1329
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,400
split off a very small percentage of

1330
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:06,259
signal and you send it to a spectrum

1331
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,330
analyzer so now you can look at it

1332
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:10,400
remotely and you can actually say what's

1333
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:13,040
actually going across this fiber and I

1334
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,230
am I am is oh my oh s are good or my

1335
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,930
channels good or my power level good you

1336
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:19,640
are able to look at the whole thing from

1337
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:22,430
from a sample point where you have a

1338
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,379
small splitter and a lot of muxes and

1339
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:27,319
things like that and amps will have

1340
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:29,640
these little monitor ports built-in you

1341
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,859
also have a 1 by n splitter

1342
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:34,038
so this is used in like multi point

1343
00:53:31,859 --> 00:53:36,450
distribution so for example cable TV

1344
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:38,069
what you'll have is like a 32 by

1345
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:40,049
splitter so you take the same signal of

1346
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:41,910
light you amplify it so it's really

1347
00:53:40,049 --> 00:53:43,170
bright and then you split it 32 times

1348
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:44,578
and you send it to different

1349
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:47,220
distribution points because you're

1350
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:50,970
sending the same signal to many

1351
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:53,069
different places so optical

1352
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:54,709
amplification this is its whole whole

1353
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:58,710
genetic about this

1354
00:53:54,710 --> 00:54:00,630
so amplification is how you increase the

1355
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:03,359
intensity of a signal in a purely

1356
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:05,549
optical fashion you're not regenerating

1357
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:07,589
the signal year there's no electrical

1358
00:54:05,549 --> 00:54:09,480
components that that care about ones and

1359
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:12,450
zeros you never decode the signal you

1360
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,519
just make it brighter there's different

1361
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:16,980
different types of amplifiers that do

1362
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:18,930
this and there are different names for

1363
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,970
the designs depending on where they're

1364
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:23,788
at in the system so the three most

1365
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:25,558
common types for where they're at in the

1366
00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:28,499
system are the booster the preamp and

1367
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:29,910
the inline so the booster does what it

1368
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:32,910
sounds like it makes a brake signal

1369
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:34,859
brighter so it's generally used when

1370
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:36,118
you're trying to transmit and you you

1371
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:38,489
want to make this as bright as you

1372
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:41,819
possibly can before you send it out so

1373
00:54:38,489 --> 00:54:44,999
you get the best performance a preamp is

1374
00:54:41,819 --> 00:54:46,739
used to kind of precondition the signal

1375
00:54:44,999 --> 00:54:49,109
before you receive it so it takes a weak

1376
00:54:46,739 --> 00:54:51,779
signal it makes it brighter it's it's

1377
00:54:49,109 --> 00:54:53,670
optimized for low input powers and to do

1378
00:54:51,779 --> 00:54:55,920
this with minimal noise so you use that

1379
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:57,359
at the end and an inline amp is

1380
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,329
something that kind of strikes a balance

1381
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:03,119
between the two so you might use that at

1382
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:04,470
a if you're not breaking out a signal

1383
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,849
you're just passing through here's an 80

1384
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:08,220
kilometer span going to another 80

1385
00:55:05,849 --> 00:55:09,660
kilometer span you might use an inline

1386
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:12,078
amp that's that's striking the balance

1387
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,078
of the two

1388
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:17,339
so two different kinds of amplifiers out

1389
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:19,200
there the most common one the the most

1390
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:21,529
pervasive I by far is what's called the

1391
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:25,680
ED feh the erbium doped fiber amplifier

1392
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:28,019
so the way this works you have a small

1393
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:31,319
piece of fiber it's generally like 1

1394
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:33,808
meter 2 meters and it's doped so in the

1395
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:37,109
creation of the fiber itself there's you

1396
00:55:33,809 --> 00:55:39,400
know one part per million of erbium ions

1397
00:55:37,109 --> 00:55:42,790
that are that are in here

1398
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:44,140
and you you inject another laser into it

1399
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:46,750
so you you come along with a specific

1400
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:48,190
frequency of laser so for ED fit happens

1401
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:51,880
to be nine eighty and fourteen eighty

1402
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:54,220
and you inject this pump laser into the

1403
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:56,230
doped fiber what happens is the pump

1404
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:59,500
laser comes along and it hits these

1405
00:55:56,230 --> 00:56:01,900
erbium electric ions and it bumps the

1406
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:04,180
electron into an elevated state so you

1407
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:07,270
move up to a higher energy State and

1408
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:08,620
then when the cbn frequency when the

1409
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:10,480
signal that you're actually trying to

1410
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:13,630
transmit when one of those photons comes

1411
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,820
along and hits that excited erbium ion

1412
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:17,740
it causes it to emit a clone of the

1413
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:20,080
photon and to drop back down to the

1414
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:21,910
lower energy State so that's all that's

1415
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,950
happening the reason for the two

1416
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:25,450
different pump lasers is that's a way

1417
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:27,819
that you can pump the most amount of

1418
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:31,330
power into the system there's two

1419
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:33,130
different states so once called the the

1420
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:34,630
unstable State so you can you can pump

1421
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:36,340
at 980 and it goes all the way up to the

1422
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:37,720
height to the second level and then it

1423
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,880
immediately falls back down to the first

1424
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:43,600
if you pump at fourteen eighty you go to

1425
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:46,390
the quasi stable State but you you

1426
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:48,970
elevate this electron good photon comes

1427
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:52,299
along hits it emits a clone you've left

1428
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:54,040
with a brighter signal so why can't we

1429
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:56,080
do this forever right this this sounds

1430
00:56:54,040 --> 00:57:00,790
genius this is amazing why do we why do

1431
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:03,730
we need to ever do anything else well if

1432
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:06,550
you don't so when you use this good

1433
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:09,700
state you have about 10 milliseconds is

1434
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:11,800
the the magic window of which you have

1435
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:13,600
for a good photon to come along if a

1436
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,910
good photon does not come along within

1437
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:19,000
ten milliseconds to hit this excited or

1438
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:21,910
VM ion then it will spontaneously decay

1439
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,560
and emit what's called a SC amplified

1440
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:27,730
spontaneous emission otherwise known as

1441
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:29,590
noise once you emit this noise it's

1442
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:31,150
completely indistinguishable from your

1443
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:32,560
original signal there's no way you can

1444
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:36,430
ever tell the difference there's no way

1445
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:39,430
you can decode it here's an example of a

1446
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:42,100
graph showing you know here's to good

1447
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:44,500
clean signals and how how high they are

1448
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:47,110
there's nice laser Peaks but you see

1449
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,790
that that big curve of noise there

1450
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:50,890
that's all junk that's all stuff that

1451
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:52,900
you didn't want in your signal that has

1452
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:55,210
has no actual signal transmitted

1453
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,799
did it and after you do this enough

1454
00:57:55,210 --> 00:58:01,150
eventually you you become completely

1455
00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:03,640
indistinguishable again so this diagram

1456
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:05,619
what I'm trying to show is one of the

1457
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:10,288
things that that people don't understand

1458
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:14,019
is the input power directly relates to

1459
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:16,599
how well your output power will be so in

1460
00:58:14,019 --> 00:58:20,078
this example if I were to let the signal

1461
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:22,210
go five DB before i amplify it so that's

1462
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:24,789
this top blue line if I was to let the

1463
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:26,380
signal go five DB amplify it and then go

1464
00:58:24,789 --> 00:58:28,450
five to V again and then amplify it and

1465
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:32,049
then five DB again and amplify it and I

1466
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:35,259
did that ten hops I would finish those

1467
00:58:32,049 --> 00:58:37,509
ten hops almost the exact same OSR so if

1468
00:58:35,259 --> 00:58:41,440
I started with a 24 DB SNR I'd be it

1469
00:58:37,509 --> 00:58:44,259
like 23.9 the lower you let the input

1470
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:47,380
signal get before you amplify it the

1471
00:58:44,259 --> 00:58:49,539
higher a proportion of time there is the

1472
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:51,640
greater the chance that those ten

1473
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:53,890
milliseconds expire the good photon

1474
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:56,589
doesn't come in and you emit noise so

1475
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:58,118
the lower you let it get the the weaker

1476
00:58:56,589 --> 00:59:01,058
the the less able you're able to

1477
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:02,589
continue this so in an ideal world you'd

1478
00:59:01,059 --> 00:59:04,859
be able to amplify constantly you'd be

1479
00:59:02,589 --> 00:59:06,700
able to amplify every ten kilometers

1480
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:08,558
problem being that's really expensive

1481
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,149
and really difficult to do so we tried

1482
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:12,849
to strike a balance we tried to amplify

1483
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:15,849
enough to not let the signal be degraded

1484
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:18,130
but you know you could let it go to 120

1485
00:59:15,849 --> 00:59:20,170
kilometers but you even though you

1486
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:22,210
amplified the signal and even though it

1487
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:24,880
comes out bright because you let it get

1488
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:28,599
so low first you've added a lot of noise

1489
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:30,880
to the system the other kind of

1490
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:31,809
amplification besides at VII is called

1491
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,849
Robin

1492
00:59:31,809 --> 00:59:35,529
so Raman amplification works on a

1493
00:59:33,849 --> 00:59:39,549
principle called stimulated Raman

1494
00:59:35,529 --> 00:59:41,950
scattering it's actually a bad thing

1495
00:59:39,549 --> 00:59:43,239
when it happens unintentionally but if

1496
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:47,169
you use it intentionally it's a good

1497
00:59:43,239 --> 00:59:49,900
thing and the way this works is you you

1498
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:52,119
actually use the fiber itself you use

1499
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:54,579
the transmission fiber itself as the

1500
00:59:52,119 --> 00:59:56,470
gain medium so in an info it's what's

1501
00:59:54,579 --> 00:59:58,089
called a lump design right you you have

1502
00:59:56,470 --> 01:00:00,730
this little tiny spool fiber and you

1503
00:59:58,089 --> 01:00:03,339
come in and after you leave this full of

1504
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:06,520
fiber the signals brighter in a Raman

1505
01:00:03,339 --> 01:00:09,430
system you actually put a pump laser on

1506
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:11,620
to the transmission fiber and it makes

1507
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:13,089
the signal brighter as it's propagating

1508
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:15,880
as it's coming to you it gets brighter

1509
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:16,750
and the best way to do Raman because of

1510
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,370
this effect is what's called

1511
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:20,950
counter-propagating so you actually send

1512
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:22,240
it send it backwards so if the the good

1513
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:25,149
signal is coming this way

1514
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,919
you send your Raman pump this way so

1515
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:29,110
here's what this looks like from a

1516
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:30,910
function of energy transfer so you have

1517
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:32,470
your your probe your your good signal

1518
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:35,920
coming this way and you have your Raman

1519
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:37,629
pump laser going this way and SRS the

1520
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,540
stimulated Raman scattering is actually

1521
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:43,600
a power transfer you you drain the power

1522
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:46,060
from one frequency and you transfer the

1523
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:48,339
power to another frequency so at the end

1524
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:50,770
of this you have a depleted pump going

1525
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:52,870
one way which is filtered out later and

1526
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:54,280
you have your your brighter signal that

1527
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:59,259
you actually care about going the other

1528
01:00:54,280 --> 01:01:01,420
way the reason that that matters so if

1529
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:03,490
you look at ed felony amplification it's

1530
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:07,210
very linear right so you you start out

1531
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:09,129
and it as you as you amplify you make

1532
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:11,290
the signal brighter and then it goes and

1533
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:12,940
it loses power over time over time over

1534
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:16,210
time and a certain point you amplify

1535
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:18,070
again it gets brighter but the two

1536
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:20,140
things you care about are the high end

1537
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:22,000
and the low end when you make a signal

1538
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:24,190
to bright you create something called

1539
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,280
nonlinear effects and I'll talk a lot

1540
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:29,710
more about that in a second but you

1541
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,090
don't want it to be too bright you you

1542
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:32,200
there's a certain amount of power that

1543
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:33,550
you can put into the system and

1544
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:35,770
eventually you've hit that limit and it

1545
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:37,420
causes all these issues and like I said

1546
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:39,460
before you don't want it to be too weak

1547
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:42,010
either if you let the signal get too low

1548
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:44,890
then when you amplify you create all

1549
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:46,540
this noise and you're you're you lose

1550
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:49,480
your own are you never never able to

1551
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:52,870
recover the signal that you put in if

1552
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:56,200
you use Ed feh and Raman together here's

1553
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:59,170
what happens on the one end you don't

1554
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:01,060
need to transmit as high because I've

1555
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:02,980
got another form of amplification I

1556
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:04,630
don't need to suffer look the black line

1557
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:07,060
was what I had to do when it was an ed

1558
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:08,500
felony system I had just I had to start

1559
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:10,870
out high I had to start out so high that

1560
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:13,180
I went into this nonlinear zone now I

1561
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:14,680
don't need to now I I can use an ED fuh

1562
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:16,690
but I can use it at a lower power level

1563
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:19,930
so I stay out of them on linear region

1564
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:22,270
and then as I as the

1565
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:24,069
signal comes in you see the the ramen

1566
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:26,170
pump that counter-propagating pump going

1567
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:28,330
backwards you see the the signal

1568
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:29,470
actually starts to stop getting dimmer

1569
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:30,730
and gets brighter brighter brighter

1570
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:32,620
brighter brighter brighter brighter and

1571
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:36,520
so as it comes in actually start out at

1572
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:38,109
a much brighter signal so now I go into

1573
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:39,970
a net VII again but I've done it at a

1574
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:42,580
better way I've done it with a brighter

1575
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:44,259
signal so my edge was more effective so

1576
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:46,299
I'm able to carry that signal a lot

1577
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:49,030
further and the combination of these two

1578
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:50,800
is is very very effective and much more

1579
01:02:49,030 --> 01:02:54,100
effective than either one used

1580
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:56,620
independently so here's an example of

1581
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:59,890
how that works let's say for example

1582
01:02:56,620 --> 01:03:01,839
that you had a 21 DB OS star this is

1583
01:02:59,890 --> 01:03:05,470
this was a target that you had for a

1584
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:08,680
particular transponder when we did it as

1585
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:12,160
an edge only you see the the blue curve

1586
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:16,210
here we fell below the 23 DB or the the

1587
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:19,720
21 DB o SNR line after seven hops so if

1588
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:21,880
for example we had 100 kilometre hops we

1589
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:24,279
had seven of them we went 700 kilometers

1590
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,260
and then we lost the signal so we would

1591
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:29,170
not be able if a customer came and said

1592
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:31,000
I needed an 800 kilometer signal we

1593
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:33,820
wouldn't be able to do it with this kind

1594
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,770
of a transponder if you look at the

1595
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:38,530
performance gain of using edge found

1596
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:41,050
raman we take it all the way to 2,000

1597
01:03:38,530 --> 01:03:43,900
kilometres we can go now to 20 hops of

1598
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:46,030
the exact same kind of kind of distance

1599
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:49,840
and still keep that that really high

1600
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:52,180
signal quality and still send that

1601
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:54,520
signal so it's a tremendous tremendous

1602
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:58,899
win in terms of performance over

1603
01:03:54,520 --> 01:04:01,390
distance when you amplify you also have

1604
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:02,710
to about balance the power so these

1605
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:05,170
amplifiers are creating these own

1606
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:07,210
they're their own unique issues you

1607
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:08,920
don't want a situation where one channel

1608
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:11,520
is significantly brighter than the other

1609
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:15,670
one it would cause OSN are issues you

1610
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:17,860
you if one channel is significantly

1611
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:20,170
brighter than the other then it's going

1612
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:22,240
to lower the amplification that happens

1613
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:25,540
on that dimmer channel and it's going to

1614
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:27,129
come across and have problems so what

1615
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:29,710
you what you do to try to compensate for

1616
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:31,690
this is the most basic thing is

1617
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:33,330
something called a GF f AG light a gain

1618
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:37,820
flattening filter

1619
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:39,990
it's basically a statically designed

1620
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:41,310
attenuation thing that's designed to

1621
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:43,890
kind of flatten this out so it's it's

1622
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:45,590
generally matched to your Etna and it's

1623
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:48,900
generally a part of the amplifier itself

1624
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:50,490
so what actually comes out of an ephah

1625
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,930
might be it might look like this right

1626
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:54,600
one one channel is significantly

1627
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:56,879
brighter than the other but inside of

1628
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:58,470
the Yetta it has a filter that tries to

1629
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,930
flatten that out so that all the

1630
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:03,330
channels are consistently bright and a

1631
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:05,339
lot of what you do in a complex optical

1632
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:06,390
network is make it brighter and then

1633
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:08,010
make it dimmer and they make it brighter

1634
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:09,540
again and then make it dimmer so you've

1635
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:11,190
probably played this battle back and

1636
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:13,800
forth trying to keep everything balanced

1637
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:15,300
and you can do this with a with a static

1638
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,190
map for for quite a bit but eventually

1639
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,120
you you hit a point where you need to do

1640
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:20,790
it's called dge

1641
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:22,130
dynamic gain Equalization so that means

1642
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:24,870
you need to have something that actually

1643
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:27,000
intelligently without trying to be

1644
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:30,210
statically mapped at manufacturing to

1645
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,130
the the Yetta tries to rebalance alright

1646
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:33,950
this this one needs to come one DB down

1647
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:37,620
this one needs to go one DB higher

1648
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:40,290
generally that's done with a Rotom so in

1649
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:42,359
a complex Rotem network you'll see often

1650
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:44,250
but every seven hops something like that

1651
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:46,230
six or seven hops you'll see a road and

1652
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:48,930
put in just to do channel equalization

1653
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:53,430
even if it doesn't need to steer a

1654
01:05:48,930 --> 01:05:56,700
frequency amplifiers are also limited in

1655
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:58,649
their total system power so you have a

1656
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:00,419
limit in what you can put in and what

1657
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:02,760
you can take out so here's an easy way

1658
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:05,640
to think about this imagine a single

1659
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:08,610
channel is 0 DBM so it's 1 milliwatt of

1660
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:11,549
input power if you have 40 of those

1661
01:06:08,610 --> 01:06:16,170
channels it's actually 40 milliwatts of

1662
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:18,480
input power or 16 DBM of input power so

1663
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:21,840
if your amplifier is max power max input

1664
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:24,300
power is negative 6 and you run all 40

1665
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:29,250
channels that means you have to the

1666
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:31,350
signal has to be negative a Phi it if it

1667
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:34,820
gets any brighter than that you would

1668
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:38,520
saturate the amp so you have to design

1669
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:42,090
if you want high channel count systems

1670
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:45,810
you are automatically forced into low

1671
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:46,599
powers waiting for your advocate low

1672
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:49,509
before you amp

1673
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:51,789
by the the more channels you add to the

1674
01:06:49,509 --> 01:06:54,069
system the less power you can have on

1675
01:06:51,789 --> 01:06:55,690
any individual channel and so many

1676
01:06:54,069 --> 01:06:57,519
systems if you if you want to optimize

1677
01:06:55,690 --> 01:07:00,759
if you really want to optimize for

1678
01:06:57,519 --> 01:07:03,069
performance cutting channels out is a

1679
01:07:00,759 --> 01:07:05,200
great way to do that if you if you cut

1680
01:07:03,069 --> 01:07:07,538
it from 80 channels to 40 channels or 20

1681
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:10,989
channels every time you do that you make

1682
01:07:07,539 --> 01:07:12,190
it double the potential OSN are double

1683
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:14,589
the amount of signal that you could

1684
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:17,529
actually transmit per individual channel

1685
01:07:14,589 --> 01:07:20,440
to a certain point and this also happens

1686
01:07:17,529 --> 01:07:23,170
as you as you change channels so imagine

1687
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:24,759
for example you had a pop you had the

1688
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:26,499
power go out in one of your locations

1689
01:07:24,759 --> 01:07:28,180
and so suddenly a whole bunch of

1690
01:07:26,499 --> 01:07:30,669
channels are knocked offline that

1691
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:33,578
directly changes the optical power

1692
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:36,249
that's inside the system so a good ed

1693
01:07:33,579 --> 01:07:39,489
fan needs to react to this so the the

1694
01:07:36,249 --> 01:07:40,959
even the the basic ones will will have a

1695
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:43,140
feedback loop and we'll look for power

1696
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,640
changes and will control how much they

1697
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:47,440
they they adjust their gain and the best

1698
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,029
ED fuzz will actually communicate

1699
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,680
they'll have an OSC he'll have a control

1700
01:07:49,029 --> 01:07:53,289
channel that talks to the other Ed fuzz

1701
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:54,669
further down the line to tell each other

1702
01:07:53,289 --> 01:07:57,160
what they're seeing about the line

1703
01:07:54,670 --> 01:08:00,729
conditions and to work together to

1704
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:04,229
affect the signal some more optical

1705
01:08:00,729 --> 01:08:07,689
networks and concepts because a few more

1706
01:08:04,229 --> 01:08:10,029
forward error correction so this is very

1707
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:13,299
very important in everything that we do

1708
01:08:10,029 --> 01:08:17,170
from how do we actually encode data on

1709
01:08:13,299 --> 01:08:19,109
the line so feck is a way to add extra

1710
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:21,399
redundant information so that you can

1711
01:08:19,109 --> 01:08:24,190
computationally recover from it on the

1712
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:27,129
other end so think of it like raid 5 for

1713
01:08:24,189 --> 01:08:29,799
your your wave you add a little bit more

1714
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:31,779
signal so for example you a 10 gig

1715
01:08:29,799 --> 01:08:34,269
signal a 10 gig e signal is ten point

1716
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:36,609
three to five gigabits well if you bump

1717
01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:38,980
it to eleven if you if you bump it seven

1718
01:08:36,609 --> 01:08:41,469
percent overhead you can actually take

1719
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:43,718
that same signal and now carry it 120

1720
01:08:41,469 --> 01:08:47,170
kilometers instead of 80 and still

1721
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:49,509
decode the signal on the other end so

1722
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:53,380
this really matters when you're working

1723
01:08:49,509 --> 01:08:55,359
with legacy DWDM systems because it's

1724
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:58,118
generally not practical to go out and

1725
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:59,859
move the amp sites you know if you could

1726
01:08:58,118 --> 01:09:00,460
you could deploy a system we're great we

1727
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:02,230
could double

1728
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:04,029
our capacity we could cut our cost in

1729
01:09:02,229 --> 01:09:05,830
half if only I could go move every one

1730
01:09:04,029 --> 01:09:07,540
of my huts so that they were 70

1731
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:09,640
kilometers apart instead of 80 it

1732
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:11,560
doesn't work that way you've got to work

1733
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:14,290
with what you what you have so feck ends

1734
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,859
up being really critical in making that

1735
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:16,719
possible

1736
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:19,000
and there's a couple generations effect

1737
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:20,799
that we've we've worked with so the

1738
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,770
first gin is something called RS feck

1739
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:25,359
reed-solomon feck and it's it's really

1740
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:27,790
simple really straightforward this is

1741
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:30,460
the the one that you see kind of baked

1742
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:33,310
into many many modern protocols so if

1743
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:36,489
you do 100 Gig sr4 it's it's built in

1744
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:38,380
there using our spec and it's a 6%

1745
01:09:36,488 --> 01:09:40,809
overhead you got about six DB of net

1746
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:42,460
coding gain of you know improved OS NR

1747
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:44,859
that you were able to work with you can

1748
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:46,180
go six DB lower and still decode the

1749
01:09:44,859 --> 01:09:48,279
signal than you would if you didn't

1750
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:50,560
effect there was a second generation

1751
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:52,509
effect called effec where they added

1752
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,310
slightly more overhead and got slightly

1753
01:09:52,509 --> 01:09:56,620
better performance

1754
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:58,239
the modern feck actually adds a lot more

1755
01:09:56,620 --> 01:10:01,890
overhead so it's something called soft

1756
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:05,799
soft decision feck it doesn't actually

1757
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:09,460
for sure tell you whether something is

1758
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:12,190
is was a 1 or a 0 but it helps influence

1759
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:14,739
the coherent transponder and I'll talk

1760
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:17,710
more about that later but it it informs

1761
01:10:14,739 --> 01:10:19,540
the DSP what part of the constellation

1762
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:22,360
what it was you think she were trying to

1763
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:25,300
decode and so it's it uses a lot more

1764
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:28,049
overhead but it gets you you know 1 to 2

1765
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:30,100
1 to 2 DB gain and no SNR can be

1766
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:31,750
hundreds of kilometers right it can be a

1767
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:35,050
massive massive increase in performance

1768
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:37,510
so this is the the modern version is all

1769
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:40,000
built around soft decision fact and like

1770
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:42,550
I said effect is is key in things like

1771
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,580
hundred gig sr4 and and all kinds of

1772
01:10:42,550 --> 01:10:47,380
things that we we use and think of as

1773
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:50,650
client optics actually have feck built

1774
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:53,110
into them or required on the host board

1775
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:54,700
as a part of the protocol so here's

1776
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:57,820
here's kind of an example of how that

1777
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:59,559
works right so the blue line is what

1778
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:02,590
would happen so it's your bit error rate

1779
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:04,090
versus euro SNR so as your OS n R gets

1780
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:06,700
lower and lower and lower as you go to

1781
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:08,710
the left your bit error rate gets higher

1782
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:11,710
and higher and higher and you know when

1783
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:14,019
you're if you were to lose you come down

1784
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:15,550
to 10 DB of own are your your

1785
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:17,469
bit error rate is ten to the negative

1786
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:20,320
three that's that's terrible you're

1787
01:11:17,469 --> 01:11:21,309
getting a huge number of the packets

1788
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,768
have errors and that wouldn't be a

1789
01:11:21,309 --> 01:11:25,389
usable signal but if you have a good

1790
01:11:23,769 --> 01:11:27,999
modern effects system on it you're able

1791
01:11:25,389 --> 01:11:29,619
to go all the way down to 9 DB before

1792
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:48,280
you you hit this cliff and you start to

1793
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:52,389
lose your signal it's tired oh okay come

1794
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:58,210
back all right

1795
01:11:52,389 --> 01:12:02,730
ah so another concept is called OTN so G

1796
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:05,260
dot 709 or OTN digital rapper technology

1797
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:09,549
sorry it's not here so the way this

1798
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:12,840
works o TN is a modern replacement for

1799
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:15,760
for for sonet and sdh it's a way to take

1800
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:17,860
lower speed signals and MUX them

1801
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:20,190
together so that you're able to

1802
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:23,460
transport them across an optical network

1803
01:12:20,190 --> 01:12:26,919
so it works like a rapper right so you

1804
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:29,619
imagine you have a one gig signal coming

1805
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:32,050
in you might want to run that across a

1806
01:12:29,619 --> 01:12:34,719
you might run 10/10 one gig signals

1807
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:36,880
across a 10 gig optical carrier or

1808
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:38,920
modern version of that might be 10 10

1809
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:40,599
gig signals or a hundred one gig signals

1810
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:43,869
across a single hunter gig optical

1811
01:12:40,599 --> 01:12:46,900
carrier OTN is the protocol that lets

1812
01:12:43,869 --> 01:12:49,360
you individually tell what those those

1813
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:51,460
things are so it carries some of that

1814
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:53,920
that debugging information right you can

1815
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:56,230
see where the different components are

1816
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:59,860
along the way you can tell what the

1817
01:12:56,230 --> 01:13:01,570
thing is so maybe I'm carrying a Giggy

1818
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:03,429
maybe I'm carrying an old SONET signal

1819
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:05,949
maybe I'm carrying frame relay still

1820
01:13:03,429 --> 01:13:07,449
maybe maybe someone still has an ATM

1821
01:13:05,949 --> 01:13:11,320
card that they're they're running across

1822
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:13,299
this OTN lets you tell what it is and

1823
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:16,449
lets you MUX many of these different

1824
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:18,340
independent signals together in a way

1825
01:13:16,449 --> 01:13:20,289
that's that's modern so think of it as

1826
01:13:18,340 --> 01:13:24,519
the the modern replacement for kind of

1827
01:13:20,289 --> 01:13:26,440
sonet and sdh different types of single

1828
01:13:24,519 --> 01:13:28,030
mode fiber that are out there

1829
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:31,269
so I already said that there's many

1830
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:33,160
different kinds and single-mode is used

1831
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:33,960
in almost all of your long reach

1832
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:37,420
applications

1833
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:39,489
so the the basic common standard one

1834
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:43,020
that you hear about the most is what's

1835
01:13:39,489 --> 01:13:45,849
called G dot six five - so that's

1836
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:48,370
standard single-mode fiber otherwise

1837
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:49,780
known as SM f28 that's a product name

1838
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:52,690
but you'll hear people call it that

1839
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:54,610
that's just the standard stuff there's a

1840
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:59,410
kind called full-spectrum or low water

1841
01:13:54,610 --> 01:14:02,259
peak fiber so that's actually modern 65

1842
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:04,750
- kind of assumed that so modern fiber

1843
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:06,760
if you were just by regular standard

1844
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:09,340
fiber is low water peak fiber and it

1845
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:12,070
would just be 6 5 2 D would be the

1846
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:14,440
latest revision of that standard so that

1847
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:16,389
it can work with as many channels as

1848
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:18,879
possible there's a kind called

1849
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:21,280
dispersion shifted fiber there's a kind

1850
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,770
called cutoff shifted low loss fiber so

1851
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:27,820
that's that's your submarine cable type

1852
01:14:23,770 --> 01:14:29,679
systems whole bunch of guides so your

1853
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:32,019
your standard single-mode fiber this is

1854
01:14:29,679 --> 01:14:34,960
the one that is the widest deploy ills

1855
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:36,489
and all your original cables anything

1856
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,429
that was out there early fiber days

1857
01:14:36,489 --> 01:14:41,199
still there and most most modern things

1858
01:14:39,429 --> 01:14:46,060
they go out there are still some variant

1859
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:48,549
of this like I said SM f28 as a corning

1860
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:51,070
brand-name but it could be anything you

1861
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:55,690
can also call it in D SF non dispersion

1862
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:57,699
shifted fiber so the original s MF that

1863
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:59,049
was out there was designed for for 1310

1864
01:14:57,699 --> 01:15:01,150
that was what it was really optimized

1865
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:04,150
for and that's the point of lowest

1866
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:07,299
dispersion and this is all fiber that

1867
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:09,759
was created before the invention of WDM

1868
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:12,340
so remember wave division multiplexing

1869
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:16,150
is a relatively modern invention right

1870
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:17,590
it's it's barely 20 27 years old so

1871
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:21,429
there was a lot of fiber that was

1872
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:24,070
deployed when the the premise was just

1873
01:15:21,429 --> 01:15:26,560
to go out there and run a single channel

1874
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:27,969
and that was that was all people knew so

1875
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,800
ironically it's actually come full

1876
01:15:27,969 --> 01:15:32,140
circle - this is now the kind of fiber

1877
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:34,810
that we we want to deploy on new systems

1878
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:36,969
but for many many years we spent

1879
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:38,770
creating new kinds of fiber to go out

1880
01:15:36,969 --> 01:15:39,550
and deploy thinking that we were solving

1881
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:41,470
problems

1882
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:43,960
so like I said there's the low water

1883
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:46,180
peak version this is the the kind it

1884
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:48,250
opens up more frequencies so you get

1885
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:51,160
this the spectrum over here in a band

1886
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:55,090
that you can use that you could use with

1887
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:56,559
CWDM channels there's a kind called

1888
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:58,480
dispersion shifted driver so what

1889
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,850
happened here was someone got the bright

1890
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:04,540
idea all right what if we design the

1891
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:07,420
fiber so that instead of the lowest

1892
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:09,640
dispersion being at 1310 what if we

1893
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:11,800
could shift that so that the lowest

1894
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:13,930
dispersion was over at 1550 that's the

1895
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:16,270
same point where the lowest attenuation

1896
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:19,270
is so now we're able to carry a signal

1897
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:21,580
and keep it bright and hopefully keep it

1898
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:24,010
you know have less dispersion so

1899
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:27,309
dispersion shifted fiber was that that

1900
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:29,410
first attempt and it works well on a

1901
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:31,270
single channel system so if all you ever

1902
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:35,530
want to do is put one carrier across the

1903
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:37,630
fiber great and then they create a DWDM

1904
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:40,870
and then they realized oh crap this is

1905
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:42,880
this is a real problem because what

1906
01:16:40,870 --> 01:16:45,910
happens when you do this with many

1907
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:49,090
different carriers is you create huge

1908
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:50,950
nonlinear interactions the reason for

1909
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:53,190
that is you actually want what's called

1910
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:56,349
walk-off you want dispersion helps

1911
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:59,259
dispersion spreads the signal so that in

1912
01:16:56,350 --> 01:17:01,660
any given molecule in any given instance

1913
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:03,640
the power is spread out across many of

1914
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:05,230
them and if there's less dispersion it's

1915
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:07,510
all passing through that one molecule

1916
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:10,330
right and then and that's causing your

1917
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:13,270
nonlinear effects so you rarely see this

1918
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:14,860
fiber deployed anymore it was just kind

1919
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:17,560
of ripped out and unused and because

1920
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:20,110
there's a commercial failure so then

1921
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:23,290
they said alright let's what if we did

1922
01:17:20,110 --> 01:17:26,019
it so that we didn't hit zero dispersion

1923
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:27,580
but we hit just outside so we should we

1924
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:29,530
shift the point of zero dispersion so

1925
01:17:27,580 --> 01:17:31,240
that it's just outside the frequencies

1926
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:33,490
that we want so we we have lower

1927
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:36,730
dispersion but it's still not completely

1928
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:38,620
gone it's it's still there so then you

1929
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:40,299
have to manage that you have you have

1930
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:42,460
two different kinds of fiber right so

1931
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:45,010
you have your your transmission fiber

1932
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:47,050
which causes dispersion in one way and

1933
01:17:45,010 --> 01:17:49,390
then you have your compensation fiber

1934
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:51,730
that that compresses the the signal

1935
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:53,409
optically and sends it back the other

1936
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:55,030
way and you switch back and for

1937
01:17:53,409 --> 01:17:57,219
between these two slopes and so at the

1938
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:59,139
end of it you come out with relatively

1939
01:17:57,219 --> 01:18:00,610
little dispersion compared to what it

1940
01:17:59,139 --> 01:18:02,560
would have been across this this very

1941
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:05,290
very long system and this is the way

1942
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,699
that we built long distance 10-gig

1943
01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:09,280
networks it was it was all kind of

1944
01:18:06,699 --> 01:18:10,989
predicated around this this kind of

1945
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:13,900
technology because you you have to

1946
01:18:10,989 --> 01:18:19,629
dispersion compensate in those types of

1947
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:22,059
systems another fiber g65 for is the

1948
01:18:19,630 --> 01:18:23,739
ultra low power high ultra low

1949
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:27,370
attenuation high power cable that you

1950
01:18:23,739 --> 01:18:30,099
see used in submarine systems and you'll

1951
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:31,659
see G 6 v 7 which is typically what your

1952
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:35,230
patch cables are made of this is called

1953
01:18:31,659 --> 01:18:37,388
Bend and sensitive fiber so you can go

1954
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:39,218
out and flex it or wrap it around your

1955
01:18:37,389 --> 01:18:42,100
finger or do whatever you want and it

1956
01:18:39,219 --> 01:18:44,170
won't cause attenuation like I said

1957
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:46,270
perfect patch cable use really really

1958
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:47,469
common for that but if you were running

1959
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:48,940
a thousand kilometers of it in the

1960
01:18:47,469 --> 01:18:50,139
ground you wouldn't if there's no point

1961
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:51,699
right you would you wouldn't want the

1962
01:18:50,139 --> 01:18:54,850
the cheapest best performance fiber

1963
01:18:51,699 --> 01:18:57,699
which is your 6 5 2 and modern fibers

1964
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:59,620
are better than these specs so the newer

1965
01:18:57,699 --> 01:19:01,059
the fiber generally the the better the

1966
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:05,230
better the quality the better the

1967
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:07,270
performance so here's an example of some

1968
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:10,000
of the different dispersion rates of the

1969
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:13,300
different commercial fiber types so you

1970
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:17,679
see the the value that is typically used

1971
01:19:13,300 --> 01:19:21,850
to describe chromatic dispersion of SM

1972
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:23,110
f28 standard G 6 v 2 is 17 picoseconds

1973
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:25,989
per nanometers so you see that's kind of

1974
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:27,940
right in the center of C band 17

1975
01:19:25,989 --> 01:19:29,650
picoseconds per nanometer per kilometer

1976
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:33,638
so if you want one kilometer you would

1977
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:35,080
have 17 if you went to double that but

1978
01:19:33,639 --> 01:19:36,489
you see there's there's a slope to that

1979
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,929
right so if you're on one into the C

1980
01:19:36,489 --> 01:19:41,349
band it's a lot lower if you're on the

1981
01:19:37,929 --> 01:19:44,650
other end at C band it's a lot higher so

1982
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:46,060
the the others slopes here there's

1983
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:47,920
different brands from different

1984
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:50,020
manufacturers there's leaf true wave

1985
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,550
tear light there's there's a lot of

1986
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:53,139
other brands out there and they each

1987
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:54,730
have their own slope and so when you

1988
01:19:53,139 --> 01:19:55,929
when you go to dispersion compensate you

1989
01:19:54,730 --> 01:19:57,009
have to slope match you have to make

1990
01:19:55,929 --> 01:20:01,780
sure that your dispersion compensation

1991
01:19:57,010 --> 01:20:03,280
is designed to counter the kind of fiber

1992
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:05,580
that's actually in the ground that

1993
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,580
you're using

1994
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:09,920
so nonlinear impairments I talked about

1995
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:11,630
this a little bit earlier but nonlinear

1996
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:13,970
impairments the the best way to describe

1997
01:20:11,630 --> 01:20:15,590
this is high power problems so if you

1998
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:18,530
don't transmit at high powers you will

1999
01:20:15,590 --> 01:20:20,720
never see these problems people ask well

2000
01:20:18,530 --> 01:20:21,800
how high is high and the answer is it

2001
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:24,760
depends

2002
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:28,940
generally speaking you start to see

2003
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:32,000
right around +4 DBM per carrier that's

2004
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:34,280
where your your into the nonlinear zones

2005
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,320
right so you if you keep your power less

2006
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:39,080
than that which if you if you just run

2007
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:40,940
even if you run an 80 kilometer DWDM

2008
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:43,220
system from your router you're probably

2009
01:20:40,940 --> 01:20:45,349
going to launch it like a zero or plus

2010
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:47,630
one you're unless you then immediately

2011
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:49,460
go into a booster you're never gonna see

2012
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:51,050
a nonlinear problem you only see this

2013
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:53,450
when you're really trying to get as much

2014
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:55,850
power as possible through the system so

2015
01:20:53,450 --> 01:20:59,030
nonlinear impairments there's there's

2016
01:20:55,850 --> 01:21:03,170
two different kinds right so one kind is

2017
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:05,630
stimulated scattering so this is SBS and

2018
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:08,180
SRS and the other kind is called the

2019
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:11,360
kerf act and that's what's happening

2020
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:13,430
when the light is actually causing the

2021
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:15,349
refractive index of the fiber to change

2022
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:17,090
in response to the amount of light

2023
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:19,070
that's in the system and that causes

2024
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:20,390
something's called four wave mixing self

2025
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:24,710
phase modulation and cross phase

2026
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:28,430
modulation so the the most basic simple

2027
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:31,550
one stimulated Bri wand scattering so

2028
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:34,550
basically this is when you put so much

2029
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:37,460
power into the fiber that it actually

2030
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:40,220
causes the the molecules of the glass to

2031
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:42,320
vibrate and an acoustic level and when

2032
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:44,230
it starts to vibrate it starts to set up

2033
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:46,940
these harmonics and it actually in

2034
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:49,429
vibrating at a certain way will cause

2035
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:51,349
the power eventually you stop being able

2036
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:53,120
to put power into the fiber and you

2037
01:21:51,350 --> 01:21:57,140
start getting power reflected back at

2038
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:58,610
you so eventually this can cause your

2039
01:21:57,140 --> 01:22:00,140
transmitter to be damaged this can

2040
01:21:58,610 --> 01:22:04,759
actually reflect power back at your

2041
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:06,410
transmitter and cause problems and this

2042
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:08,780
is very dependent on the power density

2043
01:22:06,410 --> 01:22:10,639
of the fiber so the the wider the line

2044
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:13,610
width the more you spread that optical

2045
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:15,260
power out over over wider frequencies

2046
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:16,490
the the more dispersion there is on the

2047
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:19,190
fiber of the more you spread that power

2048
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:20,840
out you can you can

2049
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:23,449
did their the signal to try and spread

2050
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:26,480
that out but coherent helps quite a bit

2051
01:22:23,449 --> 01:22:28,610
too so a modern coherent system does a

2052
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:31,190
very good job of spreading that signal

2053
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:33,410
out compared to a classic in rz9 I'll

2054
01:22:31,190 --> 01:22:36,980
talk more about that later the classic

2055
01:22:33,410 --> 01:22:39,139
10-gig type systems so SBS impact

2056
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:40,790
generally requires a long distance of

2057
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:42,620
fiber so if you run through of you know

2058
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:45,560
1 meter patch cable it might not be that

2059
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:47,150
big a deal but if you run through a 20

2060
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:50,330
kilometer span and you're really really

2061
01:22:47,150 --> 01:22:51,949
hot the further you go as you the more

2062
01:22:50,330 --> 01:22:53,510
molecules of glass you move through the

2063
01:22:51,949 --> 01:22:55,730
more you have opportunity for that power

2064
01:22:53,510 --> 01:23:00,050
to be reflected back because of those

2065
01:22:55,730 --> 01:23:02,718
vibrations SRS stimulated Raman

2066
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:06,199
scattering is how Raman amplification

2067
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:07,940
works so what's happening here is you're

2068
01:23:06,199 --> 01:23:10,070
transferring power from one wavelength

2069
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:11,150
to another and like I said when you when

2070
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:13,370
you do that intentionally when you

2071
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:15,139
transfer power from a pump laser that

2072
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:17,090
you don't care about in to a signal that

2073
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:19,370
you do care about its amplification and

2074
01:23:17,090 --> 01:23:20,930
it's good when this happens between two

2075
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:23,860
of your signals that you do care about

2076
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:26,870
and you don't want it to it's bad

2077
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:29,150
SRS the the tighter you pack the

2078
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:35,080
channels the more the more it affects

2079
01:23:29,150 --> 01:23:37,759
them so if you have a 80 channel system

2080
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:39,320
sorry the more channels you have the

2081
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,050
more it impacts it but the tighter you

2082
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:44,269
pack them the less it impacts it so you

2083
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:46,730
have this this big grid of different

2084
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:49,219
performance right if you have an 8

2085
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:52,218
channel system with 50 gigahertz spacing

2086
01:23:49,219 --> 01:23:55,040
you can go to extreme powers or you can

2087
01:23:52,219 --> 01:23:58,040
go to plus 21 per channel and still be

2088
01:23:55,040 --> 01:24:00,800
fine but if you run an 80 channel system

2089
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:02,510
you could only launch at plus 0 so if

2090
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,750
you were to try to come along and launch

2091
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:08,690
it that plus 3 or plus 4 plus 5 you'd be

2092
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:11,199
seeing significant impact nonlinear

2093
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:14,679
impact from this really strong signal

2094
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:17,629
because of the spacing of the channels

2095
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:20,480
for wave mixing is an interesting one so

2096
01:24:17,630 --> 01:24:22,969
this is what happens when the regularly

2097
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:25,639
spaced channels actually interfere with

2098
01:24:22,969 --> 01:24:29,510
each other and create harmonics so in

2099
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:32,780
this exam you see the the orange signal

2100
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:34,340
these are three regularly spaced say

2101
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:36,079
these are the carriers that you're

2102
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:38,630
actually trying to transmit data on and

2103
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:41,000
what's happening is because there's so

2104
01:24:38,630 --> 01:24:42,170
little dispersion on this fiber the the

2105
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,030
wavelengths are interacting with each

2106
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:47,210
other they're creating harmonics so you

2107
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:48,559
create harmonics to the side on unused

2108
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:50,300
bands well we don't care about that

2109
01:24:48,559 --> 01:24:52,489
because we're not actually using signal

2110
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:54,440
but we also create harmonics on the

2111
01:24:52,489 --> 01:24:57,949
three that we we care about right we've

2112
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:59,960
created a new signal that isn't our data

2113
01:24:57,949 --> 01:25:02,150
that just creates noise that's now

2114
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:04,940
really hard to decode because of the

2115
01:25:02,150 --> 01:25:06,769
interaction of these these three strings

2116
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:08,719
right next to each other and if you you

2117
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:10,460
put them so that they're not evenly

2118
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:12,079
spaced if you spread them apart if you

2119
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:15,039
do other things like that then you can

2120
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:19,190
work around the creation of that effect

2121
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:22,369
but here's here's why that dispersion

2122
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:24,888
the this is the what's called mixing

2123
01:25:22,369 --> 01:25:27,289
efficiency so this is how badly it mixes

2124
01:25:24,889 --> 01:25:30,050
there's three different slopes here

2125
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:32,300
right so the the lower one is regular sm

2126
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:35,139
f28 with your seventeen picosecond per

2127
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:38,090
nanometer per kilometer and so you see

2128
01:25:35,139 --> 01:25:39,940
channel spacing you've got this very

2129
01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:43,840
very inefficient like unless you are

2130
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:47,539
incredibly tight it doesn't want to mix

2131
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:50,000
if you go to no dispersion if you go all

2132
01:25:47,539 --> 01:25:53,090
the way to zero you see that it wants to

2133
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,559
mix instantly your ear this like

2134
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:58,969
remember this is a logarithmic scale so

2135
01:25:54,559 --> 01:26:01,400
when your neck 4950 that's not efficient

2136
01:25:58,969 --> 01:26:03,110
mixing at all when you're up here closer

2137
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:06,320
to zero that's incredibly efficient

2138
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:08,179
mixing so even even having one even one

2139
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:10,340
picosecond per nanometer of dispersion

2140
01:26:08,179 --> 01:26:12,679
is enough to create some amount of shift

2141
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:16,940
and that's what your your your

2142
01:26:12,679 --> 01:26:19,520
dispersion shifted fibers some more

2143
01:26:16,940 --> 01:26:20,989
diagrams are more examples of what

2144
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,610
different different channel counts at

2145
01:26:20,989 --> 01:26:26,388
different power levels people can look

2146
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:29,030
at so inter channel affects these are

2147
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:31,369
your Kerr effects so cross phase

2148
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:33,409
modulation is what happens when one

2149
01:26:31,369 --> 01:26:37,219
wavelength of light affects the phase of

2150
01:26:33,409 --> 01:26:39,348
another so generally the where you care

2151
01:26:37,219 --> 01:26:41,150
about this is when you're mixing and nrz

2152
01:26:39,349 --> 01:26:44,179
and a coherent system so if you have an

2153
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:45,990
old 10-gig system running what's called

2154
01:26:44,179 --> 01:26:49,230
an NRZ signal and non-return is

2155
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:50,730
and you put a new coherent hunter gig

2156
01:26:49,230 --> 01:26:53,639
signal on it and they're right next to

2157
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:55,410
each other the old nrz system will

2158
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:58,740
actually cause cross phase modulation

2159
01:26:55,410 --> 01:27:01,620
penalties on the coherent system and the

2160
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:03,330
easiest way to prevent this or makes

2161
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:05,670
this not cause impact is to have a

2162
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:07,559
separation have a guard band so if you

2163
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:09,360
keep 200 gigahertz of spacing between

2164
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:11,700
your nrz signals and your coherent

2165
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:14,969
signals you reduce the impact that you

2166
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:18,510
you see here self phase modulation is

2167
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:21,210
what happens when the the change between

2168
01:27:18,510 --> 01:27:23,760
a 1 or 0 you're making light really

2169
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:26,340
bright or really dim back and forth the

2170
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:28,140
the change between a 1 and a 0 can be so

2171
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:31,290
bright that it actually causes the

2172
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:33,600
perfect it actually causes the amount of

2173
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:37,980
power in the system changes the index of

2174
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:40,860
refraction of refraction and causes

2175
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:43,169
light to be steered so you can actually

2176
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:45,929
have have things where it actually

2177
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:47,820
causes the light to be constrained

2178
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:49,770
inside of the fiber much tighter than it

2179
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:51,480
wants to be there's all kinds of

2180
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:52,980
different weird effects that start to

2181
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:57,780
happen when you start to put really high

2182
01:27:52,980 --> 01:28:00,780
power systems out there but remember all

2183
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:02,580
of this is is tied to energy density

2184
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:05,090
it's about what happens when you put a

2185
01:28:02,580 --> 01:28:07,559
lot of power into this little tiny fiber

2186
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:10,050
so there's a concept in fiber called the

2187
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:12,990
effective area it's the the size of the

2188
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:18,350
glass that is actually carrying the the

2189
01:28:12,990 --> 01:28:20,760
wave so like I said chromatic dispersion

2190
01:28:18,350 --> 01:28:22,470
helps this because it's causing a

2191
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:24,720
walk-off it's actually causing the power

2192
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:26,040
to be carried at a different moment in

2193
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:28,980
time through a different different piece

2194
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:30,630
of glass if you have a large effective

2195
01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:33,839
area fiber if you have a wider core

2196
01:28:30,630 --> 01:28:35,430
fiber that works also the to a certain

2197
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:37,350
point right if you if you go too big

2198
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:39,300
then you cross into multimode and you're

2199
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:43,020
suddenly not doing anything useful long

2200
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:45,450
haul so this is this is called the

2201
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:47,220
fibers effective area and if you can't

2202
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:49,710
find the effective area you can go find

2203
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:52,410
the mode field diameter and do PI R

2204
01:28:49,710 --> 01:28:54,930
squared and this is telling you how

2205
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:58,650
large the core is how much of the core

2206
01:28:54,930 --> 01:29:00,929
there is to carry the fiber and so

2207
01:28:58,650 --> 01:29:03,719
submarine cable tends to be the largest

2208
01:29:00,929 --> 01:29:07,309
so a submarine cable like a corning bass

2209
01:29:03,719 --> 01:29:09,960
can be a hundred and fifty micron pour

2210
01:29:07,309 --> 01:29:11,760
the more the bigger the core the more

2211
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:14,039
power you put in so you're able to put

2212
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,630
in brighter signal you're able to carry

2213
01:29:14,039 --> 01:29:16,769
that further you you care about that

2214
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:19,409
when you're doing these these mini

2215
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:20,849
thousand kilometers submarine spans one

2216
01:29:19,409 --> 01:29:23,039
of the trade-offs with this is the

2217
01:29:20,849 --> 01:29:25,559
larger the effective area the less Raman

2218
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:29,400
gain you have because because Raman gain

2219
01:29:25,559 --> 01:29:30,630
is a kind of nonlinear effect so it

2220
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:33,289
tends to be it tends to be pretty

2221
01:29:30,630 --> 01:29:35,610
proportional all right so if you have a

2222
01:29:33,289 --> 01:29:37,679
smaller effective area fiber then your

2223
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:39,299
Raman works really well and you use

2224
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:41,460
Raman amplification and if you have this

2225
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:43,349
big fiber that's designed to take a lot

2226
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:45,090
of power then you don't need as much

2227
01:29:43,349 --> 01:29:46,739
Raman amplification and you just you get

2228
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:48,929
it back and you can you can put more

2229
01:29:46,739 --> 01:29:50,428
power into it in a straight fo so it

2230
01:29:48,929 --> 01:29:51,750
depends on the kind of fiber that you

2231
01:29:50,429 --> 01:29:53,159
want but you can you can go either

2232
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:56,820
direction and still get very similar

2233
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:58,138
outcomes so now I'm going to talk a

2234
01:29:56,820 --> 01:30:01,549
little bit about what we actually

2235
01:29:58,139 --> 01:30:04,289
transmit over the fiber itself so

2236
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:06,630
modulation remember at the end of the

2237
01:30:04,289 --> 01:30:08,340
day we live in an analog world right we

2238
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:11,820
think we're sending ones and zeros but

2239
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:13,530
we're not we're sending waves so we have

2240
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:15,420
to figure out how do we actually encode

2241
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:18,329
our digital signals in these analog

2242
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:20,039
waves and light is just another kind of

2243
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:23,610
electromagnetic wave just like

2244
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:25,500
everything else so the the simplest form

2245
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:27,360
of modulation the one that you'll see

2246
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:29,969
and the most basic kind of optics is

2247
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:31,949
something called I MD D and that stands

2248
01:30:29,969 --> 01:30:35,190
for intensity modulation with direct

2249
01:30:31,949 --> 01:30:36,780
detection the most specific the most

2250
01:30:35,190 --> 01:30:38,098
common form of that specifically is

2251
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:39,000
something called nrz which is

2252
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:41,070
non-return-to-zero

2253
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,480
you'll also hear this called amplitude

2254
01:30:41,070 --> 01:30:47,190
shift keying which is just like AM radio

2255
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:49,049
which is all just a really fancy way of

2256
01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:51,299
saying bright for a1 and dim for a0

2257
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:52,619
that's all this is and so a direct

2258
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:54,270
detect system means you have a

2259
01:30:52,619 --> 01:30:56,070
photodiode and it looks at this light

2260
01:30:54,270 --> 01:30:57,449
and it sees bright dim bright dim bright

2261
01:30:56,070 --> 01:31:00,420
dim and it turns it into ones and zeroes

2262
01:30:57,449 --> 01:31:02,369
so historically most of our fiber

2263
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:05,610
systems have been built purely around

2264
01:31:02,369 --> 01:31:07,650
nrz all of your tending signals and

2265
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:09,719
below are very much in this category

2266
01:31:07,650 --> 01:31:10,839
most of your client optics are in this

2267
01:31:09,719 --> 01:31:13,470
case

2268
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:16,420
and only the the newest highest-end

2269
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:20,500
long-haul or high capacity systems or

2270
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:22,900
something else so baaad is what happens

2271
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:24,520
when you when you have a single state so

2272
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:28,629
it's the rate at which you modulate a

2273
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:30,760
signal so if you send a 10 gigabit per

2274
01:31:28,630 --> 01:31:33,310
second signal that means you flash

2275
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:36,490
between a bright or dim 10 billion times

2276
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:38,950
a second that's 10 Giga baaad you carry

2277
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:42,219
one bit per baud and so there's your 10

2278
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:44,620
gigabit that's that's your data rate so

2279
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:48,160
this this worked really well up until

2280
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:50,200
about the 10 Giga baud range and as you

2281
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:52,510
start to go past 10 Giga mod then you

2282
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:56,440
start to it starts to get very very

2283
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:58,510
difficult to deal with dispersion said

2284
01:31:56,440 --> 01:32:01,299
the dispersion impacts you chromatic

2285
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:04,390
dispersion impacts you as the square so

2286
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:07,450
as the the Giga bond rate goes up harder

2287
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:10,180
and harder and harder so what happens

2288
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:12,070
when you you can't increase the Giga

2289
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:14,530
baud rate anymore what happens when you

2290
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:17,950
need to encode more data and you you

2291
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:20,469
don't know how well so there's a couple

2292
01:32:17,950 --> 01:32:23,019
things that you can do right one is you

2293
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:25,180
can add more states to the amplitude

2294
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:27,100
modulation so instead of having a bright

2295
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:29,170
and a dim you could have a bright and

2296
01:32:27,100 --> 01:32:31,570
are really bright so so two states you

2297
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:34,960
might have four states the other way is

2298
01:32:31,570 --> 01:32:37,179
something called phase shift key so

2299
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:39,010
that's a way to modulate data based on

2300
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:43,300
another property of an analog wave

2301
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:46,810
called the face so in phase shift keying

2302
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:48,940
what happens is you think think of a you

2303
01:32:46,810 --> 01:32:53,860
know a sine wave right here's here's a

2304
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:56,650
wave it's doing this if you want to

2305
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:58,719
modulate on phase what happens is you

2306
01:32:56,650 --> 01:33:01,509
have a sender and a receiver and they

2307
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:05,020
both agree on a specific frequency so

2308
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:08,410
they say we are going to use 196

2309
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:10,270
terahertz this is our frequency I am

2310
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:13,269
going to listen to it you're going to

2311
01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:15,310
send it and you actually have a laser on

2312
01:33:13,270 --> 01:33:17,350
the receive side so the just as the

2313
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:18,820
transmitter has a transmitting laser you

2314
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:21,100
have a laser on the receive side and you

2315
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:23,199
dial it to exactly the same thing that

2316
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:25,690
the transmitter is going to be sending

2317
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:28,570
so then you're able to modulate by

2318
01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:31,629
offsetting the phase instead of making

2319
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:33,880
it brighter or dimmer you you shift the

2320
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:35,290
point where where does it go to zero

2321
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:37,390
where does it where's the peak of the

2322
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:38,650
wave where's the the zero of the way

2323
01:33:37,390 --> 01:33:40,570
where is the low peak of the wave you

2324
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:44,650
move that back and forth that's the

2325
01:33:40,570 --> 01:33:47,440
phase and by comparing the local

2326
01:33:44,650 --> 01:33:50,650
oscillator what the the receiver has and

2327
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:52,150
what it knows is is that laser versus

2328
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:55,480
what the transmitter is sending you can

2329
01:33:52,150 --> 01:33:57,820
encode data that's phase shift key so

2330
01:33:55,480 --> 01:34:00,160
that introduces a class of optical

2331
01:33:57,820 --> 01:34:02,080
called coherent so this is where we

2332
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:05,889
started to introduce phase shift keying

2333
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:08,679
as a way to to encode this data and it's

2334
01:34:05,890 --> 01:34:10,540
named after the ability to track phase

2335
01:34:08,679 --> 01:34:12,870
changes in optical signals that's called

2336
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:15,730
phase coherence so coherent is kind of a

2337
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:19,390
marketing name for the general class of

2338
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:21,099
technology and it provides a new way to

2339
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:23,739
modulate signal so it's not just bright

2340
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:25,750
dim bright dim so like I said there's a

2341
01:34:23,739 --> 01:34:27,968
local oscillator there's a laser on the

2342
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:29,920
receive side that you dial to exactly

2343
01:34:27,969 --> 01:34:32,770
what you want and you compare the

2344
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:35,050
difference you modulate on phase and you

2345
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:37,929
you're able to encode data in a

2346
01:34:35,050 --> 01:34:40,510
completely different way but that's not

2347
01:34:37,929 --> 01:34:42,730
as easy as it sounds like that's way

2348
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:44,980
more complex than a simple photodiode or

2349
01:34:42,730 --> 01:34:46,449
you just look at a light and see bright

2350
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:49,449
dim bright dim and turn it into ones and

2351
01:34:46,449 --> 01:34:51,549
zeros so to decode this you need what's

2352
01:34:49,449 --> 01:34:55,690
called a DSP a digital signal processor

2353
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:58,449
and this is a highly advanced chip that

2354
01:34:55,690 --> 01:35:00,339
is purpose-built to decode these analog

2355
01:34:58,449 --> 01:35:02,559
signals and figure out what you were

2356
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:04,600
what you were trying to encode so it

2357
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:07,210
starts to have they complexity not not

2358
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:09,850
quite of like a modern CPU but it sits

2359
01:35:07,210 --> 01:35:13,989
up there it's a very very advanced very

2360
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:16,540
purpose-built specific processor for

2361
01:35:13,989 --> 01:35:18,129
decoding these signals and there's many

2362
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:20,500
different manufacturers of these and

2363
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:22,270
they they treat them as closely guarded

2364
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:24,219
secrets with lots of research that goes

2365
01:35:22,270 --> 01:35:27,940
into the technology that's behind these

2366
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:29,489
and these DSPs are what's able to decode

2367
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:32,889
this signal and tie it all back together

2368
01:35:29,489 --> 01:35:35,799
so when we introduce coherent we had an

2369
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:36,969
immediate overnight jump we went from we

2370
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:39,219
were doing 106

2371
01:35:36,969 --> 01:35:43,750
channels of 10-gig and hitting all of

2372
01:35:39,219 --> 01:35:46,090
these these nrz limitations - we moved

2373
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:48,219
immediately to 96 channels of a hundred

2374
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:51,790
gigs so we jumped overnight from 1.6

2375
01:35:48,219 --> 01:35:54,250
terabit than 9.6 terabit it gave us our

2376
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:57,130
first true hundred gig optical signals

2377
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:59,500
so instead of just in by 10 we had real

2378
01:35:57,130 --> 01:36:00,670
native hundred gig and then it went up

2379
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:03,730
from there

2380
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:06,489
coherent also greatly eliminates the

2381
01:36:03,730 --> 01:36:09,339
need for dispersion compensation so the

2382
01:36:06,489 --> 01:36:11,879
DSPs actually like dispersion the it

2383
01:36:09,340 --> 01:36:14,170
helps them calculate the signal better

2384
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:15,640
it's better to have dispersion than to

2385
01:36:14,170 --> 01:36:18,040
have no dispersion and they can eat

2386
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:19,660
tremendous amounts of it so it you're no

2387
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:22,239
longer having to do all this dispersion

2388
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:25,809
compensation every every hop and it

2389
01:36:22,239 --> 01:36:26,709
greatly enhanced our bandwidth so where

2390
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:29,620
do you go from there

2391
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:32,530
well now that we're we're modulating on

2392
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:33,849
phase you add amplitude back into it so

2393
01:36:32,530 --> 01:36:35,800
you have something called qualm

2394
01:36:33,850 --> 01:36:38,290
quadrature amplitude modulation so it's

2395
01:36:35,800 --> 01:36:40,449
basically just a combination of phase

2396
01:36:38,290 --> 01:36:43,900
shift keying and amplitude modulation so

2397
01:36:40,449 --> 01:36:45,280
now you have two different modulated

2398
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:47,080
carriers that you can send at the same

2399
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:50,530
time the same frequency but with a phase

2400
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:52,239
offset and you're using a DSP to

2401
01:36:50,530 --> 01:36:53,769
computationally recover from that and so

2402
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:56,468
you get more and more and more complex

2403
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:58,630
you create more potential states where

2404
01:36:56,469 --> 01:37:00,790
you can encode data so we have eight

2405
01:36:58,630 --> 01:37:03,880
qualm 16 column 32 column 64 column you

2406
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:06,030
you move up the the scale and different

2407
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:08,560
potential states and now we even have

2408
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:10,929
irregular constellations we have we have

2409
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,820
these half qualms dates where some of

2410
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:13,989
the time we're using we're using more

2411
01:37:12,820 --> 01:37:16,929
states and some of the time we're using

2412
01:37:13,989 --> 01:37:19,929
less there's a lot of fancy technology

2413
01:37:16,930 --> 01:37:23,199
that's out there to encode more bits per

2414
01:37:19,930 --> 01:37:27,420
symbol rate so you get 4 5 6 bits per

2415
01:37:23,199 --> 01:37:30,910
per change of baud per per symbol

2416
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:33,340
we also use polarization multiplexing so

2417
01:37:30,910 --> 01:37:34,660
remember that light among the many

2418
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:36,969
things that we don't really understand

2419
01:37:34,660 --> 01:37:39,309
about it is is just a wave it's a wave

2420
01:37:36,969 --> 01:37:40,960
propagating through space and because we

2421
01:37:39,310 --> 01:37:44,410
live in a three-dimensional space we

2422
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:48,760
have an X and a y-axis and light can you

2423
01:37:44,410 --> 01:37:50,290
can send a a horizontal wave propagating

2424
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:52,390
like this and you can send

2425
01:37:50,290 --> 01:37:54,370
vertical propagating wave like this and

2426
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:57,340
as long as they're they're completely

2427
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:58,809
horizontal clearly orthogonal to each

2428
01:37:57,340 --> 01:38:01,300
other they will propagate without

2429
01:37:58,810 --> 01:38:03,220
interference so you can basically double

2430
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:05,800
the amount of capacity that you can send

2431
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:07,660
through a three-dimensional fiber by

2432
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:10,960
sending these two polarizations of light

2433
01:38:07,660 --> 01:38:13,720
and the DSPs decode all of this in the

2434
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:15,630
end and computationally recover what it

2435
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:20,530
was you were trying to put in there so

2436
01:38:15,630 --> 01:38:23,320
what you end up with is you look at the

2437
01:38:20,530 --> 01:38:25,590
bit rate being a multiplication of your

2438
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:27,790
polarizations or a number of carriers

2439
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:32,080
times your baud rate times your

2440
01:38:27,790 --> 01:38:34,900
modulation so today we only have dual

2441
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:36,340
polarization there's other there's other

2442
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:39,280
things that we're trying to figure out

2443
01:38:36,340 --> 01:38:40,750
how to do this on like angular orbital

2444
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:43,660
angular momentum and things like that

2445
01:38:40,750 --> 01:38:49,990
but today we just have polarization so

2446
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:52,180
we get two carriers we have baud rate so

2447
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:54,550
the the baud rate the higher the baud

2448
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:55,780
rate the wider the channel size you need

2449
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:57,780
because I said the baud rate is directly

2450
01:38:55,780 --> 01:39:00,280
proportional to the width of the laser

2451
01:38:57,780 --> 01:39:02,080
so you need these better better quality

2452
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:04,090
Dax but we get better and better and

2453
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:05,170
better at designing better Dax that are

2454
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:09,490
able to work with these higher baud

2455
01:39:05,170 --> 01:39:11,290
rates and modulation is how we encode

2456
01:39:09,490 --> 01:39:14,650
the data so the higher the higher the

2457
01:39:11,290 --> 01:39:16,510
modulation you go the higher and OSN are

2458
01:39:14,650 --> 01:39:18,400
you need so you end up with this big

2459
01:39:16,510 --> 01:39:21,790
table or you end up with these many many

2460
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:23,910
many different ways to achieve so let's

2461
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:26,260
say for example you wanted to achieve a

2462
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:30,309
100 gig data rate well what that might

2463
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:35,500
look like is a 32 gigabits signal with

2464
01:39:30,310 --> 01:39:39,100
two polarities encoded at QPSK so DP do

2465
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:41,380
a polarity QPSK so that's that's just

2466
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:43,330
straight phase shift key so that that

2467
01:39:41,380 --> 01:39:45,940
signal ends up fitting inside of a 37

2468
01:39:43,330 --> 01:39:47,320
point 5 gigahertz channel and by the

2469
01:39:45,940 --> 01:39:50,559
time you had effect overhead it needs

2470
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:53,200
128 gigs of data to carry your hundred

2471
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:55,240
gigs and it lets you work at these very

2472
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:57,550
low SNR so you could get down to like an

2473
01:39:55,240 --> 01:39:59,080
O SNR of 10 DB which is extremely low

2474
01:39:57,550 --> 01:40:00,670
and those are the those are the kind of

2475
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:02,260
signals that you can carry tens of

2476
01:40:00,670 --> 01:40:02,989
thousands of kilometers across all the

2477
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:05,270
way around the world

2478
01:40:02,989 --> 01:40:07,519
and still be fine but if you want to

2479
01:40:05,270 --> 01:40:10,070
carry a modern higher in signal say you

2480
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:12,170
want to carry a 600 gig wave you would

2481
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:14,750
do that with you know potentially 64

2482
01:40:12,170 --> 01:40:17,060
Giga bought signal done at 64 quam and

2483
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:19,700
it needs this wider channel and it needs

2484
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:21,350
a much higher OS NR but you you get to

2485
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:24,110
pick and choose you get to decide which

2486
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:26,510
which you know given the properties of

2487
01:40:24,110 --> 01:40:29,780
your line system which level of signal

2488
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:32,270
you want to carry so here's an example

2489
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:34,489
of a modern DSP and what that looks like

2490
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:35,900
so acacia is one of the leading

2491
01:40:34,489 --> 01:40:38,989
manufacturers they're kind of like the

2492
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:41,660
Broadcom of the optical DSP world most

2493
01:40:38,989 --> 01:40:43,669
people use them so this is the latest

2494
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:45,380
product that they ship and here's all

2495
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:46,989
the different combinations here's all

2496
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:50,210
the different ways that you can achieve

2497
01:40:46,989 --> 01:40:52,040
different bit rates so if you want a 200

2498
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:54,590
gig signal you might do it at 34

2499
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:56,210
gigabytes 16 qualm you might do it at 46

2500
01:40:54,590 --> 01:40:59,680
gigabyte in a qualm you might do it at

2501
01:40:56,210 --> 01:41:04,130
QPSK at 69 Giga mod and each one has a

2502
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:05,930
performance trade-off so here's what I

2503
01:41:04,130 --> 01:41:07,940
mean by that well let's consider two

2504
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:11,180
different ways that you could get to 200

2505
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:14,599
gig right so one was we do it with two

2506
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:19,100
polarities 32gb baaad and 16 qualms so

2507
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:22,130
that requires a 19.5 dbo SNR which is

2508
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:23,930
healthy but it fits into a very small

2509
01:41:22,130 --> 01:41:26,420
channel it fits into a 37 point 5

2510
01:41:23,930 --> 01:41:27,590
gigahertz channel another way that you

2511
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:30,680
could get 200 gig

2512
01:41:27,590 --> 01:41:34,130
instead of instead of trying to to up

2513
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:36,830
your modulation is up your baud rate so

2514
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:40,550
instead do 64 Giga baaad but do it at

2515
01:41:36,830 --> 01:41:43,550
QPSK same data rate same 200 gig but now

2516
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:46,250
we can go way down to a 14.5 DB OS star

2517
01:41:43,550 --> 01:41:48,140
so the the benefit there we can carry

2518
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:50,510
that potentially thousands of kilometers

2519
01:41:48,140 --> 01:41:53,140
longer but what we've traded is we now

2520
01:41:50,510 --> 01:41:55,610
need a wider channel to do so so

2521
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:57,500
remember as the baud rate increases that

2522
01:41:55,610 --> 01:42:00,589
the channel sizes is increases

2523
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:03,620
proportionally so the more spectrum you

2524
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:05,630
can allocate to a particular carrier the

2525
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:08,719
more efficient you can be with it the

2526
01:42:05,630 --> 01:42:10,010
more you're able to to do this the

2527
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:11,570
downside there is if you're running a

2528
01:42:10,010 --> 01:42:13,489
brownfield network so I'll say you've

2529
01:42:11,570 --> 01:42:15,259
got a whole bunch of deployed rotom's

2530
01:42:13,489 --> 01:42:16,349
out there and they only passed 50

2531
01:42:15,260 --> 01:42:18,690
gigahertz

2532
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:21,480
so a 50 gigahertz Rotom might only have

2533
01:42:18,690 --> 01:42:24,509
a 37 point 5 gigahertz passband you're

2534
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:26,190
only able to do the 32 gigabyte signal

2535
01:42:24,510 --> 01:42:29,940
you're not able to do a 64 gigabyte

2536
01:42:26,190 --> 01:42:31,530
signal so the wider your channels are or

2537
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:32,969
the more modern your system is and the

2538
01:42:31,530 --> 01:42:35,519
more that it's able to work with with

2539
01:42:32,970 --> 01:42:39,930
Flex grid the more efficient you're able

2540
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:41,910
to get with your your carriers so some

2541
01:42:39,930 --> 01:42:44,580
more more things about coherent like I

2542
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:47,849
said it eats dispersion compensation for

2543
01:42:44,580 --> 01:42:49,400
lunch so you can easily do hundreds of

2544
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:52,020
thousands of picoseconds per nanometer

2545
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:55,139
and in fact coherent systems work better

2546
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:56,340
with the dispersion coherent can lock on

2547
01:42:55,140 --> 01:42:58,020
because because there's a local

2548
01:42:56,340 --> 01:43:01,380
oscillator because you're doing phase

2549
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:03,120
shifting you're able to lock on to a

2550
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:05,940
specific frequency so in a lot of cases

2551
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:08,690
you don't need a MUX that's how a CDC

2552
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:11,400
Rotom works you're not actually

2553
01:43:08,690 --> 01:43:13,320
filtering out what channel 1 went here

2554
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:15,929
in channel 2 and here you're sending

2555
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:17,969
both signals to both ports and you're

2556
01:43:15,930 --> 01:43:20,690
letting the receiver lock on to only

2557
01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:23,100
what it cares about and discard the rest

2558
01:43:20,690 --> 01:43:24,690
but there's a lot of downsides right

2559
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:27,210
these are these are very expensive

2560
01:43:24,690 --> 01:43:28,980
power-hungry components they're

2561
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:31,680
extremely difficult to integrate into

2562
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:34,740
pluggable x' so pretty much a rule of

2563
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:36,510
thumb is whatever we consider the

2564
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:40,769
pluggable that we use for our high

2565
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:43,650
density you know 100 gig client optics

2566
01:43:40,770 --> 01:43:45,690
is always going to be too small for

2567
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:47,790
whatever the latest greatest generation

2568
01:43:45,690 --> 01:43:49,620
of DSP czar that can live outside and a

2569
01:43:47,790 --> 01:43:53,250
completely different thermal thermal

2570
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:54,630
envelope and as those as as we increase

2571
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:57,120
those plug holes and as those pluggable

2572
01:43:54,630 --> 01:43:59,580
change the DSP technology changes to and

2573
01:43:57,120 --> 01:44:02,340
it parallels each other quite well so

2574
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:04,230
it's very very difficult to get coherent

2575
01:44:02,340 --> 01:44:06,990
shoved all the way down into a pluggable

2576
01:44:04,230 --> 01:44:08,129
and by the time we we do we'll probably

2577
01:44:06,990 --> 01:44:09,840
have decided we don't like that

2578
01:44:08,130 --> 01:44:14,640
pluggable format anymore and wanted the

2579
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:16,230
switch so the other way that you could

2580
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:18,360
you could do this remember what I said

2581
01:44:16,230 --> 01:44:23,549
you can you can have multiple states you

2582
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:25,740
can also have so energy is what's called

2583
01:44:23,550 --> 01:44:28,290
Pam to pulse amplitude modulation with

2584
01:44:25,740 --> 01:44:29,909
two states so bright dim another way to

2585
01:44:28,290 --> 01:44:32,489
increase capacity

2586
01:44:29,909 --> 01:44:35,159
is to add more states so there's a

2587
01:44:32,489 --> 01:44:36,900
technique called pam-4 so now we have a

2588
01:44:35,159 --> 01:44:39,388
bright and really bright ademma nor

2589
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:41,429
really dim seer you're able to encode

2590
01:44:39,389 --> 01:44:43,920
for potential States all right so you

2591
01:44:41,429 --> 01:44:45,630
end up with this this thing that looks

2592
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:47,250
like this so as you as you move from one

2593
01:44:45,630 --> 01:44:50,520
state to another you're able to encode

2594
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:55,560
whether it was a 1 1 or 1 0 things like

2595
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:58,909
that so a lot of there's a lot of work

2596
01:44:55,560 --> 01:45:01,530
that goes into on this specifically a

2597
01:44:58,909 --> 01:45:02,969
lot of the 400 gig client optics that

2598
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:05,670
we're using are all gonna be based

2599
01:45:02,969 --> 01:45:11,030
around pam-4 technology because it's

2600
01:45:05,670 --> 01:45:13,530
very very difficult to do 100 gig nrz

2601
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:15,360
single lambda and so like if you

2602
01:45:13,530 --> 01:45:18,509
consider that the cheapest hundred gig

2603
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:21,540
is 4 by 25 how do you do 4 by 100 that's

2604
01:45:18,510 --> 01:45:25,199
still 100 you you need a 100 native

2605
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:29,909
optical carrier a lot of the 400 gig

2606
01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:33,178
things are built around doing 50 50 Giga

2607
01:45:29,909 --> 01:45:35,489
baud pam-4 and multiple channels of that

2608
01:45:33,179 --> 01:45:37,860
so pam-4 is is very much tied to

2609
01:45:35,489 --> 01:45:41,040
everything that we're doing in 400 get

2610
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:46,170
clients and it's it's used in things

2611
01:45:41,040 --> 01:45:48,030
like DWDM tune q SP 28 done in pam form

2612
01:45:46,170 --> 01:45:51,780
that you can you can carry over over

2613
01:45:48,030 --> 01:45:54,480
distance there's a new technology that

2614
01:45:51,780 --> 01:45:57,570
people are very excited about called for

2615
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:59,879
hundred gigs er so this is an attempt to

2616
01:45:57,570 --> 01:46:03,449
get coherent technology down into a

2617
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:05,670
pluggable so I have to tell you right

2618
01:46:03,449 --> 01:46:08,699
now this is still very much in the R&D

2619
01:46:05,670 --> 01:46:10,800
phase none of this exists outside of the

2620
01:46:08,699 --> 01:46:14,250
lab the standards are still being

2621
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:17,070
developed it's still a work in progress

2622
01:46:14,250 --> 01:46:19,320
so why would we want to do this well

2623
01:46:17,070 --> 01:46:21,330
there's a lot of overhead you can

2624
01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:23,040
potentially take out if you can

2625
01:46:21,330 --> 01:46:26,400
eliminate external transponders so

2626
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:29,489
consider if if all you're doing with

2627
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:31,920
your optical network is lighting you you

2628
01:46:29,489 --> 01:46:34,709
run this this big optical network and

2629
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:38,070
you create packets and and then you go

2630
01:46:34,710 --> 01:46:40,710
right into a router you you light the

2631
01:46:38,070 --> 01:46:42,659
optical network with your router if you

2632
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:43,590
aren't selling an optical wavelength if

2633
01:46:42,659 --> 01:46:45,330
you aren't doing

2634
01:46:43,590 --> 01:46:47,100
if all you're doing is lighting your

2635
01:46:45,330 --> 01:46:48,780
packet Network you could have been a lot

2636
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:50,910
more efficient if you had put that

2637
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:54,389
directly in the router if you could

2638
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:56,309
bypass those those client optics you're

2639
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:58,050
saving yourself potentially some sr4

2640
01:46:56,310 --> 01:47:00,000
optics there's no law for optics and

2641
01:46:58,050 --> 01:47:02,310
some patch cables you're simplifying

2642
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:06,090
your management you now don't have a

2643
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:08,430
second external transponder to manage so

2644
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:10,620
the the way that this is is talked about

2645
01:47:08,430 --> 01:47:13,830
is what's called IP over DWDM it's it's

2646
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:15,120
just straight putting the DWDM directly

2647
01:47:13,830 --> 01:47:16,680
into the router and this is something

2648
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:18,599
that the industry's going back and forth

2649
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:21,210
on for many many years

2650
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:23,120
some some days it's the latest fad some

2651
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:26,630
days if people are moving away from it

2652
01:47:23,120 --> 01:47:29,610
Madhvi edges and disadvantages to each

2653
01:47:26,630 --> 01:47:34,560
so potentially you can eliminate all of

2654
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:36,299
that router vendors have been doing have

2655
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:38,130
been building coherent line cards

2656
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:41,220
recently so they've been taking what

2657
01:47:38,130 --> 01:47:42,510
would have been a DSP an external DSP

2658
01:47:41,220 --> 01:47:44,130
and just putting it on the line card so

2659
01:47:42,510 --> 01:47:46,830
it's still functionally the same thing

2660
01:47:44,130 --> 01:47:49,050
but it's it's now on the router instead

2661
01:47:46,830 --> 01:47:51,870
of requiring external transponder the

2662
01:47:49,050 --> 01:47:54,330
problem with this is the the rate of

2663
01:47:51,870 --> 01:47:57,180
evolution the rate at which the DSP

2664
01:47:54,330 --> 01:48:02,160
strange is a bit different than the rate

2665
01:47:57,180 --> 01:48:03,750
at which the switch boards change so

2666
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:06,450
largely what you end up doing is

2667
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:08,250
creating a crippled line card that now

2668
01:48:06,450 --> 01:48:10,110
has a lot less capacity for a lot more

2669
01:48:08,250 --> 01:48:12,540
money when you would have been a lot

2670
01:48:10,110 --> 01:48:15,420
better off just running an SR 4 optic

2671
01:48:12,540 --> 01:48:18,210
and a patch cable so four hundred gigs

2672
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:20,100
ER is an attempt to actually do this and

2673
01:48:18,210 --> 01:48:25,620
get it down into a pluggable so it'll be

2674
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:27,690
a a 400 gig so think a QSP 56 DD that'll

2675
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:32,130
actually be able to do coherent 80

2676
01:48:27,690 --> 01:48:35,490
kilometer DWDM into a pluggable it's

2677
01:48:32,130 --> 01:48:37,410
very very complex it's so very difficult

2678
01:48:35,490 --> 01:48:40,340
engineering challenge where we're a long

2679
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:43,349
ways away from that being being ready

2680
01:48:40,340 --> 01:48:47,370
and like I said there's a pam-4 DWDM

2681
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:50,100
also so you'll you'll see commercial

2682
01:48:47,370 --> 01:48:52,890
systems like in five makes the the most

2683
01:48:50,100 --> 01:48:55,969
prevalent one of these systems where you

2684
01:48:52,890 --> 01:48:59,929
you take 256 gigabyte

2685
01:48:55,969 --> 01:49:03,170
56 gig systems so it's 28 gigabyte at

2686
01:48:59,929 --> 01:49:06,110
pam-4 two carriers offset at plus and

2687
01:49:03,170 --> 01:49:08,599
minus 25 gigahertz so you're you're able

2688
01:49:06,110 --> 01:49:11,360
to pack a hundred gig deed of EDM

2689
01:49:08,599 --> 01:49:13,699
channel into a q SP 28 put it directly

2690
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:16,039
into your device and you can do 80 to

2691
01:49:13,699 --> 01:49:18,289
120 kilometres but there's a lot of

2692
01:49:16,039 --> 01:49:20,420
caveats attached to this so you need

2693
01:49:18,289 --> 01:49:22,670
special flattop muxes so if you have

2694
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:25,070
standard off-the-shelf muxes that you've

2695
01:49:22,670 --> 01:49:26,329
always worked with that have always been

2696
01:49:25,070 --> 01:49:28,369
fine till now well they're not going to

2697
01:49:26,329 --> 01:49:30,920
work anymore they're not going to carry

2698
01:49:28,369 --> 01:49:32,719
the the spectral width that you need for

2699
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:34,699
this particular signal they're also not

2700
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:37,519
going to work for your your 600 gig

2701
01:49:34,699 --> 01:49:38,928
coherent systems either so a lot of

2702
01:49:37,519 --> 01:49:42,019
folks are gonna need to go out and

2703
01:49:38,929 --> 01:49:44,809
upgrade with pam-4 specifically you've

2704
01:49:42,019 --> 01:49:46,579
very very tight dispersion compensation

2705
01:49:44,809 --> 01:49:48,739
tolerances so you have to get to within

2706
01:49:46,579 --> 01:49:51,849
plus or minus 100 picoseconds per

2707
01:49:48,739 --> 01:49:54,678
nanometer which is very very very tight

2708
01:49:51,849 --> 01:49:57,380
you have to amplify straight out of the

2709
01:49:54,679 --> 01:49:58,699
card so you you can't even take one

2710
01:49:57,380 --> 01:50:00,050
optic and link it directly to another

2711
01:49:58,699 --> 01:50:02,299
optic sitting right next to each other

2712
01:50:00,050 --> 01:50:05,269
you have to have an amplification pass

2713
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:06,860
just to be ever be able to link once and

2714
01:50:05,269 --> 01:50:09,710
by the way for hundred gigs ER is gonna

2715
01:50:06,860 --> 01:50:12,259
be the exact same way so it's it's not

2716
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:15,769
going to be this this panacea of oh it's

2717
01:50:12,260 --> 01:50:17,570
just like old tunable DWDM where i

2718
01:50:15,769 --> 01:50:19,670
plugged it in at work that I didn't need

2719
01:50:17,570 --> 01:50:21,739
amplification or know anything optically

2720
01:50:19,670 --> 01:50:23,659
you you actually will need to run

2721
01:50:21,739 --> 01:50:26,329
realign systems and amplification no

2722
01:50:23,659 --> 01:50:28,009
matter what you do and and these things

2723
01:50:26,329 --> 01:50:29,749
have a very high OS in our requirements

2724
01:50:28,010 --> 01:50:32,869
so basically you you're never able to

2725
01:50:29,749 --> 01:50:36,228
pass pam-4 system through a Rotom the

2726
01:50:32,869 --> 01:50:39,589
the impact from all the amplification is

2727
01:50:36,229 --> 01:50:42,349
way too much so now I'm going to talk a

2728
01:50:39,590 --> 01:50:47,030
little bit about engineering that you

2729
01:50:42,349 --> 01:50:48,860
can do so insertion loss even best

2730
01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:50,360
connectors and splices aren't perfect so

2731
01:50:48,860 --> 01:50:52,219
every time you connect two fibers

2732
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:53,119
together in any way shape or form you're

2733
01:50:52,219 --> 01:50:55,699
going to get loss

2734
01:50:53,119 --> 01:50:58,598
so a typical budgetary figure will be

2735
01:50:55,699 --> 01:51:00,888
0.5 DB per connector but the actual

2736
01:50:58,599 --> 01:51:03,650
number will vary depending on the

2737
01:51:00,889 --> 01:51:06,979
conditions how clean the fiber is what

2738
01:51:03,650 --> 01:51:09,290
the mating type connector is insertion

2739
01:51:06,979 --> 01:51:11,360
loss is also used to describe loss

2740
01:51:09,290 --> 01:51:14,480
from amok so it's just the penalty you

2741
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:15,920
pay from plugging in the fiber so you

2742
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:20,089
know you might plug into a 40-channel

2743
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:22,730
DWDM system and you might have a 3.5 DB

2744
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:24,590
loss just from going into that MUX you

2745
01:51:22,730 --> 01:51:29,450
might plug into an ad channel system and

2746
01:51:24,590 --> 01:51:31,280
you might see a 9.5 db2 Miz really just

2747
01:51:29,450 --> 01:51:32,780
240 channel systems glued together with

2748
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:35,090
an inner leader that's why that

2749
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:37,309
insertion loss is so high and that's why

2750
01:51:35,090 --> 01:51:40,850
you you typically see these systems only

2751
01:51:37,310 --> 01:51:43,660
used on high-end amplified systems where

2752
01:51:40,850 --> 01:51:45,770
you you can overcome that kind of loss

2753
01:51:43,660 --> 01:51:47,480
when you when you play an optical

2754
01:51:45,770 --> 01:51:49,490
network you need a budget someone in

2755
01:51:47,480 --> 01:51:50,269
optics says ten kilometres that's the

2756
01:51:49,490 --> 01:51:54,019
loosest

2757
01:51:50,270 --> 01:51:55,580
of guidelines I've seen optics that say

2758
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:58,160
ten kilometres that I can take 30

2759
01:51:55,580 --> 01:51:59,960
kilometres I've seen optics that say one

2760
01:51:58,160 --> 01:52:04,220
kilometer that I can take 25 kilometres

2761
01:51:59,960 --> 01:52:06,710
it absolutely positively is just a bare

2762
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:08,750
guideline so you need to actually look

2763
01:52:06,710 --> 01:52:10,880
at the light levels and what impairments

2764
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:13,730
you're going to hit as you go across the

2765
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:15,320
signal but you want to leave some margin

2766
01:52:13,730 --> 01:52:17,570
you want to leave some room so that as

2767
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:19,250
the as the transmitters might cool with

2768
01:52:17,570 --> 01:52:20,660
age so five years from now you don't

2769
01:52:19,250 --> 01:52:22,430
find that you've crossed this magic

2770
01:52:20,660 --> 01:52:24,410
threshold and that your signal goes down

2771
01:52:22,430 --> 01:52:26,000
and remember you have to leave room like

2772
01:52:24,410 --> 01:52:27,710
what happens if there's a fiber cut and

2773
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,880
the spy screw goes out and they fix it

2774
01:52:27,710 --> 01:52:31,100
but they don't fix it quite perfectly

2775
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:33,110
and there's a little bit more loss or

2776
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:34,400
just technicians going on the field and

2777
01:52:33,110 --> 01:52:37,179
bending the fiber cables you have to

2778
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:39,860
leave a little bit of a margin in there

2779
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:41,420
there's a I talked about this a little

2780
01:52:39,860 --> 01:52:43,610
bit earlier but different connector

2781
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:47,750
types so primarily you'll see these

2782
01:52:43,610 --> 01:52:49,219
called PC or UPC which people think they

2783
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:50,960
stand for polish connector they actually

2784
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:55,100
don't they stand for physical contact

2785
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:59,810
so your blue fiber ends are your your PC

2786
01:52:55,100 --> 01:53:01,610
or UPC your green fiber connectors are

2787
01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:03,350
your angled physical contacts you see

2788
01:53:01,610 --> 01:53:05,599
they have a they have a cut that's a

2789
01:53:03,350 --> 01:53:08,690
slight angle it's an 8 degree angle the

2790
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:10,610
reason for this has 100 percent to do

2791
01:53:08,690 --> 01:53:12,980
with reflections it doesn't make the

2792
01:53:10,610 --> 01:53:16,429
signal carry anybody any better in any

2793
01:53:12,980 --> 01:53:19,849
way other than reflections in a regular

2794
01:53:16,430 --> 01:53:21,620
UPC system when you unplug that fiber

2795
01:53:19,850 --> 01:53:23,780
cable and there's nothing plugged into

2796
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:26,210
the end of it it now starts to try

2797
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:28,400
a lot of that light back so if you have

2798
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:30,110
a very high power system you can

2799
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:31,670
transmit more power back and you can

2800
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:34,339
actually cause damage and do things that

2801
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:35,210
you don't want to do and an APC system

2802
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:37,250
because you have this little eight

2803
01:53:35,210 --> 01:53:38,990
degree cut when you unplug that fiber

2804
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:40,430
cable it's now transmitting the power

2805
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:43,460
into nothing it's going into the

2806
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:45,560
cladding and dissipating so you you see

2807
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:47,600
this used whenever you have a high power

2808
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:53,030
system of some form that's the only time

2809
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:54,230
that it matters when you amplify so when

2810
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:55,849
you when you work with a signal you have

2811
01:53:54,230 --> 01:53:58,160
to do what's called the three RS one

2812
01:53:55,850 --> 01:54:00,290
hour two hour and three hours so 1r is

2813
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:01,490
amplification so when you go through an

2814
01:54:00,290 --> 01:54:03,620
Ed fund you make it brighter you've

2815
01:54:01,490 --> 01:54:05,030
you've just amplified it you haven't

2816
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:08,540
reshaped even looked at the signal in

2817
01:54:05,030 --> 01:54:11,300
any way you can do reshaping you can

2818
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:13,190
restore the ones in the zeros but you

2819
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:16,190
don't always have to go all the way to

2820
01:54:13,190 --> 01:54:18,799
retiming so retiming is a full o yo

2821
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:20,540
you've completely decoded the signal you

2822
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:22,520
know exactly what it was originally and

2823
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:24,230
now you re encode it going forward so

2824
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:28,970
that's typically what happens in a full

2825
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:32,299
transponder bit error rates as you as

2826
01:54:28,970 --> 01:54:33,620
you start to cause impairments typically

2827
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:35,510
links don't just go out and die you

2828
01:54:33,620 --> 01:54:36,830
don't just cross this magic line where

2829
01:54:35,510 --> 01:54:39,680
all of a sudden it's either working or

2830
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:41,210
not working what tends to happen is as

2831
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:43,610
it gets worse and worse and worse the

2832
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:46,400
the bit error rate goes up the potential

2833
01:54:43,610 --> 01:54:49,250
that there's an error goes up so when

2834
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:51,440
you talk about testing span you talk

2835
01:54:49,250 --> 01:54:53,570
about testing a link you have to put a

2836
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:55,730
certain amount of data across it to have

2837
01:54:53,570 --> 01:54:58,700
a certain level of confidence that a

2838
01:54:55,730 --> 01:55:02,990
link will work so for example if you

2839
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:05,510
want to be 99% confident that a hundred

2840
01:55:02,990 --> 01:55:07,219
gig link has a ten to the thirteen bit

2841
01:55:05,510 --> 01:55:09,140
error rate you have to generate a

2842
01:55:07,220 --> 01:55:11,420
hundred gig traffic for three point

2843
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:13,700
three four three hours and 30 min twenty

2844
01:55:11,420 --> 01:55:15,530
nine minutes right after you've done

2845
01:55:13,700 --> 01:55:17,300
three hours and 29 minutes of traffic

2846
01:55:15,530 --> 01:55:19,429
and you've seen no loss then you have a

2847
01:55:17,300 --> 01:55:22,160
99% confidence this is the bit error

2848
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:24,710
rate that's why when you when you turn

2849
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:26,090
up telco circuits if you ever see people

2850
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:27,530
come out and leave test sets running for

2851
01:55:26,090 --> 01:55:29,420
a really really long time that's what

2852
01:55:27,530 --> 01:55:31,309
they're trying to certify is this is the

2853
01:55:29,420 --> 01:55:33,050
the certain bit error rate and the lower

2854
01:55:31,310 --> 01:55:35,739
the speed the link the longer you have

2855
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:38,940
to leave that test running

2856
01:55:35,739 --> 01:55:42,610
I'm gonna skip some stuff for time so

2857
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:44,679
optical power meters light meters tools

2858
01:55:42,610 --> 01:55:46,960
of the trade simplest thing on the

2859
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:48,430
planet you go out there and plug your

2860
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:50,770
fiber into it look at it and it tells

2861
01:55:48,430 --> 01:55:53,170
you how bright the signal is and it's

2862
01:55:50,770 --> 01:55:58,000
going to display the values as either

2863
01:55:53,170 --> 01:55:59,830
DBMS or milliwatts if you have a light

2864
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,780
meter and it has a relative lost mode if

2865
01:55:59,830 --> 01:56:03,489
it has a button that says DB that is

2866
01:56:01,780 --> 01:56:05,559
meant to be used as part of fiber

2867
01:56:03,489 --> 01:56:07,120
testing so that's meant to be used with

2868
01:56:05,560 --> 01:56:09,130
a known light source on the other side

2869
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:11,019
so that you can compare how much loss do

2870
01:56:09,130 --> 01:56:13,030
you have and say hey this cable has this

2871
01:56:11,020 --> 01:56:14,770
much loss but when you're actually

2872
01:56:13,030 --> 01:56:16,780
plugging into a router and wanting to

2873
01:56:14,770 --> 01:56:19,030
see how much light am i putting out you

2874
01:56:16,780 --> 01:56:22,210
need to be in DBM mode you need to be in

2875
01:56:19,030 --> 01:56:23,769
the absolute mode so remember find a

2876
01:56:22,210 --> 01:56:25,120
nickel for every time someone told me

2877
01:56:23,770 --> 01:56:26,730
they should measured plus 70 on my fiber

2878
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:29,640
I'd be a rich man

2879
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:31,809
OT DRS an optical time-domain

2880
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:34,150
reflectometer so this is a tool that

2881
01:56:31,810 --> 01:56:36,100
helps you characterize fiber what it

2882
01:56:34,150 --> 01:56:38,110
does is it sends pulses of light out

2883
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:40,719
into the glass and it looks at the

2884
01:56:38,110 --> 01:56:42,250
reflections and by by sending these

2885
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:44,230
really bright pulses of light and

2886
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:46,239
waiting and seeing exactly how they come

2887
01:56:44,230 --> 01:56:48,309
back and varying them over time you can

2888
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:51,160
measure you can find the splice points

2889
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:53,410
you can see what's the rate of loss over

2890
01:56:51,160 --> 01:56:55,000
over distance where the splice points

2891
01:56:53,410 --> 01:56:57,849
are there any potential issues or their

2892
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:59,530
core mismatches it helps you

2893
01:56:57,850 --> 01:57:01,110
characterize the fiber so you you

2894
01:56:59,530 --> 01:57:03,400
typically use that when you're

2895
01:57:01,110 --> 01:57:04,960
provisioning a new fiber or

2896
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:06,489
troubleshooting it in some way trying to

2897
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:09,250
figure out where the cut is it'll tell

2898
01:57:06,489 --> 01:57:12,370
you 27 kilometers down the span is is

2899
01:57:09,250 --> 01:57:15,180
where the issue is here's an example of

2900
01:57:12,370 --> 01:57:15,180
what that output looks like

2901
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:20,380
people ask me question can I really

2902
01:57:18,580 --> 01:57:22,630
blind myself by looking into the end of

2903
01:57:20,380 --> 01:57:24,250
the fiber otherwise known as beware of

2904
01:57:22,630 --> 01:57:28,930
big scary lasers do not look in the beam

2905
01:57:24,250 --> 01:57:31,270
with remaining.i I put these stickers

2906
01:57:28,930 --> 01:57:34,750
out and patch panels randomly sometimes

2907
01:57:31,270 --> 01:57:37,150
just to mess with people it's funny so

2908
01:57:34,750 --> 01:57:40,000
laser safety lasers are grouped into

2909
01:57:37,150 --> 01:57:42,429
four main classes for safety so class 1

2910
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:45,370
is completely harmless in normal use

2911
01:57:42,430 --> 01:57:46,780
it's either so low powered that it's it

2912
01:57:45,370 --> 01:57:48,660
could do nothing to you or it's

2913
01:57:46,780 --> 01:57:51,570
completely inaccessible during normal

2914
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:52,769
operations and a class 1m is harmless as

2915
01:57:51,570 --> 01:57:56,040
long as you don't look at it in a

2916
01:57:52,770 --> 01:57:57,780
microscope class 2 is harmful only if

2917
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:59,880
you intentionally stare at it so like

2918
01:57:57,780 --> 01:58:01,290
your supermarket scanners if you really

2919
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:03,240
wanted to you can hold your eye open and

2920
01:58:01,290 --> 01:58:06,870
do this but if you don't want to blind

2921
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:08,790
yourself don't do that class 3 is is

2922
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:11,700
something that can be harmful if you

2923
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:13,290
look at it accidentally so there's

2924
01:58:11,700 --> 01:58:14,849
there's two different ways that that

2925
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:16,950
split there's an old system and a new

2926
01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:19,200
system it used to be called 3r and 3b

2927
01:58:16,950 --> 01:58:22,110
now it's called or used to be called 3a

2928
01:58:19,200 --> 01:58:25,080
and 3b now it's called 3r and 3b and

2929
01:58:22,110 --> 01:58:26,969
that has to do with different

2930
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:28,290
frequencies of light and different power

2931
01:58:26,970 --> 01:58:30,990
levels will be given different

2932
01:58:28,290 --> 01:58:34,140
classifications depending on how likely

2933
01:58:30,990 --> 01:58:36,330
it is to cause harm so like those super

2934
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:38,010
high powered laser pointers you people

2935
01:58:36,330 --> 01:58:39,330
buy on the internet I call them the

2936
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:43,050
Department of Homeland Security bat

2937
01:58:39,330 --> 01:58:45,330
signals those those a lot of times or

2938
01:58:43,050 --> 01:58:47,640
into the the three B's or even class 4

2939
01:58:45,330 --> 01:58:49,260
and class 4 is is something that burns

2940
01:58:47,640 --> 01:58:51,570
melts or destroys all around

2941
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:53,100
it's the industrial lasers that are that

2942
01:58:51,570 --> 01:58:56,370
are very very powerful that would

2943
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:59,070
actually cause like thermal damage so

2944
01:58:56,370 --> 01:59:00,599
when you look at lasers from a

2945
01:58:59,070 --> 01:59:02,370
networking perspective it's it's

2946
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:04,050
classified these are these are all

2947
01:59:02,370 --> 01:59:07,530
infrared these are all infrared lights

2948
01:59:04,050 --> 01:59:10,170
so infrared can be broken down into two

2949
01:59:07,530 --> 01:59:12,389
classes so it's called IRA and IRB so

2950
01:59:10,170 --> 01:59:14,970
IRA is near-infrared it's it's very

2951
01:59:12,390 --> 01:59:19,020
close to the the frequencies of light

2952
01:59:14,970 --> 01:59:21,150
that we see and IRB is far and for a

2953
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:23,250
shortwave infrared and that's that's so

2954
01:59:21,150 --> 01:59:25,980
far away that that we can't see it so

2955
01:59:23,250 --> 01:59:29,610
laser safety is actually based on what

2956
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:31,559
can enter the eye not just the absolute

2957
01:59:29,610 --> 01:59:33,690
power levels so the cornea actually does

2958
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:36,180
a really good job of filtering out light

2959
01:59:33,690 --> 01:59:37,620
that the eye if you can't see it what's

2960
01:59:36,180 --> 01:59:40,200
the value in it coming through your

2961
01:59:37,620 --> 01:59:41,970
cornea so IR be though the far infrared

2962
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:44,099
actually does a really good job of

2963
01:59:41,970 --> 01:59:46,350
getting filtered by your eye it's the

2964
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:48,390
light that's that's much closer the the

2965
01:59:46,350 --> 01:59:49,860
lower frequencies that are closer to the

2966
01:59:48,390 --> 01:59:52,620
visible light that we normally look at

2967
01:59:49,860 --> 01:59:54,719
that get through so these are the the

2968
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:57,690
power requirements for the different

2969
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:59,790
look these are the continuous no auto

2970
01:59:57,690 --> 02:00:02,370
shutoff power requirements for different

2971
01:59:59,790 --> 02:00:08,100
class lasers so if you wanted

2972
02:00:02,370 --> 02:00:10,110
send an IRB signal over 27 DBM you'd be

2973
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:13,080
into a class 4 laser territory you need

2974
02:00:10,110 --> 02:00:15,360
these active disconnect features all

2975
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:18,570
kinds of laser safety things because you

2976
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:20,610
could potentially hurt yourself so as

2977
02:00:18,570 --> 02:00:22,410
far as this goes in the field routers

2978
02:00:20,610 --> 02:00:23,880
essentially there's nothing that you

2979
02:00:22,410 --> 02:00:27,420
will find on a router that is anything

2980
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:29,850
other than a class 1 laser they even

2981
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:30,870
your your long reach 80 kilometer 200

2982
02:00:29,850 --> 02:00:32,850
kilometer doesn't matter

2983
02:00:30,870 --> 02:00:34,440
what's happening is you're not making

2984
02:00:32,850 --> 02:00:36,300
the laser is transmitting any stronger

2985
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:39,030
you're making the receiver more

2986
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:41,820
sensitive so the laser power is is

2987
02:00:39,030 --> 02:00:43,019
pretty well fixed the only time you

2988
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:45,920
really get into something that's

2989
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:49,830
potentially harmful is when you have

2990
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:53,370
amplifiers so you you know move into 3 R

2991
02:00:49,830 --> 02:00:54,690
or 3b systems if you have Raman

2992
02:00:53,370 --> 02:00:57,180
amplification that's pretty much always

2993
02:00:54,690 --> 02:00:59,940
a class for ramen ramen amps are very

2994
02:00:57,180 --> 02:01:01,200
very high-end and they use typically

2995
02:00:59,940 --> 02:01:06,089
have some kind of an auto power

2996
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:09,420
reduction or shut off or break I'm gonna

2997
02:01:06,090 --> 02:01:11,070
have to time well whatever if you have a

2998
02:01:09,420 --> 02:01:12,540
lot of DJ vdm equipment if you have like

2999
02:01:11,070 --> 02:01:13,830
40 channels that are all mixed into one

3000
02:01:12,540 --> 02:01:15,300
well you know you've just made the chant

3001
02:01:13,830 --> 02:01:16,769
the signal 40 times brighter so

3002
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:18,570
potentially you could take something

3003
02:01:16,770 --> 02:01:21,540
that was completely harmless but now you

3004
02:01:18,570 --> 02:01:23,219
have 40 of them you could you could look

3005
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:24,780
at it and hurt yourself so should I be

3006
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:27,780
wearing safety safety goggles in the

3007
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:29,610
Colo generally speaking no your your

3008
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:31,290
client optics like I said or all class

3009
02:01:29,610 --> 02:01:34,110
one almost everything that you'll touch

3010
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:36,030
on the routers class one even your

3011
02:01:34,110 --> 02:01:37,440
amplified DWM systems unless you're

3012
02:01:36,030 --> 02:01:39,780
looking at it with a fiber microscope

3013
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:44,820
you're probably fine like light it tends

3014
02:01:39,780 --> 02:01:47,340
to spread out pretty quickly so why even

3015
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:49,200
look at the fiber anyways you're you're

3016
02:01:47,340 --> 02:01:50,670
actually you're not actually able to see

3017
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:52,679
infrared on any signal but you're able

3018
02:01:50,670 --> 02:01:54,270
to see the sidebands so if you look at

3019
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:55,890
like an 850 signal you'll see a little

3020
02:01:54,270 --> 02:02:00,360
bit of red but you're just seeing the

3021
02:01:55,890 --> 02:02:04,440
imperfections of the signal I'm gonna

3022
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:05,519
skip a bunch of stuff for time do I

3023
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:08,460
should need to be concerned about Bend

3024
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:10,050
radius yes it's a real issue you can

3025
02:02:08,460 --> 02:02:11,730
actually cause light to leak out the

3026
02:02:10,050 --> 02:02:14,280
side so here's an example of what

3027
02:02:11,730 --> 02:02:16,650
happens when you take a bright

3028
02:02:14,280 --> 02:02:18,179
led and Bend the fiber past it's been

3029
02:02:16,650 --> 02:02:21,330
radius and it literally causes it to

3030
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:22,800
leak out the sides of the fiber so you

3031
02:02:21,330 --> 02:02:24,600
really want to use Bend insensitive

3032
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:25,950
fiber if possible and working of data

3033
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:30,750
center so that you don't accidentally

3034
02:02:25,950 --> 02:02:31,950
cause issues different wavelengths to

3035
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:33,750
talk to each other I've said all this

3036
02:02:31,950 --> 02:02:36,380
before do I really need to clean the

3037
02:02:33,750 --> 02:02:39,330
fiber yes you do

3038
02:02:36,380 --> 02:02:41,100
yes so but a lot of people don't

3039
02:02:39,330 --> 02:02:43,740
understand you you've got a meeting for

3040
02:02:41,100 --> 02:02:46,680
self 2.2 pounds over a 200 micron

3041
02:02:43,740 --> 02:02:48,120
surface area that's 45,000 pounds per

3042
02:02:46,680 --> 02:02:50,730
square inch of pressure coming together

3043
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:52,260
in these very very small surfaces so if

3044
02:02:50,730 --> 02:02:54,480
you have a piece of dust in there it can

3045
02:02:52,260 --> 02:02:57,570
permanently pit the fiber you can it can

3046
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:59,250
ruin that fiber in ways that that you

3047
02:02:57,570 --> 02:03:00,870
might not know until you're way way way

3048
02:02:59,250 --> 02:03:02,880
further down the road and causing

3049
02:03:00,870 --> 02:03:04,230
problems so when in doubt buy a really

3050
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:06,840
cheap cleaning kit they're all over the

3051
02:03:04,230 --> 02:03:08,969
place other miscellaneous fiber

3052
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:12,000
information if you've ever wondered how

3053
02:03:08,970 --> 02:03:15,360
fast light travels through fiber speed

3054
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:17,490
of light is here SM f28 has a refractive

3055
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:19,170
index of one point four six seven nine

3056
02:03:17,490 --> 02:03:21,210
so that means light travels through

3057
02:03:19,170 --> 02:03:22,140
fiber at two hundred and four thousand

3058
02:03:21,210 --> 02:03:26,510
bah-bah-bah

3059
02:03:22,140 --> 02:03:29,280
so if you turn that into time for every

3060
02:03:26,510 --> 02:03:31,500
one millisecond for every for every

3061
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:34,769
hundred kilometer of fiber or sixty two

3062
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:37,350
point five miles of fiber roundtrip you

3063
02:03:34,770 --> 02:03:39,540
see one millisecond of latency added to

3064
02:03:37,350 --> 02:03:41,340
your fiber so if you ever wonder why you

3065
02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:41,550
see much higher values than that in real

3066
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:43,500
life

3067
02:03:41,550 --> 02:03:45,990
remember the fibers rarely lay in a

3068
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:48,030
straight line it's usually in rings

3069
02:03:45,990 --> 02:03:49,530
going through structured cabling all

3070
02:03:48,030 --> 02:03:52,590
over the place there might be dispersion

3071
02:03:49,530 --> 02:03:54,840
compensation spools but that's how fiber

3072
02:03:52,590 --> 02:03:58,470
actually creates latency actually

3073
02:03:54,840 --> 02:03:59,910
affects latency and and causes causes

3074
02:03:58,470 --> 02:04:04,630
that as you go thousands of kilometers

3075
02:03:59,910 --> 02:04:10,430
and show that's pretty much it questions

3076
02:04:04,630 --> 02:04:10,430
[Applause]

3077
02:04:15,489 --> 02:04:26,559
questions nope and in that case enjoy

3078
02:04:24,050 --> 02:04:26,560
your finger

3079
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:36,160
you
