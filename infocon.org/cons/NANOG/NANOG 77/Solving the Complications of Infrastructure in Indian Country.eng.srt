1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,590
so I my mic is hot yay

2
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,390
so that was Indian country not the

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:24,619
country of India in case people were

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:27,650
wondering the you know difference so I I

5
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:30,859
come to you from Arcadian and for calm

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,390
and I've been with the Southern

7
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:36,250
California tribal Chairman's association

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:40,850
in San Diego for the last 18 years

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:42,409
building microwave network and I want to

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:45,710
share a little bit of experience about

11
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:48,019
what it's like to work with Native

12
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:50,600
American tribes and some of the

13
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:51,979
complications of networking in Indian

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,030
country and why people don't have access

15
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:57,830
and how to solve that so I leave this up

16
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,159
here so you could read it I not gonna

17
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:04,339
read my slides but you know there's some

18
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:06,048
very interesting components that are in

19
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:08,240
the United States and I spoke in DC and

20
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:11,900
I talked about some of the issues where

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,509
we have we did a study and we found that

22
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:18,500
there's 8,000 missing middle mile fiber

23
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:20,630
miles to connect the reservations to the

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:24,679
rest of the backbone so those of you

25
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:27,170
that build backbone have you know gone

26
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:29,990
by Indian reservations but there are no

27
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,520
options for for connectivity with the

28
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,039
long haul and then the middle mile

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,859
providers have gone to you know where

30
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:39,649
the ROI is but they don't see our ROI in

31
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:42,288
the in the native lands so those don't

32
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:44,869
come on so we did a study and we mapped

33
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:47,630
out 8,000 missing middle mile miles in

34
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:52,460
the lower 48 alone so there's a little

35
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:54,199
bit of complication there so I'm gonna

36
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,729
focus a little bit on California because

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,119
it's where I have a lot of my experience

38
00:01:55,729 --> 00:02:01,369
there's 109 tribes in California 573 in

39
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,749
the rest of the US and the tribal

40
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:05,499
digital village network that I was

41
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:09,919
working on supports these tribes and

42
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:11,510
there are a cluster of 17 inhabited

43
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,950
tribes in San Diego County and then just

44
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,410
across the border in Riverside County

45
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,988
there's a about seven more and so we

46
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:21,720
worked with most of them and I wanted to

47
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:24,240
just paint the picture of

48
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,609
and without one go there we go of what's

49
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,710
missing in the u.s. he showed this last

50
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,210
time and those of you are here these are

51
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:34,020
them these are the holes in the general

52
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,550
fibre map of the United States oddly

53
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,410
enough that's mostly where the

54
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,710
reservations are is where you don't see

55
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:43,340
black line for fibre so with Arcadian we

56
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,810
built across or we're building across

57
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,360
Phoenix to Salt Lake Phoenix to Denver

58
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,890
and we've announced Los Angeles to

59
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,840
Dallas that goes through the lands where

60
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,790
there is no connectivity for middle mile

61
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,470
will be working with tribes along that

62
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,560
route we have a deal with the Navajo

63
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,900
reservation but everywhere there's these

64
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:06,180
little holes missing in the bottom left

65
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:08,070
here we're in Southern California in San

66
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,480
Diego County which everybody assumes

67
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,620
it's fairly populated where if we have a

68
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,540
hole and that's where all the tribes are

69
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:20,850
so this is the tribal disbursement in

70
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:22,109
San Diego and obviously we're not on the

71
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,150
beach the beaches to the left

72
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,940
Mexico's to the south the Riverside

73
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,790
County to the north so you get into

74
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,560
complication working with tribes because

75
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:33,750
we've been put at the base of the

76
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,320
mountains or in the the valleys that

77
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,459
they assumed were not livable we've been

78
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,010
pushed away from the general population

79
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,550
within pushed away from features like

80
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:47,850
the ocean features like rivers to be

81
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:49,860
kept out of sight so we try to take

82
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,290
advantage of those situations we've been

83
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:57,840
put in you know you get lemons you make

84
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:59,790
lemonade and we have mountains so we'd

85
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,900
have things that look like this so what

86
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:04,200
do you do with mountains what do you do

87
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,450
with tribal geography it looks pretty

88
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,410
hard to build fiber especially

89
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:13,049
underground but microwave starts to look

90
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,310
really really optimal so if you take a

91
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,100
look at a neighborhood that's in the

92
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:20,130
base of this canyon surrounded by

93
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,260
mountains this is a typical situation in

94
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:27,600
California and the middle mile fiber

95
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,770
does not travel down that road not until

96
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,919
the tribal digital village network

97
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,740
started anyway and this connectivity to

98
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,909
this community was just non-existent

99
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,460
carriers weren't

100
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,500
you know cable was Metro only and so

101
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,270
these these locations with you know

102
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,830
thousands of people living in these

103
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,349
locations didn't have access to Internet

104
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,359
so they don't have access to any of the

105
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,920
things that your networks helped deploy

106
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,740
they don't have access to your tools

107
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,830
your apps your trainings your

108
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,090
opportunities there's another I have a

109
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,280
bunch of pictures in here just to give

110
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,830
you example but it looks like a suburban

111
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,000
neighborhood overlaid on a nice rural

112
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,469
landscape some of them are pretty deep

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,110
canyons you can't even see the houses in

114
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:17,520
this one there's about eleven so we do

115
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:20,430
things like build wireless short

116
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,260
microwave hops long microwave Hobbs

117
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,160
most of the stuff runs on solar power

118
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:28,020
and you know we try to harness the

119
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,580
opportunities that were given so we're

120
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,940
on a mountaintop we can see everything

121
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,950
we have line of sight we are in Southern

122
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,660
California we have a lot of Sun so we

123
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:40,620
put out solar panels and we and we power

124
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,990
our systems with solar panels and we

125
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:45,570
happen to have a lot of really amazing

126
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,910
open land with opportunity like this and

127
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:51,480
a people that are very interested in

128
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:54,330
getting connected so we've gone through

129
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,970
and worked with each of the tribes and

130
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,070
built these relay stations that are

131
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,560
running on solar power to be able to

132
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,820
bring internet to these communities

133
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,520
bring all of the services that you guys

134
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:12,750
provide with your networks and this is

135
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,460
this is all possible only because at one

136
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,760
point along the way we were able to

137
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,590
navigate access to backhaul in the very

138
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,750
beginning when I started in 2001 with

139
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,369
these guys living with the community

140
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,430
working in the community owned and

141
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,750
operated by the community we were

142
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,940
fighting the ax fiber and we didn't have

143
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,970
access to fiber because ATT wouldn't

144
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:36,510
sell it to us so we got a ds3 we had

145
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:38,640
copper and copper was $99 a Meg per

146
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:41,099
month so figure out scale and network

147
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,570
with that money and and so we were

148
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,390
trying to connect our people and figure

149
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:47,700
out this on copper things evolved fiber

150
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,620
got put in the valley we got access to

151
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,150
that

152
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,129
we worked with the state we worked with

153
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,419
some of you in the room we worked with

154
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:56,749
different players to try to help

155
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:58,159
leverage opportunities and bring in and

156
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,599
bring in opportunities for the tribes

157
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:01,669
then we got access to fiber for the

158
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,620
first time so then we could actually

159
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:06,289
look at a scalable model we were still

160
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:09,830
at $16 a Meg per month which is still a

161
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:13,639
tough scale but we had capacity so we

162
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:15,050
were figuring out how to do this I like

163
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,240
this one because it shows snow in San

164
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,860
Diego people are like what but yeah it

165
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,870
snows we have 6,000 foot elevation

166
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,849
mountains sometimes and so we get access

167
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:24,439
to snow as well I'm actually looking for

168
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:27,878
you snowmobile for those of you they

169
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:29,930
live where it snows you know hook me up

170
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,360
we have a lot of weather stations we

171
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:35,900
have a lot of you know some agriculture

172
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,610
we have we have you know some EPA stuff

173
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,239
where we're checking water systems and

174
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,319
and running different tests on

175
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,779
reservations and getting it back to

176
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,699
towers and using Internet of Things to

177
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:49,129
try to work on stuff and in rural

178
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:52,689
communities like this and so we really

179
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:57,110
need the access to this moving forward

180
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:58,099
and as communities grow this I think

181
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,250
we're looking down at the rink on

182
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:03,259
community and so there is now a

183
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,969
transient population that comes in

184
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:07,039
because there's a big casino economic

185
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:08,449
development project and we have between

186
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,068
a few of our casinos we have the

187
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:12,889
population of Disneyland every day

188
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:14,389
coming through this valley and and so

189
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:17,719
these networks become really important

190
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:19,699
and really key to connecting Indian

191
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:21,409
country and making sure that the safety

192
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,360
mechanisms are there that you have in

193
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:24,800
the urban environments and the rural

194
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,330
environments and when you're out in our

195
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,680
communities we want you to be just as

196
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,800
safe as you were when you're in your

197
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,630
suburb fancy little happy home we want

198
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,630
to have those same options there so

199
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,740
we're working with the network builders

200
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,719
and working with the different

201
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,769
opportunities at the at the federal

202
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,949
government to be able to bring these

203
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,690
opportunities to tribes but you know

204
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:47,569
it's a long battle so as you build out

205
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:50,089
your infrastructure as you think about

206
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:52,459
who your end user is and how you are

207
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:54,170
going to work with society and a

208
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:55,910
cross-section of society don't forget

209
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,769
that there's tribes out there that are

210
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,810
very eager to work with your products

211
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:00,310
and be involved with your products but

212
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,579
don't have

213
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,329
access usually to your products so

214
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,680
because they don't have access to

215
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:10,570
network so as some of your relationships

216
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,250
with other companies come along and and

217
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,050
they build opportunity and you have

218
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,839
philanthropic efforts I want you to

219
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,810
think about tribes and where at some

220
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,300
juncture you could support an

221
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,430
opportunity to connect tribes at the

222
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:28,569
moment there is a frequency that is

223
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:32,229
available come January 1 of 2020 it's

224
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:34,450
called EBS it's 2.5 gigahertz it is an

225
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:38,560
educational broadcast spectrum that is

226
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:41,020
not being it's really not being used

227
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,339
properly let's say it's a lot of it's

228
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,410
leased to one of the carriers or

229
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:46,870
assigned to one of the carriers and

230
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,459
they're they're taking it back and

231
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,910
they're gonna auction it off and the

232
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,860
tribes have fought to put this into a

233
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:56,500
tribal priority so that tribes have

234
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:59,680
access to yet another piece of the

235
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,990
puzzle to deploy these types of networks

236
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,050
it requires public comment it requires

237
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:08,800
chiming in from carriers from from

238
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:11,290
providers from content providers such as

239
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,839
some of you in the room and and that

240
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,599
public comment would support the tribes

241
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,589
having access to this spectrum because

242
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,330
you know that we're deploying with

243
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:23,410
unlicensed spectrum on a regular basis

244
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:26,080
and I guess one of the asks that I will

245
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,240
leave with you you know as we go through

246
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,980
this talk is is the fact that when you

247
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,330
see opportunities come up and they're

248
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,610
talking about spectrum and they're

249
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,890
talking about options there is a tribal

250
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,150
priority that we push at the Federal

251
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,439
Communications Commission through the

252
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,689
National Congress of American Indians

253
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,660
and we're out there talking to them

254
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:45,280
about opportunity bring this to the

255
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,510
tribes that tribes have a first shake at

256
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,550
it because we're you know we're a

257
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:51,600
minuscule part of the landscape of the

258
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:55,420
United States in the current status and

259
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,930
if we had option of that spectrum and

260
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,069
those opportunities over tribal land

261
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,839
it's not really going to change the

262
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,390
landscape for the carrier or the big

263
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,209
industry in the in the grand scheme of

264
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:09,760
things so if you have the ability to

265
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:11,369
publicly comment and support these kinds

266
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,529
of efforts we'd love it

267
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:17,100
if you were looking out for the

268
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:18,660
under-connected in the united states so

269
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,660
we've gotten fairly technologically

270
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:24,260
advanced you know several reservations

271
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,089
have technical universities Navajo has -

272
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,580
you know we have a lot of training we

273
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:32,160
train a lot of our our community members

274
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:35,070
to teach them how to to build solutions

275
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,390
like this you've learned a lot over the

276
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:42,150
years to be able to provide our own

277
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:44,490
connectivity and we have turned into not

278
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,900
I wouldn't say solar experts but we know

279
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,510
a lot more about solar than we ever

280
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,010
thought we were going to it looks more

281
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:54,120
like a solar farm than it does a tower

282
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:56,850
so you know these are these are some of

283
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,600
the things that that bring solutions to

284
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:03,180
rural America oddly enough next to our

285
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,820
reservations are rural homes that have

286
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,829
the same lack of connectivity so as we

287
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,720
grow opportunity in our community and as

288
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,210
we get access to fiber backhaul in these

289
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,100
communities we're now getting access to

290
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:16,920
be able to provide to our non-tribal

291
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:21,990
neighbors as well so we're solving the

292
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:23,400
middle America problem so connecting San

293
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,040
Diego's reservation looks about like

294
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:29,520
this takes about two hours to drive from

295
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,319
the top left to the bottom right and the

296
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,180
only place that there's fiber available

297
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,740
in this network is at the top left and

298
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,500
the bottom right which i think is maybe

299
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,610
on my next lane or it's down the way

300
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:44,310
I'll show you

301
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:46,380
so we've resorted to microwave and as I

302
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:48,719
am in the middle of a transition in my

303
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:53,189
career from building from the ground up

304
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,320
to building from the top down the top

305
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:59,839
down solution with arcadian and 4.com is

306
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:02,880
building large capacity long haul fiber

307
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,250
that goes from you know data center to

308
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,209
data center for a specific customer or

309
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:11,250
set of customers but dragging that line

310
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:14,099
through middle america dragging that

311
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,690
line through tribal america and leaving

312
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,640
opportunity at that doorstep and

313
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,290
partnering with folks that will build

314
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,640
out or partnering with the tribe if they

315
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,500
already have the wherewithal to put

316
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,220
together

317
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:28,010
an opportunity for themselves so here's

318
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,360
another bunch of information a little

319
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,840
bit more technical which some of you

320
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,390
like so we use every ounce of unlicensed

321
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,130
spectrum that's available we even use

322
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:40,699
licensed spectrum did you point to point

323
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:43,580
locations because they're not auctioned

324
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:46,760
off and it frees up the use of some of

325
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,800
the unlicensed that you see in the list

326
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,910
here

327
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,189
we're construct the constantly

328
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:56,990
leveraging opportunity with Federal

329
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:59,450
Communications Commission with with

330
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:02,680
folks like Microsoft working on the TV

331
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:05,000
white space band we're working with a

332
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,729
group of people to try to get the

333
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,840
licensing for EBS spectrum the CB RS

334
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,530
spectrum

335
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:17,930
a35 is coming up for change soon and

336
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:21,350
we're working on that as well so to get

337
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:23,329
these people eyes your customers there's

338
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,830
a big bunch of steps that I have to

339
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,470
happen to get them online to be able to

340
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,940
serve the community so that they can

341
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,600
participate in what the rest of the

342
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,800
world is doing

343
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:36,260
we are eager and active and we really

344
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,180
want to be a part of the development of

345
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:41,300
the rest of the internet and as the

346
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,550
things ghrelin networks grow so you know

347
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,859
we are reaching out as well to try to

348
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:50,089
understand you know where we can fit in

349
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:52,910
the modern landscape of of options and

350
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:54,740
if you see this tower here the old tower

351
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,439
is actually a tower that burned the

352
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:00,260
little one and the new tower is the

353
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,570
taller one we use on this site we

354
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,160
actually use every available unlicensed

355
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,290
spectrum

356
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,610
soif that's out there so whenever we

357
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,770
want to do something new on this tower

358
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,780
we have to take something down and put

359
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,150
something up in that spectrum or we have

360
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:17,120
to license a link off of it and to free

361
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:20,540
up some space so there's clearly not

362
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:24,440
enough opportunity we'd like to share

363
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:25,760
this information obviously and you know

364
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,589
we have folks here in this picture from

365
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,930
the Federal Communications Commission we

366
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:31,970
also have folks from other tribes so

367
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,310
this was early this was back in probably

368
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:37,029
2000

369
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:38,739
in 2007 and the woman in the kind of

370
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:40,569
pink colored shirt there there's a woman

371
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,920
named Valerie fast horse and she is the

372
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:46,089
IT Director for the Coeur d'Alene Tribe

373
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:49,180
in Idaho and she got out of the military

374
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:51,160
in communications and she came out for

375
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,079
her tribe and visited us during an FCC

376
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,999
meeting and we brought him up the tower

377
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:56,349
then she stood on that battery box and

378
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:58,990
looked around and said are you kidding

379
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,999
me you can do this with Wi-Fi and she

380
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:05,290
got off that box and went home and she

381
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:07,240
built a fiber and Wireless hybridized

382
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,389
network in Coeur d'Alene that makes our

383
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,430
network looked like a hobby so we're

384
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:14,470
actually very glad to share the

385
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:18,329
opportunity and see the opportunities

386
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:21,100
grow and actually increase the

387
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:22,899
availability for the folks to be on and

388
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:26,470
using the products and the and the

389
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:28,360
devices that you are developing so the

390
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:32,220
tribal digital village network looks

391
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,809
like like this we're pretty proud of it

392
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,120
we've rebuilt it three and a half times

393
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:40,120
based on technology changes based on

394
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:45,790
power changes and based on needs of the

395
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:48,629
tribe we're still building and the the

396
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:52,059
growth now is how to increase quality

397
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:53,319
which is to make sure that the power

398
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:55,149
never goes down because we don't have a

399
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,589
lot of network problems we have some

400
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:59,620
issues with the Sun occasionally they

401
00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:00,910
have it hides behind the clouds so we

402
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,490
have to make sure that we have access to

403
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:07,720
power all the time we did actually put

404
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:10,120
up generators to support our our battery

405
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,829
solution with the solar and I have to

406
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:14,648
thank Vince Cerf for that vent was very

407
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:16,448
generous in granting us some money to

408
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:18,668
support our power systems to keep a more

409
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:21,579
resilient network through the winter and

410
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:24,220
through the storms we're trying to build

411
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,629
out to approximately 3,000 homes we

412
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,960
currently have access to about half of

413
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:31,659
those homes and and it's an adoption and

414
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,149
awareness process an education process

415
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:35,530
and you know as the kids come home from

416
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:36,760
school and say I can't do my homework

417
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,990
because I don't have internet either

418
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:43,990
grandma or grandpa or the parents are

419
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,140
then signing them up for the TDV service

420
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,640
or another internet so

421
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,830
this and they're getting their kids

422
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,420
online and it's weird because the kids

423
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,610
are teaching all the adults how do they

424
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,200
use the internet it's not no none of the

425
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,229
adults not out of the user internet and

426
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,150
it's it's completely in Reverse

427
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,070
it's interesting to see a tribal leader

428
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,600
that won't know how to turn on a

429
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:05,300
computer or now has never used a

430
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:09,679
computer to come up to me on the sidebar

431
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:11,300
on a meeting and say hey Matt can can

432
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,150
you increase the bandwidth to our

433
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,970
reservation because because my grandson

434
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,920
is playing you know this video game or

435
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,840
working on this piece of homework and

436
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,750
he's watching a video that's

437
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:27,050
instructional and that video is skipping

438
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:28,430
and loading slow and I don't really know

439
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:31,550
what that means but can you work on that

440
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:34,730
for me and so it's kind of a cool shift

441
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:36,919
I've been there for 18 years and it's

442
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,200
really neat to see the you know the

443
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:40,640
advancement in just the wherewithal and

444
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,220
you know the knowledge base the change

445
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,490
in the in the landscape if you will to

446
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:49,550
see that growth at the bottom line there

447
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,930
we actually landed a 10 gig circuit on

448
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:54,440
the east side of our network so that we

449
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:56,630
have redundancy finally and we got it

450
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,630
added much much more favorable price

451
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:03,350
under $3 obviously not in town prices

452
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:06,680
but we were able to then lab leverage

453
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:08,449
that against our existing network our 10

454
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,910
gig at the other side we're able to drop

455
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,140
prices dramatically and become more

456
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,270
affordable to scale

457
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,420
we're actually be able being able to

458
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:20,930
increase speeds to homes so this is the

459
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:24,080
kind of solution that you're going to

460
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:25,760
see moving through opportunity in Indian

461
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,129
country and if you're out there building

462
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,690
fiber or if you're out there connecting

463
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,630
your community or there's an opportunity

464
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:35,390
to use ear 8 to leverage the federal

465
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,980
government subsidy to bring access to a

466
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:41,300
community to a library to school or a

467
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:43,220
head start program be creative the

468
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,129
tribes have learned very well how to

469
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:51,520
leverage federal monies and not trip

470
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:54,410
over the the audit process and actually

471
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,330
facilitate like the dig once protocols

472
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:58,550
that are trying to be implemented

473
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,260
federal money won't pay for the tribe to

474
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:02,510
have its own fiber that it'll only pay

475
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:05,360
for the fiber that goes from A to B to

476
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:07,580
get to the tribes library but when the

477
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,350
trenches open we finally broke the rule

478
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:11,780
to be able to lay conduit and fiber of

479
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:13,340
our own so if you are working on a

480
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,230
project with the tribe on that level and

481
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,270
I know some of you through here work on

482
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:20,600
irate and do different things with with

483
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:22,070
different communities please be creative

484
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,899
in your process and work with the local

485
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,850
community to to open up opportunities

486
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,500
for them to bring fiber into their own

487
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,389
community if you have to trench open or

488
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,250
if you're gonna do then or maybe even

489
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:34,130
build it into your price and opportunity

490
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:38,270
so that they can pay off over time or

491
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:41,000
work some creative financing out I'd

492
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:42,470
throw a bunch of fun pictures in here we

493
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,590
actually gathered a handful of our

494
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:47,809
towers out of a recycle yard I would

495
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:50,840
advise no one on the planet to do that

496
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:53,840
ever it was 120 degrees in El Centro

497
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,699
that day on the left and we actually had

498
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,520
to pick the bolts the nuts and the

499
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,110
washers out of 50 gallon drums and I'm

500
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,690
pretty sure we burned our hands on the

501
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,979
on the metal for the whole afternoon we

502
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,950
all lost weight it was pretty good

503
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:09,050
program we drug up and we drug him home

504
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:11,540
on on a trailer that was designed for

505
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:13,550
what what we thought was good enough and

506
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,960
we ended up burning up the brakes so

507
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:18,050
next time we're gonna get it delivered

508
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,300
in the Box come with instructions on the

509
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:25,100
right side of that photograph you see us

510
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:27,500
using a tool to stand up a tower next to

511
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:31,969
the building and are actually our data

512
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:34,160
center there and you know any tool any

513
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:36,020
opportunity any creativity and right I

514
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,700
mean sometimes you can't get to the top

515
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,800
with the equipment I mean I can walk up

516
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,150
a bit but I can't get up there with the

517
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,149
gear so a lot of times we have to

518
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:47,300
actually get a helicopter employed and

519
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:49,490
this guy was a wizard at the at the

520
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:52,010
stick he he could take eight loads up

521
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,600
and seven loads down in one hour as long

522
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:56,270
as we had somebody unhooking and hooking

523
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,428
at the top in the bottom XP it Nam pilot

524
00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:01,520
he was brilliant he's since retired and

525
00:21:58,429 --> 00:22:04,490
then the other one is you know me and I

526
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,960
carry stuff up the hill so here's here's

527
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,640
what the top of the hill solution looks

528
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,260
like you know we're out there with

529
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,440
chainsaws clearing brush making sure we

530
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,639
don't

531
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,830
have fire hazards we're constantly

532
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:15,500
having to do we debate men and things

533
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,908
like that around our solar panels and

534
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,590
these are the you know these are the big

535
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:19,759
endpoint solutions that nobody's really

536
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,199
thinking about when you're like hey I

537
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:22,340
got this cool app and it's gonna fly

538
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,149
over this network and all these people

539
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,949
are gonna use it

540
00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:26,600
you probably don't ever think that you

541
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:29,029
got to drill holes and rocks to mount

542
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,199
solar panels in between two rocks so

543
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:31,429
that the wind doesn't blow it off

544
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,779
because that's a hundred mile an hour

545
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:35,480
wind on the top of that mountain on a

546
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:37,159
regular basis or hide that hide the

547
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,370
tower and the tree so the tree takes the

548
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:42,679
hit from the wind so there are some

549
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:44,209
interesting scenarios there I was

550
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:45,799
talking about emergency services and

551
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,330
things in our valleys tend to catch on

552
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:49,070
fire we are in California which catches

553
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:51,408
on fire regularly and I do believe we're

554
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:54,408
still on fire today Los Angeles I

555
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:56,659
believe so you know these are some of

556
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:58,700
the things that the internet helps be

557
00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:01,460
able to increase communications and

558
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:04,100
solve problems that red stuff on that

559
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,139
plane is you can hardly see it in that

560
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,879
photograph but he's about to dump that

561
00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:10,189
on one of our communication towers and

562
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:12,049
save it the fires coming up over the

563
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,490
back and our towers right on the edge

564
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:17,120
and it's stuck in the smoke and he's

565
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:18,019
going to hit the tower and save us but

566
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,758
this is what it looks like when you

567
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:22,639
don't save the tower when you you know

568
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,320
the you know homes first then towers

569
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:27,019
while they were fighting homes on this

570
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,279
day and so we lost this tower so there's

571
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:29,750
some devastating stuff out there so

572
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:31,250
we're working with natural disaster

573
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:33,409
we're working in landscapes that you're

574
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,820
just not really expecting you know this

575
00:23:33,409 --> 00:23:36,379
to do would be great to bury fiber out

576
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,470
here but burying fiber on Native

577
00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:40,730
American land is complicated because

578
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:44,600
when there were records of where things

579
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:47,059
were buried those records were burned we

580
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,379
were moved on a regular basis so you

581
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,480
know reference points and things like

582
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:52,610
that got a little muddy and we couldn't

583
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,470
figure out like was it here by that tree

584
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,699
or was it this tree where this went this

585
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,470
happened so there's a lot of

586
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,330
complication and digging across native

587
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,460
land so a lot of it ends up being this

588
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,750
way and then you get grumpy people

589
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,980
people that understand the internet you

590
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,769
didn't do a good job on your outreach

591
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:08,029
and education and and they get mad and

592
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:12,679
they come up and they break your stuff

593
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:13,970
so do a better job a little bit of

594
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:15,710
demographics we have somebody watching

595
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,070
some of our traffic and are taking a

596
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,090
look at what we're what we're doing and

597
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,040
interestingly enough that's the

598
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,879
breakdown on how

599
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:28,510
kind of play on the Internet crazy

600
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,580
enough the number one site is Instagram

601
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:32,890
as far as like contact and then the

602
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,659
number one site expectedly is Netflix

603
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:38,140
but typically Facebook's the number one

604
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:41,950
tribal communities are very very visual

605
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:43,420
less word oriented and Instagram plays

606
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:47,080
into that very well and then YouTube as

607
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:49,450
well so it makes a lot of sense and

608
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,520
interestingly enough the traffic on

609
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,200
Instagram doesn't go to the outside

610
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,530
world

611
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:58,810
it goes to another reservation like 89%

612
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,280
of the time the contact on Instagram is

613
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,169
watching people from other reservations

614
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,370
and communities that are within the

615
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:08,950
tribal community of Southern California

616
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:14,560
and then the median age is pretty

617
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:16,240
dramatic drop to and I kind of already

618
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:20,800
covered this so we'll just skip that's a

619
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,870
bunch of words and that's me so I I do

620
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,360
have about four and a half minutes or so

621
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:27,610
for for questions and I be more than

622
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,990
happy to answer any questions but I just

623
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,219
wanted to kind of gloss over the fact

624
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:32,350
that you know I'm coming from a

625
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,690
situation where I used to build from the

626
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,980
ground up and I'm still affiliated with

627
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:38,800
that group and I'm still doing their

628
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:41,020
policy work and helping them fight the

629
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,280
fight at the FCC and then Congress and

630
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,550
things to be able to continue

631
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:48,100
opportunities however I am also now

632
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:49,960
working with Arcadian infra comm and I

633
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,179
am building from the top down I'm

634
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,390
changing the landscape with my team of

635
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:58,180
people and we are dragging that monster

636
00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,220
fibre path right next to and on to

637
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:02,560
reservations and small towns in the USA

638
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,300
and bringing that opportunity and so

639
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,220
that more networks like the tdv network

640
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,680
can be stood up either by the tribe or

641
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,850
by partner organizations or by some of

642
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:12,370
the efforts that you're doing here in

643
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:14,169
the room and partnering with folks to to

644
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,909
do outreach to do ear aid to do things

645
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:18,640
like that and and we're more than eager

646
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:20,200
to to open the door to the opportunity

647
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,420
so the Native communities and excited

648
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,970
about the future of what that can bring

649
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:26,970
so if there are any questions on one

650
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:35,970
yeah Martin levy CloudFlare can you

651
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:40,800
explain the licensing issues within the

652
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:42,540
tribal lands in regards to the FCC is

653
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,540
there any difference or is there any

654
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:47,670
subtlety or anything in your favor so we

655
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:49,139
would love for there to be a difference

656
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:55,830
we would love to be able to say that our

657
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:57,090
sovereignty covered spectrum but the you

658
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,570
got to remember the United States

659
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:03,899
recognized Native Americans as humans in

660
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:05,460
1926 and the reservation system was long

661
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,780
after they took control and created the

662
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,270
United States and therefore it is a

663
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,970
resource that has been allocated to the

664
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,710
u.s. itself and it supersedes the

665
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,320
reservation system and we have no claim

666
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,670
to it it's very unfortunate we are

667
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,889
sovereign dependents we are not

668
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,720
sovereign independence of the United

669
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:23,400
States government and so we do not have

670
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,980
any favor when it comes to that as a

671
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:29,550
resource or a utility you know like our

672
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:32,430
possession we have over the years been

673
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:35,190
able to I don't know if it's tug on the

674
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:38,040
heartstrings or or you know make a case

675
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:39,870
for the opportunity to be able to like

676
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,570
let tribes have a shot at it before

677
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:44,159
somebody else gets it but you know

678
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:45,840
that's that's about all the leverage we

679
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:50,760
have at this point it's unfortunate

680
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:54,090
thank you yeah thank you Jim for Vogel
