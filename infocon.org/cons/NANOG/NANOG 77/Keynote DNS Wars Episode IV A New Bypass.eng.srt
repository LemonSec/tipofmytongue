1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,540
good morning when I was digging through

2
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,880
the closet looking for nano

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,680
t-shirts the most recent and sort of

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:26,020
least ripped up when I could find was

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:27,669
this one which is from 2010 so thank you

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,720
for inviting me back it has been that

7
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:34,930
long since I was here so I am indeed

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:38,019
gonna talk about DNS wars sorry I won't

9
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:40,660
be here Wednesday to hear the talk that

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,550
will be given then but there's an awful

11
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,319
lot to know so I expect they're gonna

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,790
cover a lot of the technical details on

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,670
Wednesday and when I'm here to tell you

14
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:54,970
about is the socio-economic and possibly

15
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:57,670
anthropologic aspects of the problem so

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:01,600
there has been a war for control of the

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:06,280
DNS resolution path going into its third

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,439
decade now and the reason for that is

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,689
obvious to anybody who works in DNS

20
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:14,259
because we get so many queries to our

21
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:17,770
servers which are the enable the enabler

22
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:20,470
is the enabling event of some tcp/ip

23
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,690
session so pretty much before anything

24
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,150
else good or bad happens on the internet

25
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,810
a DNS query is made and there are a lot

26
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:31,120
of them and answering them as important

27
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,909
turns out also that being able to

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,780
observe them is important and there are

29
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:39,549
both good non-controversial and bad

30
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,370
controversial ways to do that

31
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:43,750
observation I'm going to cover that I

32
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,700
want to tell you a little bit about the

33
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:49,810
history so that you can contextualize

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:53,619
what is happening today with the web

35
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:55,299
community the w3c and the IETF working

36
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:58,299
groups that work on the web

37
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:00,010
and their apparent interest in DNS and

38
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:04,479
how that is manifesting because it will

39
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:08,130
change some of what you can do today in

40
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,130
ways that you may or may not care about

41
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:14,620
but first let me begin with what's also

42
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,349
happening I don't want to cover this in

43
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:20,540
detail but I want to say that the idea

44
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:25,839
of making a DNS query

45
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:28,549
seems archaic to some and so there is a

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,000
series of technologies called

47
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:34,459
collectively resolver lists DNS the idea

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,920
here is that if you receive a web object

49
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:38,870
let's say it's an index.html file and

50
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,260
it's going to have some references for

51
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:46,730
images JavaScript files style files that

52
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:48,950
kind of thing the browser is doing the

53
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,350
best it can it is parsing that index

54
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:54,560
file as it comes over the TCP connection

55
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:58,160
and every time it discovers a reference

56
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,200
it starts a DNS query for that and if

57
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,709
possible will also fetch that object in

58
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,589
parallel so it maximizes parallelism

59
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:09,110
however there is still some extra time

60
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,600
for that question to be sent somewhere

61
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:17,420
and for an answer to be then found and

62
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:20,810
returned the money that makes all of our

63
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:23,859
cool web stuff possible is not coming

64
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:27,709
from the G suite is not coming from

65
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:29,720
newspapers per se it's not coming from

66
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:33,799
us it's coming from the advertising

67
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:36,320
industry and they care a lot about being

68
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,060
able to target their ads and also they

69
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,680
care quite a bit about delivering those

70
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,900
ads as quickly as possible

71
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,220
there's a metric that I call time to

72
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,450
next eyeball which is the number of

73
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,130
nanoseconds between when you stop

74
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,500
clicking the mouse and when the first

75
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,900
photon of the next ad hits your eyeball

76
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:58,760
they are always looking for ways to

77
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:00,140
reduce this so after I tell you the rest

78
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,060
of the story I hope that you will

79
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,640
remember that this is also coming and

80
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,829
therefore we are not at the the the

81
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,170
bottom yet they are going to be

82
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:11,630
including DNS bindings in other words

83
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,880
this name has that address in the meta

84
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,650
headers of web objects so that the

85
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:19,159
browser will not have to make a separate

86
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:22,490
query there will be no DNS SEC involved

87
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,289
so the browser's ability to reject bad

88
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:28,780
information let's say from a website

89
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:32,539
defacement event it will be non-existent

90
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,200
but if you were in the advertising

91
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:35,150
business

92
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,650
you cared about the time to next eyeball

93
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,159
this is the kind of thing that you would

94
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,929
come up with we could even struggle a

95
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,020
little bit and see that the web was born

96
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:49,990
inside the internet and now wants to

97
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:55,419
leave home anyway so do read up on this

98
00:04:49,990 --> 00:05:00,610
they need some counsel at best so

99
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:04,400
history in town in what is now Germany

100
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:08,780
called Westphalia some people met in

101
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,599
1648 in order to execute some treaties

102
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:16,400
they wanted to end the 30 Years War and

103
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,800
also the 70 years war and you know the

104
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,750
war was I guess beneficial in some

105
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,790
economic sense for a while but it had

106
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,890
begun costing them too much it so

107
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,140
everybody pretty much wanted to stop

108
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,669
fighting but they had a problem which

109
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,840
was there were too many parties who

110
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:35,870
wanted to be at the table to conduct the

111
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,719
negotiations and they had to find a way

112
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,840
to exclude those who were not strictly

113
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,950
necessary and that is where our modern

114
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,479
definition of a nation came from it was

115
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:50,210
those people trying to figure out who

116
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:53,150
would be allowed to sit at the table and

117
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:57,770
negotiate this peace and what they came

118
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:59,750
up with not unreasonable is that we will

119
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,180
treat you as a nation if you have a

120
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,310
defined order if you have you

121
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,560
demonstrate the ability to govern within

122
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,780
that border especially to keep people

123
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,150
from inside that border from attacking

124
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:14,150
their neighbors because that would be

125
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,520
seen as an act of war and if you can

126
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,849
defend the border against outsiders so

127
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,710
basically this codified the rule of the

128
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,150
strongest if you are strong enough to do

129
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,640
these things we will treat you as a

130
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,640
nation and you may sit here at this

131
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,710
table and negotiate with us now the

132
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:35,450
United States of America did not exist

133
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:37,729
at that time nevertheless this is the

134
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,500
same definition of nationhood give or

135
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,600
take a couple of words that we use today

136
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,919
it is what the United Nations uses and

137
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,819
what's interesting about

138
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,310
this definition is at that time the

139
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:54,879
domain of operations either for people

140
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:59,150
for companies such as they then were

141
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:02,479
wealthy families and nations were just

142
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:05,479
land and sea they knew all about getting

143
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:10,039
superiority the ability to control piece

144
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:12,289
of land or a piece of sea and everything

145
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:13,219
that they thought about treaties and

146
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:14,930
everything they thought about the

147
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:17,719
definition of nations and the ability

148
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,250
let's say to defend your borders was

149
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:22,009
written in terms of the first two

150
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:25,789
domains of operation that were at that

151
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:29,090
time known so we cannot fault them for

152
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:32,029
not seeing forward in time and saying

153
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,919
wait when there's a guy in a biplane to

154
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:37,159
the machine-gun these borders are going

155
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,960
to get kind of fuzzy we can also forgive

156
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:41,688
them for not understanding things like

157
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,789
bird flu which also do not respect

158
00:07:41,689 --> 00:07:49,610
borders but I think if you stare down

159
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:52,878
this list of air sea space and I guess

160
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:55,339
quantum is going to be number six you

161
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,139
will quickly get the idea that the

162
00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:02,210
definition of the nation is not as

163
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:04,400
useful now as it was in 1648 there are

164
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,190
many people who think that we are now in

165
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,318
the post national era that code is law

166
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:12,159
and that we are going to have direct

167
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:15,379
control of our destinies without

168
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:17,539
governments without nations I don't

169
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:19,400
agree with that I'm not going to get

170
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:23,150
into the reasons why but I do want to

171
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:26,719
say there is a lot of pressure to figure

172
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:29,210
out what a nation is in the in a world

173
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:31,129
that has IT in it which is completely

174
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:34,338
borderless unless you count the Great

175
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:36,560
Firewall of China but a hierarchy of

176
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:38,870
values within the domains that you are

177
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:42,619
then aware of is ideally you'd like to

178
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:44,660
have a supremacy and if you can't get

179
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,990
that you'd like to have parity detent

180
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:50,240
and worst case you'd like to at least be

181
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:52,070
aware of that domain rather than being

182
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,220
surprised that all of a sudden you are

183
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,410
being attacked or kicked around in some

184
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,190
way using a domain of operations that

185
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:07,550
you learn

186
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:11,840
that day existed so you know so talking

187
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:13,099
about DNS this is the traditional

188
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,570
architecture I'm going to walk you

189
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,090
through it most of you know this stuff

190
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,770
but to the you know dozen or so who

191
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:22,220
wandered in here wondering what we were

192
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:24,439
meeting about today I will say that DNS

193
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:27,200
only has three types of protocol

194
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,820
speakers there are hundreds of millions

195
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,860
of them collectively and they send

196
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,870
hundreds of billions of packets to each

197
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,770
other every day but all of it boils down

198
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:40,160
to one of these three types so your

199
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:43,160
laptop is probably an example of a stub

200
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,839
resolver at the bottom my laptop is an

201
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,430
example of the recursive server but

202
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:52,880
that's probably not your your game so

203
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:54,800
stuber's Oliver gets a DNS server IP as

204
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,230
part of getting its IP address so as

205
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,780
part of a DHCP transaction it will be

206
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,700
told and in addition to telling you what

207
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,650
your gateway is your address

208
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:07,130
maybe the netmask I'm also going to give

209
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:08,900
you some DNS servers we don't have to

210
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,140
use those and indeed a lot of people

211
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:15,770
done they override this to use 8.8 1.1

212
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:18,260
9.9 or you know something or they might

213
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:21,770
send it to their corporate VPN there are

214
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:24,080
good reasons to do that nevertheless the

215
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,510
stub resolver is certainly now almost

216
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,550
tabula rasa it knows where to send its

217
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:32,150
queries and that's all it knows the

218
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:35,750
server it is sending to is the most

219
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:38,120
complicated of the three that thing has

220
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,530
the job of answering from its cache if

221
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,680
you ask it for something that has

222
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:44,449
already recently enough discovered or

223
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,089
going upstream to the authority servers

224
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,520
to get the information you need if the

225
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:51,500
if it's not already in cache so that

226
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,600
middle box the recursive server is where

227
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,070
all the complexity all the bugs all the

228
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,970
cert advisories all the DDoS is

229
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:02,000
everything that can go wrong in DNS goes

230
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,220
wrong in that middle box the top the

231
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,950
authority servers is where data enters

232
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,300
the system from the outside right DNS is

233
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,830
not all-knowing you have to

234
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,920
other things so that it can carry that

235
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,870
information around for you and you'll

236
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,020
note that there is traditionally at

237
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:20,110
least in enterprises in IP firewall so

238
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,670
that the recursive server is the only

239
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,650
device or whatever set of recursive

240
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,449
servers you have are the only ones

241
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:29,120
allowed to talk to authorities servers

242
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:34,070
and that keeps shadow IT from occurring

243
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,900
and also gives you kind of a control

244
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,670
point for cybersecurity and I'm going to

245
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,400
come to some examples of that in a

246
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:43,760
moment in any case that's how it was

247
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:46,340
built and it has scaled nine orders of

248
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,290
magnitude without changing this basic

249
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,600
picture and I think that means that if

250
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:55,910
you meet Paul Mike a Petro somewhere you

251
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:59,240
owe him a glass of red wine this is the

252
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:01,790
topology that we had in the middle of

253
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,750
commercialization and privatization now

254
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:08,810
I came to a meeting that later got

255
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:11,270
renamed Nanog Elise gerich was running

256
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:14,359
the regional text meeting and invited me

257
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:17,750
to come talk about DNS before the name

258
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,790
Nanog was was coined so at that time we

259
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,760
didn't have a fully developed commercial

260
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:26,949
internet but by 1999 we pretty much did

261
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:30,500
and it pretty much looked like this and

262
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:32,000
for the purpose of ours DNS story what I

263
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,580
want you to realize is that there was a

264
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,320
time that servers were so expensive

265
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,380
computers were so expensive that you

266
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,350
might only have one and so your apps and

267
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,090
your login shells and your recursive

268
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,580
name server we're probably all running

269
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:50,150
on one box and that box might have some

270
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:53,030
kind of a 56k link to CS net or

271
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:55,699
something like that eventually we got

272
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,680
Ethernet and we started getting Sun

273
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,440
workstations and other cheap devices and

274
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,770
it became possible to have a whole

275
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,920
collection of cooperating internet hosts

276
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:09,470
inside of some campus and we moved the

277
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,699
server off to the land we just said you

278
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,680
know I'm not going to put a server on

279
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,660
every workstation that would be hard to

280
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,969
manage so I'll just put one on the land

281
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,980
somewhere then we got campuses moved the

282
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,230
servers to the campus because again it

283
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,649
doesn't take very much computational

284
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,240
horse

285
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:25,430
or to run one of these there's no reason

286
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,949
to put one on every land if you've got

287
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:32,479
50 lands in a campus in Santa Clara

288
00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:35,118
somewhere when we got ISPs instead of

289
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,649
having to make our own internet by you

290
00:13:35,119 --> 00:13:39,920
know finding a bunch of people to appear

291
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:42,529
with the ISP said hey you can you can

292
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,559
just send your recursive DNS traffic to

293
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:47,569
us and we will handle that for all of

294
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,459
our customers and they know it's not a

295
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:51,860
bad idea because those people were

296
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:54,079
usually on top of things they knew that

297
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,779
okay there's a bug in bind or whatever I

298
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,489
gotta fix that today whereas not every

299
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:01,819
one of their commercial customers had

300
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:03,379
that level of awareness but although I

301
00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:05,269
don't have any animation to show it I

302
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:07,220
want you to imagine that the recursive

303
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:10,970
name server started in the bottom box

304
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,649
and successively moved one box away two

305
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,480
boxes three locks it keeps getting

306
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:21,589
further away from where the questions

307
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:25,490
are coming this will continue so that

308
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:29,870
was the situation going into the new

309
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:31,579
millennium and various people came into

310
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,290
this and said hey there's got to be a

311
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:35,479
way to monetize I need to

312
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,189
disintermediate I need to disrupt the

313
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:41,709
old economy I need to make a lot of

314
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:45,290
money and buy flashy cars and get out so

315
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:47,719
the first major attack a number of minor

316
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:50,120
attacks but their first major attack on

317
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:54,100
the DNS resolution path came from

318
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:56,509
Verisign they were running dot-com and

319
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,790
they were looking at their server logs

320
00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:00,499
and they said gee a lot of people ask us

321
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,089
questions for which our answer is

322
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:04,370
negative right they've had a

323
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:06,049
typographical error they've typed

324
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,670
something that doesn't exist yet they've

325
00:15:06,049 --> 00:15:10,519
typed something that has recently

326
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:14,299
expired whatever it is what can we do

327
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:16,759
with that data and so they did what now

328
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:18,410
is seems quite common but was

329
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:22,339
controversial for the moment which was

330
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:25,429
to keep all of your negative answers and

331
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:27,769
use them as keywords to figure out what

332
00:15:25,429 --> 00:15:29,089
ads they might be able to sell they

333
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:31,579
partnered with a company called site

334
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:32,360
finder and then one day they added a

335
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:34,880
wild car

336
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,470
to the top of the dot-com zone so that

337
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,689
they were no longer able to produce

338
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,000
negative answers you would I had to get

339
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,890
a real answer that was what you were

340
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,600
looking for or you would get a synthetic

341
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:48,920
answer that was a pointer to the site

342
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:51,649
finder search engine so a lot of people

343
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,569
got pretty upset about this I somewhere

344
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:56,480
have a t-shirt that was made for us by

345
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:59,149
Olaf Coleman he and I were both on the

346
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,160
ICANN's security and stability Advisory

347
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:03,440
Committee at the time and since all of

348
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,980
us had been named as co-conspirators in

349
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,740
Vera signs lawsuit against I can he made

350
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,800
a t-shirt so I am actually an accredited

351
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,029
very crime co-conspirator I quit and I

352
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,069
should have worn that shirt today I

353
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:22,189
suppose but that ended as things do

354
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:25,100
first my company internet systems

355
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:27,170
consortium where I would then worked put

356
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,510
out a patch to bind that undid the

357
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:33,500
effect of this and it was really really

358
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:35,060
ugly thing but it worked and it made a

359
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,560
lot of people angry and probably would

360
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:40,010
have earned me my own lawsuit if they

361
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,500
weren't already suing I can but

362
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:48,290
eventually everybody went away happy and

363
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:50,720
it was all good next up OpenDNS came

364
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,670
along and said you know I see how you

365
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,170
have moved the recursive server further

366
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,959
and further from where the questions

367
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,550
come from and that's all good but we

368
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,430
think we could move it even further away

369
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,979
so we're going to put an anycast

370
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,409
recursive DNS service in however many

371
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,299
metros they could then afford to do so

372
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,890
that you would go through your ISP

373
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:11,150
through that internet cloudy thing

374
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,549
that's in the middle of most of our

375
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,760
diagrams out the other side to reach a

376
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:19,490
recursive service and they tried the

377
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,900
same thing sciFinder had done but they

378
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,730
didn't make any money at it so they gave

379
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,130
up so the whole idea about sending

380
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,589
people to an advertising server based on

381
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,090
the DNS question they asked has never

382
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:32,360
really made a lot of money for anybody

383
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:34,040
but they all think of it but they failed

384
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:37,939
fast and they tried the next thing which

385
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:40,490
was to answer differently for google.com

386
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:44,400
they gave the address of their own

387
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:46,260
search page this was seen as

388
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,490
you might expect as controversial by

389
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:52,110
Google and so I'm sure phone calls were

390
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,790
made and questions were asked and

391
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:59,100
demands were issued and ultimately

392
00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:00,899
OpenDNS said look we don't have a search

393
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,149
engine we just have a search page and

394
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,270
we're collecting the keywords so that we

395
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:08,430
can figure out what that stub resolver

396
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:10,650
cares about so that we can help our

397
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:12,900
advertising customers tag target their

398
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,670
ads and then after they hit the I'm

399
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,980
feeling lucky button on our page we're

400
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:19,110
just redirecting them to you Google so

401
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,490
you still get all the money and all the

402
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,050
data that you were going to get you see

403
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,270
everything that you were seeing before

404
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:25,889
and you get a chance to answer with your

405
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,840
own ads and all the rest of that stuff

406
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,940
so you know please

407
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,090
just calm down this is not a big deal

408
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:35,310
and you know I did not work at Google at

409
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,870
the time and I can't say that there was

410
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:40,820
cause and effect here but I will say

411
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:44,219
that within 45 days Google created 8.8

412
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,899
which is what I would have done in

413
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,210
response to that kind of thing which is

414
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,670
well if you're going to try to take

415
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:53,160
traffic away from us then I guess we're

416
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:55,950
gonna have to take the traffic back so

417
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:59,030
they were in other words to reestablish

418
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:03,690
the status quo

419
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:07,020
finally when so many recursive services

420
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:10,080
were any casted it no longer it was no

421
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:13,710
longer possible for a web server to look

422
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,480
at the the IP address of a DNS query

423
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,790
that was coming to you know the

424
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,850
authority server for example come and

425
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:23,280
use that IP address as a good predictor

426
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:26,550
of where a subsequent web fetch in other

427
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,370
words a TCP connection on port 80 with

428
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:32,520
them come from and since they were using

429
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:35,129
the location of your DNS server as a

430
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,410
proxy for your likely location in other

431
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:41,250
words which of their the many mirrors of

432
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:44,700
a CDN should you be told to fetch this

433
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:47,730
kind of broke things and as a result

434
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,680
we've have added quite against my will I

435
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:53,900
might add something called a DNS client

436
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:57,039
subnet by which the cache miss traffic

437
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:00,049
see if I can make us go backward here

438
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:03,260
the cache miss traffic above the

439
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:05,418
recursive ends up containing the network

440
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,280
portion of the address of the stuff

441
00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:08,450
resolver

442
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,760
it's not supposed to be the full address

443
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:13,460
because that would be an information

444
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:17,090
leak right it tends to be the full

445
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:19,580
address most of the IOT devices didn't

446
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,610
read that part of the e CS RFC there

447
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,980
including the entire address

448
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:26,830
nevertheless it's an information leak

449
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:30,860
even if all it has is your network

450
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:34,100
according to me and that a DNS client

451
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:36,469
subnet is such a disaster for privacy

452
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:40,399
that not even CloudFlare will support it

453
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:43,190
so people using 1.1 are not getting the

454
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,429
CDN effects other than when they're

455
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:49,669
talking to web properties that

456
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:51,110
CloudFlare themselves publishes but

457
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:53,240
these are you know three different times

458
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,668
that folks have said the dns resolution

459
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,840
path doesn't have enough of me in it so

460
00:20:55,669 --> 00:21:01,220
where can I in interpose so now we're

461
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,899
doing this again but I wanted you to

462
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:08,360
have that context so now as I said we're

463
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,520
going further than we used to go the

464
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:14,270
recursive name server has now moved to

465
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:16,490
the pretty much last point unless we put

466
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:18,440
it on another planet it cannot get

467
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:22,789
further from the place where the

468
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:25,640
questions enter but because it is sort

469
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:28,250
of not topologically nearby where the

470
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,320
campus or the lan is we've got this a

471
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,299
dns client subnet so some of the dns

472
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,629
information is also being transmitted to

473
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:37,100
the CDN and for a while it looked like

474
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:40,340
everybody was getting everything they

475
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,809
wanted and that we would stop but no

476
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,149
actually it turned out there were a lot

477
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:45,710
of people worried about this because

478
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,230
when you move something further away and

479
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:50,270
you add more intermediate parties you

480
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:53,870
give a lot more people a chance to

481
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:56,299
monitor what's going on dns does have

482
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,370
some security but that's only on

483
00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:00,200
authentication of the data in other

484
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,570
words you can receive something that is

485
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,940
false and no it's false but it won't

486
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,120
have been a secret from anybody between

487
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:10,650
you and

488
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:12,300
in the far hand and so this was one of

489
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:15,090
the things that Edward Snowden disclosed

490
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:18,750
about when he flew to Hong Kong in 2013

491
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:22,260
and the ATF got very excited about this

492
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:27,180
and decided that they were going to

493
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:28,980
encrypt everything and we encrypted the

494
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:32,040
DNS was so importantly encrypted it

495
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:35,460
twice so the first thing that happened

496
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:38,790
was DNS over TLS so it's a very

497
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,560
straightforward tcp-based vertical you

498
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,990
connect to exchange keys and then you

499
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,300
exchange your questions and answers but

500
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:48,990
they also improved quite a bit of the

501
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,669
old DNS TCP protocol which was hokey so

502
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:53,850
this is a solid protocol and in my

503
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:57,210
opinion if you combine DNS over TLS with

504
00:22:53,850 --> 00:23:00,990
what's called TCP fast open we could

505
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:02,640
stop using UDP we've got a way to manage

506
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,230
the state load down we've got a good

507
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,490
enough transport protocol and we could

508
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:10,680
actually take DNS out of UDP however

509
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:13,530
that did not solve an important problem

510
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:17,340
that the web portion of the IETF saw

511
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:19,620
which was although it was unreadable it

512
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,090
was still quite apparent that a DNS

513
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:25,439
query was happening because it had a

514
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:27,030
dedicated port number 8 v 3 and that

515
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,130
also meant that those of us with

516
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,750
firewalls were capable of blocking that

517
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,990
and I think I showed you on the

518
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:36,090
architecture page that I do block the

519
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:39,000
outbound DNS unless it's coming from my

520
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:42,240
servers because to me DNS is a very good

521
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,430
control point for cyber security but

522
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,620
these folks did not like that and so

523
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:48,990
they came up with their own protocol

524
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:53,189
just published a year or so after d-o-t

525
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:55,220
it's called do H and all hell has broken

526
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:59,490
loose

527
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:02,520
here's the modified architecture stuff

528
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:04,620
you see on the right with the RPC that's

529
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:07,800
response policy zones that's a way to

530
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:10,110
insert policy into your recursive server

531
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,290
you might not want it to answer for the

532
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:17,340
command and control names of today's DG

533
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:19,110
a botnet for example and DNS tap is an

534
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,049
open protocol also developed

535
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:25,049
my team by which you can sort of write

536
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:28,139
one observation tool for your DNS and it

537
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:30,030
won't be based on pcap or BPF the name

538
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,220
server will actually export its dilemma

539
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:35,309
tree to whatever you configure it to

540
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,290
export to so that was our Edition and

541
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:40,889
over on the left you'll see the doah

542
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:43,409
people who are now got apps doing dns in

543
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:45,450
particular web browsers they are

544
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:49,850
speaking to recursive servers and

545
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:53,970
they're doing it over TCP port 443 and

546
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:55,770
thus bypassing the firewall and then you

547
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,750
consider this a good design because that

548
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,820
firewall might be an authoritarian

549
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:02,960
regime and there may be dissidents and

550
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:06,809
you know don't we all want more freedom

551
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,910
in any case this is going to be a

552
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:11,610
problem for those of us who still want

553
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:13,919
to have firewalls if it's a problem for

554
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,719
an authoritative regime somewhere

555
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,220
they're probably not going to ask my

556
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,040
opinion so I'm not going to give it to

557
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,840
them but it's a problem for me and so

558
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,540
I'm going to tell you what's going on

559
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,639
there now I want to say first and

560
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,559
foremost this is not a technology

561
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,870
project they did not have a

562
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,230
technological statement of work their

563
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,918
problem statement had nothing to do with

564
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:38,940
performance it was all about

565
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:42,270
eavesdropping and being able block and

566
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,490
in the history that I have lived we have

567
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:47,490
not successfully solved a political

568
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:52,049
problem using technology means all we do

569
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:54,360
is a tick and then our opposition has

570
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:56,160
the talk and we just kind of keep going

571
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,918
back and forth and everybody takes their

572
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:03,150
turn making things more complicated and

573
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:06,150
worse also this doesn't give you very

574
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:09,299
much in the way of privacy because if

575
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,620
you're not in tor or some other VPN then

576
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:13,980
the next thing you're gonna do after you

577
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:16,379
get a DNS answer is make a TCP syn

578
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,090
packet and send that out and you know

579
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,590
that might be to a CDN that's got 2

580
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:22,080
million hosts in which case it's a

581
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:25,290
little hard to guess which of those

582
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,990
virtual hosts you're talking to but that

583
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:30,149
is not the norm

584
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,799
that's not even half the traffic I see

585
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:33,418
so most of the time you can guess what

586
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:36,480
answer they got based on what they do

587
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:39,240
next and if you have a passive DNS

588
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,039
database which I do it's very easy to go

589
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,679
from the answer you think they got to

590
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,000
the question they must have asked so in

591
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,890
other words if you want to keep a

592
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,899
dissident out of jail teach them how to

593
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:50,700
use tor don't don't tell them that deal

594
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:53,039
h is gonna keep them out of jail because

595
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,140
they may know may or may not be phoning

596
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,590
you from jail if they're allowed to do

597
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,240
so

598
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:59,399
complaining about the bad advice you

599
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,470
gave them and if you're gonna use a VPN

600
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:03,178
you certainly don't need do H you're

601
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:06,720
just going to put all your DNS traffic

602
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:09,929
in the VPN so this is not just a

603
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,970
political project it is a problem -

604
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:16,080
excuse me a solution to a problem we're

605
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:18,210
not having but it will create problems

606
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,960
that we didn't have before so maybe that

607
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:23,429
is also part of the point at 18 minutes

608
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,260
I'm gonna skip some of these details but

609
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:32,210
these slides will be available to you

610
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:36,240
later the biggest single issue for me is

611
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:38,340
that I am NOT an authoritarian country I

612
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,039
am an authoritarian that's why I have a

613
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:44,129
firewall there are things that my

614
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:47,850
employees or my children or my servers

615
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:49,980
are not allowed to do and that's not

616
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,010
necessarily a bad thing I'm sure that my

617
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,770
children used to complain about that but

618
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:57,330
in general this is how we do it and I've

619
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:59,820
had a lot of people come to me and say

620
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:02,100
that that's archaic you shouldn't do

621
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:06,418
that firewalls or 1990s technology you

622
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:09,689
should secure your endpoints that's hard

623
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:12,120
I don't explain in a moment but let me

624
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,950
also just say that there is a theory

625
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,719
under which the Chinese Communist Party

626
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,299
has a budget that there's a maximum

627
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,520
amount of electric power human effort

628
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:23,789
human time and money that they are

629
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:25,289
willing to spend making sure that they

630
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:27,658
have thought control across their

631
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:29,490
population and so there's a theory that

632
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:33,240
if we make this too complicated for them

633
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:35,340
then it will be like the Cold War with

634
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,789
the Soviet Union we will out spend them

635
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,709
and

636
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:39,359
they will eventually their economy will

637
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,950
collapse and so forth let me tell you

638
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,600
that I've been to China a fair bit I

639
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:47,070
have friends I have businesses I have

640
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:48,869
partners and there is no such limit they

641
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:52,678
have all the money and they will spend

642
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:54,330
the last electron on earth maintaining

643
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:56,519
their regime so making it more

644
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:59,249
complicated for them is just the next

645
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:02,909
step in a long game this won't be

646
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:05,249
decisive in other words so let me tell

647
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:07,200
you about securing the endpoint it's a

648
00:29:05,249 --> 00:29:10,619
wonderful article out there on medium

649
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,889
you can find it by googling for

650
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:15,629
everything is broken medium the NSA is

651
00:29:13,889 --> 00:29:18,840
doing so well because software is

652
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:20,789
 these are just quotes that I

653
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,678
pulled out to incent you to go Google

654
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:25,289
for this the next time you think your

655
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:27,239
grandma is uncool give her credit for

656
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:29,489
her time helping dangerous Russian

657
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:35,279
criminals extort money from offshore

658
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:36,869
casinos with DDoS attacks see is good

659
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,029
for two things being beautiful and

660
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:44,220
creating catastrophic zero days in

661
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:47,009
memory management and most importantly

662
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,779
when we tell you to apply updates we're

663
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:50,580
not telling you to mend your ship we're

664
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:54,330
telling you to keep bailing before the

665
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:56,340
water gets to your neck so the reason

666
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,499
that I'm using DNS as a control point

667
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:02,279
for cyber security is because I can't

668
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:06,239
secure my influence my Smart TV has got

669
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:08,220
no defense at all and it you know mine

670
00:30:06,239 --> 00:30:11,519
has not been caught running a Bitcoin

671
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,470
miner in JavaScript but others have and

672
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,679
so the way that I figure out which of my

673
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,749
influence needs some attention today so

674
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,970
that I can secure my endpoints as I'm

675
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:24,179
being advised to do is by looking at the

676
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:27,029
DNS data that you know what questions is

677
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:27,960
it asking and you know is it asking a

678
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:29,909
question that's completely

679
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,429
uncharacteristic and if it is that

680
00:30:29,909 --> 00:30:35,820
that's the reason that I go visit it and

681
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:39,210
I'm not alone this business of kind of

682
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:42,149
doing the best you can and only acting

683
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:44,580
in the presence of an anomaly is how

684
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:46,830
most of my enterprise customers are

685
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,159
securing and their enterprise networks

686
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,669
which

687
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:52,530
might be multinational so I got into a

688
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:55,070
bit of a snit with Google because their

689
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:57,060
chromecast was ignoring my DHCP

690
00:30:55,070 --> 00:31:01,320
assignment of a name server they were

691
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:03,540
sending their DNS queries 28.8 and I was

692
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:07,129
really deeply unhappy about that and I

693
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:10,649
ended up talking to people from there I

694
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:12,750
think there's general knowledge that

695
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:14,790
Vint knows me and so I'm sure somebody

696
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,410
came to them and said could you call

697
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,750
vixy and calm him down

698
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:20,670
and and so I had a meeting with various

699
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,430
people and they couldn't understand why

700
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,750
I was objecting and it was their device

701
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:28,530
just as I paid for it didn't mean that I

702
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:31,470
owned it and the question I wish I had

703
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:34,800
asked is so would you install an IOT

704
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:37,980
device in a Google building on a Google

705
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:41,340
network that was going to send all of

706
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:43,860
its DNS traffic to I don't know 9.9 or

707
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,419
1.1 because I don't think they would I

708
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,030
think they would say I don't trust those

709
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:50,520
people and and yet if I say well I don't

710
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:52,860
trust you they that's something they

711
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:56,310
can't hear anyway that's the general

712
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:59,540
attitude is that we're just the

713
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:59,540
caretakers of these devices

714
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:13,770
good covered all of it so the internet

715
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:18,240
according to some cocktail napkin from

716
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:21,450
1969 is a network of networks the web is

717
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,210
not it is a network of eyeballs it is

718
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:28,919
people consuming ads that put all of the

719
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:32,669
money into the web system and you know

720
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:35,549
so when Google pays Mozilla a hundred

721
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:37,140
million dollars a year for placement of

722
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:39,418
the Google search engine on the front

723
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:42,600
page the default page of the Mozilla

724
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:44,700
Firefox browser that all of that money

725
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:48,299
came from the advertising industry and

726
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,400
what Mozilla begins to break out of this

727
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,530
and try to diversify its income so that

728
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:56,340
they don't have a single single big

729
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:57,780
donor they're gonna be taking money from

730
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,879
other parts of the advertising industry

731
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:03,870
that doesn't mean they're evil

732
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:08,669
what advertisement is not a unalloyed

733
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:10,709
bad but we do have to be honest and say

734
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:15,540
that the web's goals are not the same as

735
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:18,419
the Internet's goals so I don't love the

736
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:21,629
rule of the strongest never have and I'm

737
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:23,910
seeing it appear here there's a whole

738
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:26,429
other effort if you've been to becoming

739
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:29,970
a man-in-the-middle for outbound HTTP

740
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:32,549
you've got a Palo Alto Networks next-gen

741
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:35,419
firewall and it's catching the out

742
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:38,309
bounce in setting up three-way handshake

743
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:40,710
letting the certificate be or the

744
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:44,160
request be sent and then transmitting

745
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:46,140
back a made-up certificate that happens

746
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,410
to have been signed by something in the

747
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:52,890
CA root of the client that's about to

748
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:55,980
stop working that kind of thing really

749
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:58,890
annoys the folks who heard heard

750
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:01,020
everything Snowden had to say and so in

751
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:03,809
TLS version 1.3 they're going to encrypt

752
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:06,299
the SNI you won't know what certificate

753
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:08,820
to transmit you're going to be moving to

754
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:10,668
an explicit proxy for all of that or

755
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,950
you're going to give up and just let

756
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:15,540
outbound HTTP do what it does which for

757
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:19,649
compliance reasons most of you

758
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:24,259
can't do the people who are designing

759
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:27,360
all of this have nothing against you

760
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:29,340
they have got something against somebody

761
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:33,630
who is indistinguishable from you which

762
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:36,360
is some ISP data mining the DNS in order

763
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:38,370
to then attach keywords to their

764
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:42,510
customers so that they can sell

765
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:44,609
advertising targeting and that's where

766
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:50,490
you know elephants are dancing and we

767
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:52,590
just happen to be in the way but I will

768
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:57,240
say that I'm a little bit shocked at how

769
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:59,910
far we've gone the mozilla is going to

770
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:02,220
change the default on firefox in the US

771
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:05,160
if you check your firefox you may

772
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,350
discover that it's already happened

773
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,940
they are not going to ask your

774
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:10,830
permission they're going to tell you

775
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,220
that it is happening and give you a

776
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:17,130
chance to opt out and that data instead

777
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:19,439
of going to whatever system resolver

778
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,630
that operating system is configured with

779
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,240
is going to be going to a trusted

780
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:28,380
recursive resolver chosen for you by

781
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:31,620
mozilla currently the only TRR that i

782
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:36,810
know of is CloudFlare but I feel sure

783
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:40,500
that 99 and even 8.8 are going to apply

784
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:43,290
for that status it wouldn't matter if it

785
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:46,410
wasn't CloudFlare and my friend

786
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:48,300
bertiebear has a ramp that he does where

787
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,830
it talks about National Security Letters

788
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,020
and the fact that if you send your data

789
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:54,450
to the United States you have no idea

790
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,310
who might be able to see it after it's

791
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:59,520
been decrypted because the government

792
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:02,400
has force majeure he's not wrong but I

793
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,410
think that's irrelevant in other words

794
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,720
if we were sending the data to a Dutch

795
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:10,410
company if we were sending the data to

796
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,750
Burt Q bear I would still say changing

797
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,430
my configuration so that it exfiltrate

798
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:21,540
something that I used to control the

799
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:24,870
path of is not okay and this to get us

800
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:27,029
back to the Westphalia example I want to

801
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:27,549
say that there have been a few times in

802
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:30,460
history

803
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:32,230
that a corporation has signed a treaty

804
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:35,050
with a nation for example you think

805
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:37,450
about the Dutch East India Company or

806
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:41,410
the British East India Company signing

807
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:42,970
treaties with various local regimes that

808
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:45,879
they discovered as they traveled the

809
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:47,259
world but those were crown corporations

810
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,430
it was fairly clear to everybody that

811
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:53,410
they represented a government somewhere

812
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:57,069
so when I heard that the UK government

813
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:59,529
had objected to Mozilla's plan and had

814
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:01,810
invited the Mozilla exec team to come to

815
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:03,430
London and talk about it and when there

816
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:06,160
was a press release saying okay so

817
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:09,339
Mozilla has agreed not to automatically

818
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:12,009
change the DNS settings of anybody that

819
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:16,410
they know that for sure is in the United

820
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:19,000
Kingdom this was not good news because

821
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:21,609
they are only the first application

822
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,340
doing dns who had a policy that was

823
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:26,350
controversial if we know anything about

824
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:29,050
the internet is if there's one there

825
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:32,500
will shortly be six million I also want

826
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:35,800
to say that in the root zone of DNS we

827
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:39,760
have 250 or so country codes they aren't

828
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:41,830
all countries but I don't imagine

829
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,360
Mozilla visiting all of them to find out

830
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:46,540
how that country feels about each thing

831
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,010
nor do I imagine anybody who follows in

832
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,470
Mozilla's but steps is going to be

833
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:53,080
wandering around signing treaties with

834
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,700
governments around the world and if I

835
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,740
did imagine that that I would want to

836
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,529
know what is the new definition of

837
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,890
nationhood is it your ability to impose

838
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:04,420
your will

839
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:06,520
regardless supporters in that case we

840
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:10,390
may have to start thinking about Mozilla

841
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:12,960
differently but I am deeply disappointed

842
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:16,390
in them for taking this unilateral

843
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,790
action they are a non-profit public

844
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:22,629
charity they are supposed to act for the

845
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:28,420
public good opt out is never in the

846
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:30,370
public good so there was a time when the

847
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:33,100
only way you could communicate on the

848
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:35,560
internet from end to end was to fit

849
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,779
through all of those holes you had to

850
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,599
speak a protocol that everybody along

851
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,130
the path and

852
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:42,890
the far-end would understand or you

853
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:45,650
wouldn't be heard you had to use only

854
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:47,900
the IP addresses domain names SNS that

855
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:50,180
had been allocated to you and not others

856
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:53,239
could just pick them at random or you

857
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:57,558
would also not be able to communicate so

858
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:59,509
that up until now every communication on

859
00:38:57,559 --> 00:39:02,269
the Internet relied on cooperation and

860
00:38:59,509 --> 00:39:05,380
that cooperation could be withheld you

861
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:08,660
can imagine any of these operators

862
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:11,289
moving the their their particular line

863
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:16,598
segment up or down in order to cause

864
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:19,549
misalignment and that is the old way

865
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:23,539
what we're doing now is we have an

866
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:26,150
internet standard RFC 848 for that on

867
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:29,029
page one says that this protocol is

868
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:32,660
designed to prevent on path interference

869
00:39:29,029 --> 00:39:36,529
in DNS operations in other words they

870
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:39,109
were not shy they were not coy they did

871
00:39:36,529 --> 00:39:40,910
not keep their agenda a secret they are

872
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:44,630
saying that they like those yellow lines

873
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:47,509
and that anybody who wants to miss a

874
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:51,739
line is probably a bad actor here's an

875
00:39:47,509 --> 00:39:54,650
internet standard protocol stamps by the

876
00:39:51,739 --> 00:39:55,880
IAB and the iesg and other people who

877
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:58,369
should have been grown-ups in the room

878
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,890
that says those people in the middle are

879
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:02,890
just dumb pipes and it doesn't matter

880
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:06,729
what they want or what they don't want I

881
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:11,029
bring this to you because Nanog network

882
00:40:06,729 --> 00:40:13,180
operators group comes from the idea that

883
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:17,089
the Internet is a network of networks

884
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:20,180
and a few of you are from LTE providers

885
00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:24,200
and all of you probably know that most

886
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:27,078
internet growth is now mobile so it's

887
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,019
tiny devices without keyboards that are

888
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:32,630
mobile they will be on Wi-Fi sometimes

889
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:35,029
but they will be on LTE or 4G or

890
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:38,779
whatever most of the time so that's

891
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:41,239
where smart companies are investing but

892
00:40:38,779 --> 00:40:43,819
not investing in people like you who

893
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:45,440
have laptops because they don't think

894
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:47,329
that you're gonna buy very much what

895
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,050
they want is people who have smartphones

896
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:53,760
because there are a lot more of them

897
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:55,710
I tend to be younger and so when I said

898
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,750
elephants were dancing I want to

899
00:40:55,710 --> 00:41:00,420
identify them you've got the advertising

900
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:02,850
industry and then you've got the mobile

901
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:05,850
telephony industry those are the

902
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:08,400
elephants they are after the advertising

903
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:12,690
dollar they want to track one of them

904
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,130
wants the other to be a dumb pipe and if

905
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:17,100
they could leave us out of it if they

906
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:18,560
could let my managed private network not

907
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,880
be affected they would have done it

908
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,320
they've got nothing against me they got

909
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,030
nothing against any of your enterprise

910
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,850
networks you're not statistically

911
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:28,500
speaking going to buy anything so they

912
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:30,960
just don't care but they can't tell the

913
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,490
difference between you and an ISP who

914
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,900
wants to date of mine your dns traffic

915
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:39,479
or a repressive regime who wants to have

916
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,430
thought control over their population so

917
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:48,120
we really are caught in the crossfire

918
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:50,430
here so it's a pretty standard hardball

919
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,650
negotiating tactics to manage some of

920
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:54,720
these choices so that whatever they do

921
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:56,280
they're going to hate but one thing they

922
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,759
will hate maybe less than they hate the

923
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,140
other and then you know you will you win

924
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,160
that round of whatever game you're

925
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:07,230
playing so you do have choices you can

926
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,930
give up on this and just say alright I'm

927
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:12,930
a dumb pipe I'll try and secure my

928
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:17,700
endpoints and I'll deal with the the

929
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:19,589
collateral damage when I can't or you

930
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:22,200
can do what I'm doing which is to

931
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:25,020
remember a time when network operators

932
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,660
were expected to take responsibility for

933
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,860
whatever came out of their network some

934
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,589
of you know I started the first

935
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:34,200
anti-spam company back in the mid-1990s

936
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:37,710
it was called Maps the mail abuse

937
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:39,870
prevention system we created something

938
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:42,330
called the RBL which has since been

939
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:44,279
renamed by wikipedia they call it the

940
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:47,040
real-time block list it is actually the

941
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,530
real-time blackhole list and it was the

942
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,020
first distributed reputation system and

943
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:54,840
when we were getting ready to put some

944
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:56,310
is be on that list such that they would

945
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,560
not be able to send mail to our

946
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:00,690
subscribers they would have inevitably

947
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,140
say that's coming from my customer I

948
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:03,390
have known

949
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:06,900
power to stop them and I would

950
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:09,270
inevitably say if you had a factory on

951
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,740
the river and I lived downriver from you

952
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:13,050
and you were dumping pollution in my

953
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,790
river I would expect you to stop and I

954
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,830
would not care what that took you inside

955
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:21,600
your factory to make it stop and that's

956
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:23,549
the situation we're in but I don't know

957
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:26,480
what I'm gonna tell somebody if they say

958
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:29,340
look it's all do H I can't block that

959
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,000
IAF intends that I not be able to block

960
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:34,860
that so you can no longer hold me as a

961
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,710
network operator responsible for the

962
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:43,680
output of my network that's gonna be a

963
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:45,090
dark day and it's coming so I believe

964
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,120
the other thing that's going to come is

965
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:51,300
a much better home firewall and the

966
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:53,250
folks in Prague yet see Zednik Labs have

967
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:56,040
created the tourist router which is an

968
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:57,990
example of something that has enough

969
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,279
transistors inside of it and a strong

970
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:00,959
enough power supply that you could

971
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,810
expect it to do real things it's not

972
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,360
just a cheap you know ten dollar plastic

973
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:09,420
Linksys it's it's a real device and it

974
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:12,170
costs real money but I am expecting that

975
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:14,700
a lot of homes are going to say

976
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:17,430
everything has to be has to go through

977
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:19,169
an explicit proxy and yes that means

978
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,580
we're strip searching the data on its

979
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,200
way out of the house that's what we have

980
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:24,420
to do to protect ourselves because we

981
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:28,649
can't trust our apps anymore even if

982
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:30,060
they come from nonprofits and I

983
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:32,970
certainly know that the enterprise is

984
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:36,120
gonna have to move that way so what

985
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:39,149
we're gonna end up doing is drastically

986
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:44,210
increasing the complexity of the

987
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:49,380
distributed system and that ends poorly

988
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:52,640
because most increases in queue do not

989
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:55,250
have a corresponding increase in the

990
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,200
numerator we are not adding

991
00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:00,480
understanding nearly as fast as we are

992
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:03,600
adding complexity which means that the

993
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,490
percentage of what we have that we

994
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,520
actually know anything about is going

995
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:11,189
down and now instead of going down in

996
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,320
some linear function where it's just

997
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:14,300
worse year-over-year we're about to have

998
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,600
a step function

999
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:25,040
in in the complexity of this distributed

1000
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:27,200
system so there's an oft-repeated quote

1001
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:31,580
turned out to be wrong

1002
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:35,000
we often hear somebody say that every

1003
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:39,670
man's home is his castle and in it he is

1004
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:44,780
king so this is the actual quote and

1005
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:47,300
that was certainly a big part of kind of

1006
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:50,720
the general sentiment of governments and

1007
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:55,670
Kings and voters and citizens and

1008
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:57,709
whatnot in the 18th century but I have

1009
00:45:55,670 --> 00:46:01,010
to say that if the king wants to use do

1010
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:03,710
H you'll have no choice about that which

1011
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:05,990
means that we are going in the opposite

1012
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:13,090
direction from where we all thought the

1013
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:16,189
internet was going to take us so finally

1014
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:19,040
there is a butterfly effect whatever you

1015
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:22,430
do is going to change the future in some

1016
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,500
way whatever you abstain from doing your

1017
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:26,779
actions have consequences and many of

1018
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,370
those consequences will be tiny and you

1019
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,630
will never know what they were and even

1020
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:31,609
if you were looking for them you

1021
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:34,940
wouldn't be able to determine what they

1022
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:37,430
were and so I'm not asking everybody

1023
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:39,710
whoever builds anything to think about

1024
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:41,480
all of the downstream butterfly effects

1025
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:44,210
that could come from their actions or

1026
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,610
inactions or choices but what I would

1027
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:49,390
like to do is to get more people to

1028
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:52,130
think about that complexity equation and

1029
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:54,230
realize that they have to live and their

1030
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:58,490
families have to grow up in a world that

1031
00:46:54,230 --> 00:47:01,010
they are helping to make and I would

1032
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:03,290
like people to realize that game theory

1033
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:05,180
applies and even if you don't want to

1034
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:07,490
study the math of game theory you should

1035
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:09,470
at least be thinking in terms of okay

1036
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:11,509
I'm gonna make a move we've got a game

1037
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:13,129
board I've got pieces other people have

1038
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:15,590
got pieces I'm gonna make a move and

1039
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:17,030
after I do other people are going to

1040
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:19,160
make a move and then we'll have a new

1041
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:21,920
new game different board everything will

1042
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,040
be different how do I like that compared

1043
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,520
to other moves I'm

1044
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:29,160
make right and I'm not asking people to

1045
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,750
think 10 moves ahead but the people who

1046
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:35,100
are doing this didn't even think two

1047
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:39,330
moves ahead and that just seems crazy

1048
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:41,279
and I've given older smaller versions of

1049
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:43,080
this talk in places that cannot afford

1050
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,730
to put people on airplanes to come to

1051
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:47,460
this meeting or an IETF being or

1052
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:49,020
whatever from their point of view all of

1053
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,420
their choices are being driven by a

1054
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:53,490
bunch of rich young Silicon Valley

1055
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,470
20-somethings who don't have much

1056
00:47:53,490 --> 00:48:00,500
experience with history or philosophy

1057
00:47:55,470 --> 00:48:02,580
and you know they take what they get

1058
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:05,400
they're not they don't have a seat at

1059
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:12,210
the table we should be thinking a little

1060
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:13,410
bit on their behalf so this future is

1061
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:18,030
brutal

1062
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:19,649
we're code is law where if you have the

1063
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:23,280
ability to change the way the

1064
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:25,920
distributed system works then you are in

1065
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,280
that moment the president of the

1066
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,170
internet and if anybody else doesn't

1067
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,850
like what you did they have to write

1068
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:38,760
their own code and see if they could get

1069
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:42,900
it out there okay this ends in tears

1070
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:46,170
this ends in the Mad Max movies I would

1071
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:48,660
I would like us to find a way to seek a

1072
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:55,680
little bit of consensus and stay away

1073
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:57,629
from some of the controversy so I do not

1074
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:01,859
believe that we're in a post national

1075
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:05,550
phase of human history Westphalia era is

1076
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:08,670
certainly partly over because it did not

1077
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:10,170
think the on land and sea and so the

1078
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:14,570
definition of a nation has been

1079
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:18,690
obsoleted three times by air space and

1080
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:22,140
information but I still think that we

1081
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:23,970
need to give nations a role in our

1082
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:26,400
future and that should not involve

1083
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:28,230
Nations writing code nor should it

1084
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,700
involved them forbidding us to write

1085
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:36,310
code I think that there is a

1086
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:37,930
constructive future that we could pick

1087
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:41,020
that is not this one and is known as

1088
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:45,089
brutal because you can only keep what

1089
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:48,190
you can defend has she never ended well

1090
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:49,750
the that's just part of a ticket a talk

1091
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:53,370
and the talk is even more brutal than

1092
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:56,860
the tick and the fact that some

1093
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:59,620
corporations now have IT supremacy over

1094
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:02,200
most nations should concern us because

1095
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:05,380
we don't know either is a voting public

1096
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:09,939
or as just a bunch of people on a ball

1097
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:13,780
of mud how to live that way and we're

1098
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:15,370
going to have to seek accommodation and

1099
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:18,850
I don't think that this is the first

1100
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:20,470
step toward accommodation thank you very

1101
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:22,799
much for inviting me this has been quite

1102
00:50:20,470 --> 00:50:22,799
the owner

1103
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:37,549
[Applause]

1104
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:46,550
should I take any questions

1105
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:46,550
microphones are open Center money

1106
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:02,120
try the one behind you

1107
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:07,470
I can also repeat the question

1108
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:29,759
in the Newberry

1109
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,580
you know

1110
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,840
taters

1111
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:46,130
Oh

1112
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:57,210
yeah this is Tony Talbert from Comcast

1113
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:00,029
and he notes that the complexity and the

1114
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:04,320
cost make the idea of a home firewall

1115
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:07,380
unlikely and that the fact that most new

1116
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,940
growth is in mobile devices that are not

1117
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:13,170
using home networks means that it would

1118
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:15,630
be irrelevance in any case I think we

1119
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:18,150
could probably agree that this is going

1120
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:20,040
to be ugly but a lot of money will be

1121
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:24,690
spent and probably more things will be

1122
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:26,580
broken than fixed but I am expecting

1123
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:30,420
even though it will be done badly I am

1124
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:36,590
expecting it to be done and certainly

1125
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:36,590
with my aunt held I have the ability to

1126
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:44,190
put it in put it behind a firewall by

1127
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:46,230
making it speak I P and bringing a

1128
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:48,570
little LTE to IPE

1129
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:50,460
converter that it has to talk to that I

1130
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:53,580
have the source code to so I'm not sure

1131
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:55,710
exactly how crazy this is all going to

1132
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:57,930
get but I will tell you that we are

1133
00:52:55,710 --> 00:53:02,340
trending in that direction right now

1134
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:05,190
your Smart TV takes a census of 32

1135
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:08,370
pixels of your television screen every

1136
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:11,880
second and so it generates one long word

1137
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:14,910
per second of telemetry and those 32

1138
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,220
pixels uniquely identify what you were

1139
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:19,589
watching at that moment so anybody who

1140
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:23,640
receives a copy of that 32 pixels per

1141
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:25,350
second feed is able to do exactly what

1142
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,589
they need to do in terms of optimizing

1143
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:31,620
their advertising and so on these Smart

1144
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:35,370
TV makers are generally not going to be

1145
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:38,220
profitable based only on the one-time

1146
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:40,650
cost of selling you the TV if they don't

1147
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:42,810
have your PII they will go out of

1148
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:45,090
business and their assets will be bought

1149
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:46,650
after the bankruptcy by smart TV

1150
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:48,660
companies who did take your personal

1151
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:50,640
information that's the world we're

1152
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:52,170
headed toward and it's Darwinian in

1153
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,210
nature we don't have a lot of choices

1154
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:57,660
about whether we're headed there but we

1155
00:53:54,210 --> 00:54:00,980
have our choices about whether some of

1156
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,980
us just say no

1157
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:09,310
hello no it works i Patrick Gilmore

1158
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:11,290
attrex speaking for myself the thing

1159
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:13,270
that always worked for me back in the

1160
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:16,810
90s and early 2000s was enlightened

1161
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:17,920
self-interest louder I worried about you

1162
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:19,930
know some of these things happen but

1163
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,550
when I talk to other ISPs they didn't

1164
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:23,529
want it to happen for their own reasons

1165
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:26,110
but when I talked to people at certain

1166
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:29,590
companies they seem to think it's okay

1167
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:31,360
to like take all this information could

1168
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:33,520
we help solve this problem by for

1169
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:35,020
instance educating the would you call

1170
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,420
them the rich twenty year olds who don't

1171
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:39,400
seem to understand that doing this is

1172
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:40,800
bad for themselves as well as the rest

1173
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,270
of society

1174
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,890
so Patrick you and I may not have been

1175
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:47,620
rich but we were twenty year olds

1176
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:49,600
together and I don't think that we were

1177
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:51,880
examples of somebody that could have

1178
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:54,400
been told anything so I'm sure that the

1179
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:56,890
same as true now as was true of us which

1180
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,480
is that every generation thinks that

1181
00:54:56,890 --> 00:54:59,950
they invented sex and a bunch of other

1182
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:04,030
stuff and they're gonna come to their

1183
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:06,399
own conclusions in their own way the

1184
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:08,730
thing that is concerning is actually not

1185
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:12,010
what the young 20-somethings are doing

1186
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:15,310
it's that nation-state networks and some

1187
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:17,770
ISP networks are not private they are

1188
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:19,840
some form of public network even if

1189
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:22,210
they're not regulated but they want the

1190
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:26,470
rights that private networks would have

1191
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:30,520
to look at traffic and perturb some of

1192
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:35,770
that traffic and as long as those as

1193
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:37,900
long as ISPs and national firewalls try

1194
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:39,210
to have the rights of managed private

1195
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,860
networks we're going to see technology

1196
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:46,830
that makes it harder for managed private

1197
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:49,660
networks I and I certainly know that

1198
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:51,520
China for example is not waiting to hear

1199
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:55,870
my opinion about how they ought to run

1200
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:59,430
their network so I I think there's no

1201
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:59,430
way to get these elephants off the field

1202
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,350
hi dr. Pixy I'm Scott Johnson from solar

1203
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,970
net one considering the issue of a

1204
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:13,980
mobile device which is essentially

1205
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:17,700
multihomed in many instances in these

1206
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:19,820
days would we not be able to resolve

1207
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:23,100
many of these problems if we moved the

1208
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:26,700
name resolution back to the client and

1209
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:30,450
run bind or a smaller version thereof on

1210
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:34,830
every client paisa so believe it or not

1211
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:36,779
I've looked into that the apps that are

1212
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:40,620
being put out there by companies like

1213
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:43,020
Open DNS or CloudFlare in order to get

1214
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:47,450
your DNS from your smart device to go to

1215
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:52,200
their cloud instead of to your ISP our

1216
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:55,470
Trojans they are masquerading as VPN

1217
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:58,379
applications and Apple and Google for

1218
00:56:55,470 --> 00:57:02,459
Android are permitting this type of

1219
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:05,130
thing as a type of VPN application what

1220
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:06,330
that means is that the device what that

1221
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:09,450
piece of software is doing is looking

1222
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:11,009
for DNS queries and grabbing them and if

1223
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:15,720
it's not a DNS query then it just gets

1224
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:18,750
sent not over the tunnel and I'm

1225
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:21,330
expecting that loophole to be closed I'm

1226
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:23,010
expecting handset makers either because

1227
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:24,660
the networks forced them to do it or

1228
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:27,030
because they themselves are also with

1229
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:30,049
the advertising business are gonna say

1230
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:34,860
we don't want to allow that anymore so

1231
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:37,290
as much as I would love to run Unbound

1232
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:38,640
or bind or something on my smart phone I

1233
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:41,550
mean my smartphone has got more

1234
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:44,490
transistors in it then all of deck comm

1235
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:46,140
had when I worked there in 1990 and so I

1236
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:47,970
know that it could run a name server

1237
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:51,330
that's not a hard problem for something

1238
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:54,359
that powerful but it's we are not in a

1239
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:57,180
permissionless innovation situation

1240
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:59,880
anymore these choices will be managed

1241
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:03,330
for us by monopolists whose interests

1242
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,920
are not aligned with ours as a follow-up

1243
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:07,880
what is your opinion on how we take that

1244
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,880
permission back for ourselves

1245
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:23,230
so there's a there's a lot of overlap

1246
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:25,780
between people who are sort of

1247
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:28,600
libertarian in nature and people who

1248
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:30,970
develop internet technology so the idea

1249
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:33,160
of regulation is often laughed out of

1250
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:35,799
the room when you're talking to people

1251
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,810
who have come of age in what was a

1252
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:44,140
permissionless innovation district

1253
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:47,250
situation so I think the fix for this is

1254
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:51,069
going to have to come in the form of

1255
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:53,680
laws like GDP are right some of the

1256
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:57,070
abuses I've described to you today would

1257
00:58:53,680 --> 00:59:00,549
already be illegal in Europe and I don't

1258
00:58:57,070 --> 00:59:03,370
expect Mozilla for example to turn on do

1259
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:05,710
H anywhere in the GDP our land because I

1260
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:08,500
you know I've read gdpr and it says you

1261
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:10,870
can't do stuff like that without

1262
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:13,210
explicit case-by-case permission which

1263
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:18,720
mozilla is in no position to seek and is

1264
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:23,230
not seeking today so I think we need to

1265
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:24,600
wait for the talk right now we're far to

1266
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:27,160
the populists

1267
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,860
small to non-existent government style

1268
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:32,620
and we need to get back to the point

1269
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:34,840
where responsible governance is not

1270
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:37,420
laughable and that we're willing to try

1271
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:40,240
it I know that Senator Wyden from Oregon

1272
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:42,130
is trying very hard to introduce some

1273
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:45,479
privacy legislation here that would

1274
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:51,490
begin to get parody with gdpr

1275
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:54,580
but if the tea party continues to be the

1276
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:56,950
the single party in control of all

1277
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:59,620
branches of government we're not going

1278
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:01,540
to get far with that so at the moment

1279
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:03,730
the time is simply wrong to try and make

1280
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:07,290
this better but what it's ultimately

1281
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:07,290
going to look like as GDP our

1282
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:16,740
robbed crunk from Ball State University

1283
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:18,450
my question first off I want to preface

1284
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:22,288
I really appreciate your philosophical

1285
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:25,049
points in the presentation my question

1286
01:00:22,289 --> 01:00:28,200
to you is how far are we from DNS and

1287
01:00:25,049 --> 01:00:31,589
these connections owned by these ISPs

1288
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:33,509
from being used as political tools so

1289
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:36,058
I've liked your point about the West

1290
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:37,920
Indian trading company arguably they'd

1291
01:00:36,059 --> 01:00:39,869
be at a certain point in history they

1292
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:42,990
became larger than the English

1293
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:45,119
government how far off are we from

1294
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:47,038
having these ISPs effectively become

1295
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:51,299
bigger than the governments that are

1296
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:56,130
meant to manage them well depending on

1297
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:58,650
how you measure we're already there but

1298
01:00:56,130 --> 01:01:01,470
if you're asking sort of when will this

1299
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:04,170
be obvious to the man on the street was

1300
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:08,520
a great 1974 movie with James Caan

1301
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:12,619
called rollerball that is worth looking

1302
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:20,759
up on Netflix or YouTube or whatever I

1303
01:01:12,619 --> 01:01:24,690
think Carol cot Waller did a short piece

1304
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:27,150
on how brexit was tipped using Cambridge

1305
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:30,450
analytic a lot of people have done

1306
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:33,329
similar bits on how the Trump campaign

1307
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:36,270
was tipped using Cambridge analytic so

1308
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:39,029
the fact that a company who is

1309
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:43,319
effectively unregulated with regard to

1310
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:46,490
this type of behavior is already having

1311
01:01:43,319 --> 01:01:50,520
such an outsized impact on world events

1312
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:52,919
is knowable by anyone who cares to know

1313
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:55,440
it the ax data is available then the

1314
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:57,690
articles are available anybody who is

1315
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:00,240
not predisposed to think of that as fake

1316
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:02,700
news is capable of knowing that we're

1317
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:05,939
already well on our way to corporations

1318
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:08,460
having more power than nations and

1319
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:10,650
waiting for those people to wake up it

1320
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:14,789
seems hopeless but it's the best I've

1321
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:17,849
got and a follow-up question so

1322
01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:21,299
harkening back to how dns is moving

1323
01:02:17,849 --> 01:02:23,780
towards kind of a single point for

1324
01:02:21,299 --> 01:02:26,670
example Google's eight

1325
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:30,900
what would happen say if Google just

1326
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:32,490
absolutely refuses to I don't know let's

1327
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,290
say Ball State did something Google

1328
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:35,939
didn't appreciate with and they just

1329
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:37,710
decide to completely remove our domain

1330
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:40,910
from their name server and just refuse

1331
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:43,110
to host any connections like that how

1332
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:45,660
what's stopping them from doing that is

1333
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:48,780
there anything that we can do to work

1334
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:50,240
around that or just your thoughts on the

1335
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:54,390
matter

1336
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:58,410
well I think we all know because we know

1337
01:02:54,390 --> 01:03:01,920
how DDoS works that any angry 13 year

1338
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:04,170
old can bring down anything on the

1339
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:07,790
internet if they get angry

1340
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:10,530
this whole thing as a house of cards and

1341
01:03:07,790 --> 01:03:12,270
the reason they don't is because there's

1342
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:14,010
no money to be made doing that you need

1343
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:16,200
the internet to be up so that you can

1344
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:18,840
reach your victims and that's why the

1345
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:20,220
internet stays up it's not because the

1346
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:24,150
bad guys couldn't bring it down if they

1347
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:26,009
wanted to and I think that's Google's

1348
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:28,530
position also they've never filtered

1349
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:30,570
anything in 8.8 that's what they that's

1350
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:34,350
their superpower according to them is

1351
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:35,880
that 9.9 and OpenDNS both have long

1352
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:38,940
lists of things they won't return

1353
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:40,740
correct answers to because a dns is a

1354
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:44,760
good control point for cyber security

1355
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:46,140
but 1.1 does not filter anything and 8.8

1356
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,390
does not filter anything and I think

1357
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:49,830
that the first time they decided to

1358
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:51,900
filter anything that would cause

1359
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:53,490
shockwaves through the set of people who

1360
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:57,450
only trust them because they don't act

1361
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:59,939
that way but in terms of your recourse

1362
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:05,730
rather than their deterrent if they were

1363
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:10,230
to do that you would have to seek remedy

1364
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:13,800
in civil court probably something out of

1365
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:15,840
the Sherman Antitrust Act but it would

1366
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:18,870
be very hard because you are small and

1367
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:20,370
they are large and a couple of years of

1368
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:22,109
discovery will pretty much eat up

1369
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:24,420
whatever budget you thought you had for

1370
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:29,240
a lawsuit but it won't stop somebody as

1371
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:29,240
large as Google thank you

1372
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:35,940
hi admins reek of manic personal

1373
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:38,830
capacity well you're on genisphere

1374
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:41,110
tupled main operator in Ukraine and I

1375
01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:43,000
mean I remember these things twenty

1376
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:45,340
thirty years ago when as Microsoft and

1377
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,230
closed a source in responded resorption

1378
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:49,450
source well you know I have this little

1379
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:51,010
Sony Xperia phone that can run selfish

1380
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:53,710
vests these are same people that left

1381
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:55,510
Nokia you know and start off their Linux

1382
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:57,490
based operating system and I think it

1383
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:59,830
can still possible I maybe I should try

1384
01:04:57,490 --> 01:05:01,660
to package unbound is a thing that is

1385
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:03,430
similar to quad one application and it

1386
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:05,109
would do the same VPN thing right it's

1387
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:06,839
allowed right and you can send you

1388
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:09,070
curious and then you can run your own

1389
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:12,430
instance in the cloud and send this

1390
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:14,500
curious to your own ok binder and HD in

1391
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:16,240
the cloud and so forth so what's

1392
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:18,280
stopping anybody from doing that I know

1393
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:20,259
it's not very profitable but just like

1394
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:22,690
dr. go leaves off without advertising

1395
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:24,310
and I'm a user of them too I mean I

1396
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:26,590
don't see the hope I mean I waiting for

1397
01:05:24,310 --> 01:05:30,910
episode five of course what do you think

1398
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:32,650
I think that if something is going to be

1399
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:36,700
done it will be because it either makes

1400
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:39,340
money or saves money for somebody and

1401
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:41,259
I've been advising folks you know you

1402
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:43,330
didn't need to move your recursive name

1403
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:45,070
server to the ISP you could have kept

1404
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:46,840
that on your campus could put that in

1405
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:49,060
your house there's a device out there

1406
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,050
called the pie hole which is based on

1407
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:52,900
the Raspberry Pi

1408
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:56,590
it's a Linux image that acts as a DNS

1409
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:59,320
server but I got to say you should

1410
01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:02,560
imagine your parents receiving one of

1411
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:04,450
these and they got to find a way to get

1412
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:06,910
it plugged into the Wi-Fi network

1413
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:09,040
they've got to get into the DSL gateway

1414
01:06:06,910 --> 01:06:12,009
or whatever that is cable modem box and

1415
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:15,370
set up a route to make sure that that

1416
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:17,530
box has a known address and they've got

1417
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:21,609
to set up the DHCP server to assign that

1418
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:22,990
address and I think you can imagine that

1419
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:25,180
your parents are not going to do that

1420
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:26,649
and that you don't want to go do it for

1421
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:29,799
them because then every time it breaks

1422
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:31,480
they're going to call you so the reason

1423
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:33,460
that we're moving things further and

1424
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:35,650
further from where the questions enter

1425
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:38,170
is because there's money to be made

1426
01:06:35,650 --> 01:06:40,600
doing that and until there's money to be

1427
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:41,809
made or saved by bringing it back into

1428
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,180
something close

1429
01:06:41,809 --> 01:06:45,769
you it's not gonna happen yeah I mean

1430
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:47,359
just like its profitable to sell people

1431
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:49,218
sugary drinks and then treat them for

1432
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:50,839
Betty it's profitable to sell people

1433
01:06:49,219 --> 01:06:52,489
things that violate their privacy and

1434
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:56,949
then sell them privacy protection tools

1435
01:06:52,489 --> 01:06:58,279
right okay but it's a big discussion

1436
01:06:56,949 --> 01:07:00,259
thank you

1437
01:06:58,279 --> 01:07:01,939
if there are no more questions I will

1438
01:07:00,259 --> 01:07:03,150
serve into the stage thank you again for

1439
01:07:01,939 --> 01:07:14,519
inviting me

1440
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:14,519
[Applause]

1441
01:07:20,549 --> 01:07:22,609
you
