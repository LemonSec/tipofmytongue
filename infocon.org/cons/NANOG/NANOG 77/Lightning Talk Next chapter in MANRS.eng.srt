1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:17,540
thank you everyone my

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:22,279
Society excuse me and to do here I'm

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:24,349
talked about working progress that could

4
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:28,040
be a next chapter in the community

5
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:31,160
project called manners well before I

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,899
start I probably need to set the context

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,180
and explain a little bit what Manas is

8
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:37,309
and I wonder how many people in the room

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:41,230
know or heard about Manas about this

10
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:43,699
initiative quite a few so that

11
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:46,790
simplifies my work basically what

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,920
manners is is it's a baseline

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,920
it's a baseline that we try to promote

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,620
to be a new Munim in routing operations

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,950
which consists of four eyes piece for

16
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:00,290
instance for simple actions that is

17
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,660
peers that join this effort are required

18
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:04,938
to implement and it's also community

19
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,590
because any effort that you try to sort

20
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:10,179
of progress and especially in the norm

21
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:12,979
space is as strong as as the community

22
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:16,189
that suppose that so that's that's

23
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:17,929
basically - in a nutshell but you can go

24
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:19,669
to the website and learn more about the

25
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:23,030
actions and what is required to join

26
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:26,060
this but just a stress this is not a

27
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,950
declaration or statement and this is not

28
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,530
a code of conduct that's really an

29
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,030
actionable thing that network operators

30
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:35,570
are required to demonstrate the

31
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:37,549
implementation before they can join so

32
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:40,460
those are the four actions that we

33
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:42,979
developed five years ago when these

34
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,169
initiatives started and in and in

35
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:46,960
society role here is the Secretariat but

36
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,250
really that's a industry initiative

37
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,619
Network co-operators started this and

38
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:55,880
the co-operators continued to run this

39
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:56,960
initiative four major actions very tight

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,939
in scope

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,009
they basically say clean up your side of

42
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:02,990
the street they are not best current

43
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,549
practices their minimum current

44
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,649
practices that I distilled from best

45
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,629
current practices but that's sort of the

46
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,729
bar not too low and not too high at the

47
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:14,329
same time that can potential to become

48
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:16,189
known but once we launch this initiative

49
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,200
soon after we realize that other

50
00:02:16,189 --> 00:02:20,359
entities that can also very much

51
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,700
contribute to improving routing security

52
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,499
one of them is internet exchange points

53
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,299
they have local communities who is

54
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:27,760
common opera

55
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,370
an objective right they have potential

56
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,590
to actually introduce some high hygiene

57
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,800
in the environment they operate which

58
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:38,980
resulted in the work which will cool the

59
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,410
manners IXP program and first we thought

60
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,649
well why don't I just join manners and

61
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:48,460
comply to those four actions point I

62
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:51,580
action point I demonstrated before but

63
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,860
soon discussing this we realize that no

64
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,350
they have specific needs and they have

65
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,090
specific ways to be more effective you

66
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,970
know and it talks about routing security

67
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:03,430
and in particular I Experian route

68
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,770
server can enforce a high level of

69
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,570
routing hygiene not allowing incorrect

70
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,810
routing announcement propagating through

71
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,459
this proxy right for instance and they

72
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,620
also have high potential to promote

73
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,920
medicine and high norms of routing

74
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,780
hygiene among our membership so those

75
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,119
two actions they are mandatory when you

76
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,550
when an internet exchange point wants to

77
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:30,570
join this initiative and they they are

78
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:30,570
looking after that so as time goes by

79
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:38,250
excuse me

80
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:41,170
yeah as time went by we thought well

81
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:44,200
that's great we have our SPS we have

82
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:47,230
IXPs the also significant entities

83
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,899
operating on the internet called CDN

84
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,880
providers all Club providers and we're

85
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,260
thinking are they just networks are they

86
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,709
just stop maybe networks

87
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,510
oh they something bigger and the impact

88
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,090
on rousing and the bigger as well and

89
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,560
one of the idea was probably they're

90
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,730
bigger probably they are slightly

91
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,200
different and probably they have

92
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,570
different requirements and ways to

93
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,630
contribute the routing security one of

94
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,950
the thing is they have enormous

95
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,989
appearing power and if we can leverage

96
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,298
this being power because people want to

97
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:18,190
pay with CD ends people want to pay with

98
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:21,789
cloud providers maybe we can leverage

99
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:24,580
this in providing security as well so we

100
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:27,370
got together and we use the approach

101
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:31,750
that we used in initial manners and then

102
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,910
in the isp program erase this idea and

103
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,520
if it passes the law of test go further

104
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,080
set up a group of volunteers a task

105
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,688
force develop a set of you

106
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,818
useful requirements who call actions and

107
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:45,979
then solicit feedback from a wider

108
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:49,460
community that's where we are now

109
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:51,530
I'm here to solicit this feedback then

110
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,659
finalize the action set and launch and

111
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,549
launch by lunch we mean not just you

112
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:57,800
know declare this in a website but have

113
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,870
a group of CDN and cloud providers that

114
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,810
implement those actions and can

115
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,969
demonstrate that that can be done so

116
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,159
what are those actions and this is a

117
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:10,879
gain walk in progress we are soliciting

118
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:13,580
feedback on that we came up with six

119
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,889
actions which is subject to change of

120
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,659
course it's not final and the first one

121
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:20,240
is probably one of most important ones

122
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:23,449
if you're a CDN a cloud provider you

123
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,440
enforce filtering Whitely is filtering

124
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:28,699
for your non transit peers meaning if

125
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,659
you want to appear with a cloud provider

126
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:35,930
CDN you better register your browse for

127
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:38,840
instance in in RPG io IRR and filters

128
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:42,529
will be built that will not allow any

129
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,479
other announcements coming from you all

130
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:48,949
the same action is very similar to ISP

131
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,870
action which says do not o prevent any

132
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:53,930
spoof

133
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,510
any any traffic with spoofed source IP

134
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:58,220
addresses leaving your network which

135
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,770
probably not a big problem for CD ends

136
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,870
that have very much control over their

137
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,448
infrastructure for cloud providers might

138
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:08,650
be more challenging but that's again the

139
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:10,340
purpose of having this action in place

140
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,229
coordination coordination and

141
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,760
communication that's basically what it

142
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:16,250
talks about having your contact

143
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,180
information open being able to be

144
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:23,330
contacted and be responsive action for

145
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:25,400
again very similar to what ISPs are

146
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,200
doing and that's called facilitate

147
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,900
validation of routing information on

148
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,750
global scale the thing is as you know

149
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,780
that that task strongly depends on the

150
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:38,810
quality of data of routing repository

151
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,750
speed internet routing registry or an

152
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:44,240
rpki system if this data is incomplete

153
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,100
that's how far you can go with global

154
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,310
validation right and you probably

155
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,720
remember that when rpki took off there

156
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,270
were some problems with quality of that

157
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,889
data as well and people are reluctant to

158
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,289
use that but now people are quite

159
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:59,120
comfortable for instance using rpki to

160
00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:01,250
drop invalid routes

161
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,440
so if rpki invalid some of the

162
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,960
announcements people trust this data are

163
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,580
well enough to drop that so this quality

164
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:12,789
is raising and that's essential in in in

165
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:15,349
enabling validation on the global scale

166
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:16,729
of course action 5 that's one of the

167
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:19,700
purpose of the exercise is that you

168
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:21,229
encourage - adoption and cloud and CDN

169
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,360
providers have a lot of peers they have

170
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:25,750
their not our own network of of those

171
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,900
connections and if they use this to

172
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:32,090
encourage their peers to implement

173
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,190
manners that would be great and in fact

174
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:38,090
this is a win-win situation because if

175
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:41,750
you only protect your sort of your

176
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:43,940
border with non transit peers bad

177
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:46,550
announcements will get to you anyway for

178
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,590
instance through your transit provider

179
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,750
so if your peers actually implement

180
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,580
manners that guarantees that those

181
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,020
announcements will not leave they will

182
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,550
not pollute the routing system with

183
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,639
those announcements and you will not

184
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,530
receive them and action for which is not

185
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,360
mandatory and again we have some

186
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,489
discussion whether it's useful or not is

187
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,680
to provide some monitoring debugging

188
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,750
the peering partners for instance if you

189
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,580
implement this white whitelist filtering

190
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,740
and that's what we also experience with

191
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,000
internet exchange points one thing is

192
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,980
that you drop something on the floor

193
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,410
another thing that might be also very

194
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:21,590
helpful if you provide some mechanism to

195
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:23,540
appears to be aware that some of the

196
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:27,640
announcements that they generated are

197
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:30,410
actually dropped so this is action for

198
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,179
now this is the task force that people

199
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:35,210
that contributed to the section set and

200
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:39,650
we had some discussions and calls and

201
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:46,100
meetings so I'm very grateful for for

202
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:49,040
them to participate in this work this is

203
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,770
this set where you can look at the full

204
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,540
description not and this brief lightning

205
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:57,079
talk but the full description of those

206
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:59,959
action set and if you see the end of

207
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,900
cloud provide your feedback enormously

208
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,130
important if your network cooperate it's

209
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,260
also very important because you're

210
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:10,730
dealing with those entities to see how

211
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:12,860
effective those actions could be we set

212
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:16,640
up a small survey so this is a QR code

213
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:18,530
and this is URL for this survey it

214
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,810
basically just to get some room

215
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,850
temperature on what you feel about those

216
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,530
actions are they useful are they not

217
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,780
do you agree with the wording or you

218
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:29,810
would prefer another one that feedback

219
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:34,550
would be very helpful in moving this

220
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:35,900
project further towards the launch so

221
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:42,229
please take your time it's it's very

222
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:43,640
simple survey multiple choice and I

223
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,230
think with that that ends my

224
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,250
presentation I'm happy to take any

225
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,250
questions if they are

226
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:06,640
all right well thank you very much

227
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:06,640
[Applause]

228
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,479
you
