1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,620
hello ladies and gentlemen my name is

2
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:18,119
Alexandra ribbon and today we'll be

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:21,279
talking about impress in data centers

4
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:25,270
just before we get started just a few

5
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,060
words about about Yandex so what is it

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:31,210
the annex is the biggest IT company in

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:34,839
Russia and one of the biggest largest IT

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:37,840
companies in Europe so the annex is the

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:41,020
huge digital ecosystem of consumer

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,820
services the services like Alex George

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,090
which is the which is the leading search

12
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,950
engine in Russia I mean with with the

13
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,050
leading market share

14
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,820
there are also services like an extract

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,059
which is the largest context of the

16
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:58,750
TASMAC network in Russia there are also

17
00:00:55,059 --> 00:01:01,769
services like ionic taxi car sharing

18
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:04,000
food delivery just name a few and

19
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,390
recently Yandex has launched a new

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,680
service annex public cloud where we're

21
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:14,229
in I'm in charge of network

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:17,020
infrastructure so in Palace and data

23
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:18,910
centers in Palace in other cells I know

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,789
that sounds slightly untypical

25
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,890
and extraordinary and I'm kind of

26
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:25,360
feeling that for those of you who have

27
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,789
ever build data center networks or

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,000
operated them in possession data centers

29
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:34,780
more likely sounds weird or or even

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,970
insane and why is that that's probably

31
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:41,020
because Impa less is perceived to

32
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:44,470
something which pursuits like something

33
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:47,050
from service providers like central

34
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:51,640
complex and and indeed all that stuff

35
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:54,580
like a GP + LDP there I'm sure you know

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,739
the problems with synchronization and of

37
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,929
course RSVP on top of it for traffic

38
00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:02,619
engineering all of that is slightly

39
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:04,630
complicated and given us that the

40
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:06,340
question is who might be that crazy to

41
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:10,508
want to bring compress into data center

42
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:13,030
networks and yeah well the reason I'm

43
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:15,910
here today is to show you that in place

44
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,530
and data centers can have nothing in

45
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,109
common with complexity and be an elegant

46
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,570
solution on the contrary the solution to

47
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:25,470
many differences in

48
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:28,560
and and that in Peleus in can make

49
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:31,040
things easier or more manageable to want

50
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,040
a better world

51
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,560
so let's take a look

52
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,940
button yes let's take a look at this

53
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,930
slide there is a typical data center

54
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,810
network depicted it has close topology

55
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:52,170
or excuse me according to us wide it has

56
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:53,760
claw topology but yeah anyway it has it

57
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,660
consists of several layers like leaf

58
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,060
lettuce wine level and an export that's

59
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,240
what our data center fabric network look

60
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,520
like looks like in the data center

61
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,620
network we have the different protocols

62
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,360
we have AP before for the Overland

63
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,620
Network and the primary usage or the

64
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,420
overall network is to provide our

65
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,750
customers with their own virtual

66
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,149
networks where they can run virtual

67
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:21,660
machines and so on so forth we also have

68
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:24,420
ipv6 for our core cloud components so

69
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,190
basically every core cloud service like

70
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,149
metro block storage object storage

71
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,700
databases any service uses ipv6 and by

72
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:39,300
the way the bottoms of ipv6 traffic

73
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:41,339
exceeds those of AP before and of course

74
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,860
we've gotten palace which is the topic

75
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,140
for a discussion it is also worth

76
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,880
noticing that in the data stand the

77
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,929
fabric we use on the commodity network

78
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,670
years by commodity network years I mean

79
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,570
general typical layer 3 switches based

80
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:59,910
on tomahawk or Trident chipsets basics

81
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,440
so let's finally take a look at the

82
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,299
first implies neighbor scenario I mean

83
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,300
the scenario where we fully employed in

84
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:10,680
place it's delivering packets to the

85
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:12,360
Internet and and back so when a client's

86
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,860
virtual machine sends a packet to the

87
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,160
Internet the packet passes the overlay

88
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,590
Network and enters cloud it way cloud

89
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,790
gateway is the special network appliance

90
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:23,880
which bridges the gap between the

91
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,480
overlay and underlying networks cloud

92
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,700
gateway

93
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,550
receiving the packet received the packet

94
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,919
and with with the help of route of route

95
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,650
reflect knows what a particular border

96
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,960
routers it needs to send the packet to

97
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,210
so it imposes

98
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,849
transport label and send the packet to

99
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,400
the fabric fabric I mean those commodity

100
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:47,000
natural gears performed trigger smoke

101
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,770
operation until the packet enters until

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,140
the packet gets the edge of the data

103
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,760
center network at the edge an additional

104
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,880
transport level imposed in order to send

105
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,920
the packet over the backbone and that

106
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,170
packet with two levels and post level

107
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,590
packet travels the bevel network and few

108
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:04,670
hops before butter router all those

109
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,619
transport levels get stripped and the

110
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:08,870
purity packet is sent to the internet

111
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,210
through the butter router the reverse

112
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,660
path is pretty the same it's simple as

113
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,229
that

114
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:19,100
however let me shed some light on on the

115
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:21,470
detail details well just remind you that

116
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,180
in Peleus is not complex as long as you

117
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,560
don't bring those protocols in your

118
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,470
network especially in data center

119
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,050
network so we didn't either instead we

120
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,700
use on the BGP and BGP level and cast in

121
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,910
particular to carry level billing

122
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:37,820
information then network appliance we

123
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:40,370
use the already mentioned cloud gateway

124
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,909
is our internal development it's a key

125
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:47,120
component of cloud network ecosystem let

126
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,160
me say so and and it is based on EDI

127
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,160
your vector packet processor for data

128
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,430
plane and go bgp for contra plain we

129
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,970
also have load balancers which just

130
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,720
another type of cloud gateway based

131
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,330
based on cloud between

132
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,370
we also have very large reflectors

133
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,849
throughout injectors filter noise

134
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,290
management nodes and so on

135
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:12,350
cloud connector cloud connector is

136
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:14,360
another key component of our network as

137
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,430
you can guess cloud connector connect

138
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,400
the data center network to the backbone

139
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,830
network on the backbone side it has a

140
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,630
GPL dps appear all that stuff on the

141
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,270
back when a drug has on the bgp level

142
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,040
unicast so cloud connector is that

143
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,750
device which imposes an additional trust

144
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,850
level in order to send packet over the

145
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:35,990
back one

146
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:37,970
well cloud connector is is the same

147
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,100
commodity not forgive so the same layer

148
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:43,910
3 switches the layer of the switch we

149
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,590
use everywhere in our network couple

150
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,810
words about the backbone network so

151
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,820
that's a typical region depicted our

152
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,710
backbone Network intercom

153
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,719
availability zones and points of

154
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,669
presence it will build two zones our

155
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,290
data center Skousen thousand sellers and

156
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,390
points of presence that special

157
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:03,470
technical sides with the only network

158
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:05,419
that took equipment so through bits of

159
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:09,110
bandwidth minimal latency it's all about

160
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:12,530
the backward Network and now how routing

161
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,950
information is distributed it's it's

162
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:19,489
slightly messy site but yeah I hope I

163
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:21,920
hope it's visible though so what I

164
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,490
wanted you to see is that BGP label

165
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,220
unicast

166
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,860
is used only to distribute label

167
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:30,200
buildings only to look back interfaces

168
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,370
of network appliances those network

169
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,420
appliances which need to communicate

170
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:42,110
with each other every Network appliance

171
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:45,310
establish direct connected external bgp

172
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:50,570
level and concession with fabric device

173
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:53,750
and overall bgp and impalas himself

174
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,940
first a very teeny transport system for

175
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,530
us Tina transfer system over the data

176
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,360
center networks and over the bamboo

177
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:05,450
networks bubble network

178
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:08,030
so after distribution all those after

179
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:11,780
distribution all of loopback stability

180
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,729
information those network appliances and

181
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,340
actually not only network appliances but

182
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:18,350
routers for example so they can set up

183
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:23,710
their own BGP session on top of that

184
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:26,080
transport system and exchange their own

185
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,370
routing information and then send

186
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,109
whatever type of traffic they want it

187
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,020
might be purity before you know people

188
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,800
6n or even impalas

189
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:38,870
so it doesn't it doesn't matter that

190
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:42,199
sort of flexibility which in place gives

191
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,039
us is very appealing what is also

192
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,050
important

193
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,520
that's all keep keeping the network

194
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:51,380
beneath absolute unaware of any of that

195
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,510
moreover the beauty of in polis is that

196
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:58,820
we can seamlessly integrate into the

197
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:02,209
backbone network so it t need data plane

198
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,639
just stack of levels

199
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:08,059
very simple minimalistic contra plane

200
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,730
bgp with minimum minimum amounts of

201
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:14,719
lubricant ounces and very very little

202
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:16,399
state in the network and speaking of

203
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,959
state there is actually no additional

204
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,970
state into the bible network because

205
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:23,089
cloud conductor because of cloud

206
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,970
connector cloud connector with the help

207
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:28,850
of level unicast throughout reflector

208
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:34,220
with record in this case imposes that

209
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:36,679
additional transport levels well I hope

210
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,279
you more or less firmer with the key

211
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:44,629
idea and let me show you some impetus in

212
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:47,179
blessing able scenarios to go on now we

213
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:49,189
can in such cool way delivery package to

214
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:51,079
the Internet and back but that's not

215
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:53,809
enough for our customers they want more

216
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:57,008
and they asked for some sort of disaster

217
00:09:53,809 --> 00:10:00,290
recovery and the best way to do it is to

218
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:02,300
is to deploy groups or machines in every

219
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:04,339
evil build to zone and the regional

220
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,799
level or balance eludes us to distribute

221
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:07,999
to deliver traffic to them the idea is

222
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,470
pretty trivial with the tab load

223
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,959
balancer notes in every evil bill to

224
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,850
zone and those load balancer nodes start

225
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:16,638
and not seen any car through stupid

226
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:21,019
routers then butter routers butter

227
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:22,459
rotors even the distribute imbalance in

228
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:24,740
cannon from the internet traffic over

229
00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:28,309
those it was built zones over load

230
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:30,170
balancer notes and now if a customer

231
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:31,219
solution machine Kapil today one able to

232
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,128
build his own that's not a problem

233
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,170
anymore because law Donna's not just

234
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:39,470
withdraw the asana cast announces and

235
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,179
and that's all so traffic will traffic

236
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:45,879
is distributed to the other

237
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:50,329
availability zones but what what if a

238
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:52,129
loaders no dice that's a problem that's

239
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:55,878
a problem because every load bones not

240
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:58,429
represent represent itself and next up

241
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:04,490
entering in and but routers for those in

242
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:06,470
the cast routes and if butter routers

243
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,720
are not consistent fashion capable and

244
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,600
they're not in our case removing just

245
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,819
one entry oh just one extra entry leads

246
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,819
to all flows to be rehearsed

247
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:22,010
for example TCP sessions get redirected

248
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,490
to the wrong destination and eventually

249
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,730
dropped

250
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:28,460
so the feller only one load Bono's not

251
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,900
in one bill to zone affects all the

252
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,910
traffic or the traffic in the whole

253
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:36,020
region that that's quite a big problem

254
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:37,819
but what can we do about that hopefully

255
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:41,800
like many problems this one can be

256
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:46,790
solved by adding more layers so we

257
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:57,560
basically we just have pre load balancer

258
00:11:46,790 --> 00:12:00,380
so yes moves we put in additional box in

259
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,810
the middle be named at pre load balancer

260
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,670
and these pre load balancers

261
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,949
re-announced roots from load balancer

262
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:09,829
nodes to butter routers and they and now

263
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:13,400
next hope entries in butter outers

264
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:15,410
unlike load balancers which under

265
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,340
development and constantly receive

266
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:23,530
updates sometimes feathers or boots pre

267
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:26,480
load balances stays almost untouched and

268
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:34,400
because they were rarely receive any

269
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:38,320
updates these pre load balancers keeps

270
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:42,980
the next hope list in Albury routers

271
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:45,230
very stable so now what happens in

272
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,240
availability zone a stays in

273
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:50,030
availability to zone 8 so that's not the

274
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,340
straps or the traffic anymore on in the

275
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:54,829
whole region so the other zones are

276
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,600
unaffected and even more a lot balancer

277
00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:02,030
notes I can sisters cache incapable

278
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:04,370
within the region and so even the

279
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:08,680
failure of one able to build of one a

280
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:13,130
lot Don's not in one availability zone

281
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:15,859
never disrupts traffic anymore and now

282
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:19,310
you may ask me how is this all really

283
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:22,100
want to impress and the answer is that

284
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:24,589
because of him police we we were able we

285
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,800
was able to put this provide balance or

286
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,660
not

287
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,630
somewhere in each spot and forget about

288
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,920
them and

289
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:35,410
as does the rest job I mean in place

290
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:39,520
interconnects all those preload balances

291
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:42,069
and load balancers the cool thing is

292
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,449
that we we change entirely nothing

293
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:46,060
called the fabric to support this

294
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:49,810
scenario so this isn't this this problem

295
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:52,569
showed up very just all the sudden and

296
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:57,520
we can can in week was able to quickly

297
00:13:52,570 --> 00:14:00,610
address it well let's take a look on the

298
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,699
next impressionable scenario cloud

299
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,260
market in Russia is still emerging we

300
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:11,410
receive new customer requirements on

301
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:13,480
daily basis and one big customer comes

302
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:16,060
and says that he wants to consume our

303
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,150
cloud services but he has his wrong data

304
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,310
center he has already heavily invested

305
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:25,900
in and therefore has no plans to drop it

306
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:28,750
so basically this client wants a fat pie

307
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:31,060
between his data center and cloud yeah

308
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,470
that's that's not a problem because

309
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,949
we've got him palestin our data center

310
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:39,520
fabric to take a look at this slide the

311
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:42,480
packet passes pretty the same but there

312
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:46,240
is just additional service level yeah

313
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:49,090
his edit of the button so in place

314
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,000
enables us to quickly address customers

315
00:14:49,090 --> 00:15:00,210
scenarios with very short the - to

316
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:03,190
launch new new services bare-metal case

317
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:05,320
once you started provide customers with

318
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:09,310
new services you you can stop doing so

319
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,050
another big customer comes and says that

320
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:14,290
he has seen some pictures of our data

321
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:17,979
center want grants in one to rent racks

322
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:20,439
in all of them and that's not the whole

323
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,990
story this customer also wants to

324
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,570
consume cloud services and as a chair on

325
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,460
the cake is wrong that etc and he wants

326
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:31,120
to interconnect all of that so to

327
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:36,780
interconnect those regs

328
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,780
cloud and his own data center

329
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:43,589
we turn some leaf switches into PE

330
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,160
routers in terms of ample s and and here

331
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:47,759
we go

332
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,219
so those lips which is now PE routers

333
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,589
encapsulate clients traffic in tempo

334
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,269
let's send it to the fabric and the

335
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:57,120
packets delivered to cloud get away if

336
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:59,850
they need to get to the the Overland

337
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,639
overlay network or to butter out or if

338
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:07,290
they need to get to customers on-premise

339
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:10,319
data center so eternal some switches

340
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:12,170
into PE routers was the one do we needed

341
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:16,259
to do to provide our customers with this

342
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:18,569
with this scenario there remain the the

343
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:22,050
rest in the network remained absolutely

344
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:23,610
untouched so this is just another

345
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:30,660
example how impressed neighbors are so

346
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:32,699
quickly launch and deliver services so

347
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:36,000
apparently that's the picture the

348
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:39,569
customer has seen you can see that our

349
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,189
typical data center point of delivery he

350
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:48,899
and X builds its own data centers and I

351
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:58,079
mean from Greenfield and that's just

352
00:16:48,899 --> 00:17:00,870
zoomed picture of Sorek and but by

353
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,790
showing all this I want you I want to

354
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,559
show you another great approach we've

355
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:08,280
been able to take because of input eyes

356
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,839
now that's a fabric this concept it's

357
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,849
your own the photo decoding what is this

358
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,770
concept about we are true believers in

359
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:16,559
this concept in basically this concept

360
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,839
means that you should consume the same

361
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,939
product you shoot yourself consume the

362
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,260
same product or infrastructure in our

363
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,720
case you provide your customers with

364
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,379
this is the only way to understand what

365
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,090
what the customer feel about the product

366
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,250
or the infrastructure what is good what

367
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:36,629
is bad in other words to have the same

368
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:41,789
experience to have the same pains at the

369
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:44,400
customer's health and I try to depict

370
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:47,790
the typical rack layout in in the data

371
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,030
center it's quite schematic but provide

372
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,820
the basic idea

373
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:54,330
so all the previously mentioned network

374
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,970
appliances are virtual machines

375
00:17:54,330 --> 00:18:00,360
unlike customer sutra machines which

376
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:04,420
live entirely in the overlay Network

377
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,939
these Network machines I mean network

378
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:10,920
appliances are directly connected to

379
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:16,990
their underlying network through wire

380
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:19,240
srvv functionality so anyway all these

381
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:21,910
network machines or all these virtual

382
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,760
machines live in the same racks which

383
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:28,000
customers and share the same racks

384
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:33,340
there are really literally alongside to

385
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,070
each other in in the same Rex so there

386
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,470
are common components in our there are

387
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:41,260
common cloud components for instance

388
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:44,230
cloud schedule which operates virtual

389
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,760
machines common network storage and the

390
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:55,510
common ethic infrastructure beneath

391
00:18:45,760 --> 00:19:00,520
after all so that all that so that all

392
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:01,420
that leads to to say all that

393
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,240
infrastructure

394
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:07,780
sharing common infrastructure sharing or

395
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,170
reusing the usage of the common

396
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:13,780
companies lowers our costs and all that

397
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:17,200
leads to firstly our customers benefit

398
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:18,910
from the reliable infrastructure because

399
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,480
we intend to keep our infrastructure

400
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:25,030
reliable in order to to be able run our

401
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,820
own critical network appliances and the

402
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:30,220
second as a result our infrastructure is

403
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,720
so reliable so we don't need to to run

404
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:36,070
our network appliances somewhere else

405
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:39,370
but in the same infrastructure so we

406
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,840
don't build any additional parallel

407
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:45,100
infrastructure to run our network

408
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:49,320
appliances that lowers our capex and we

409
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:52,360
don't need to we there is no need to run

410
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:56,409
there is no need to treat our network

411
00:19:52,360 --> 00:20:00,250
appliances in any special way and that

412
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:01,660
lowers our maintenance and optics

413
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:05,050
eventually

414
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:08,560
and because of impeller so now that is

415
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:10,360
in the fabric we can run Network

416
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:14,320
appliances wherever we want input and

417
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,750
input let's simply interconnect them we

418
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:22,450
are not limited by the size for instance

419
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:27,220
edge sport where typically network

420
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:33,100
related stuff allocated so appliances

421
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:35,140
ran in in points of delivery and what is

422
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,600
also nice that we can easily scale

423
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:41,820
Network appliances scale them out

424
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:45,070
whenever we need it when another

425
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,540
workload scan so that's that we can

426
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,700
scale them because they're a regular

427
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:54,820
virtual machine that's that's pretty

428
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:57,010
useful and now about some box we we have

429
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:00,070
encountered so everything wasn't that

430
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:02,110
shiny we had some bugs in do we have

431
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,389
actually we had a lot of bugs in data

432
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:07,899
plan we had a lot of bugs in control

433
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:09,760
plane and I want to show you sound so

434
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:15,130
take a look at this slide what's wrong

435
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,870
with this impellers heater it's wrong

436
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:23,020
because it shouldn't be there actually

437
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:24,520
because it's implicit now so many of you

438
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,110
who could code on Python knows that

439
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,910
explicit null is better than implicit

440
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:32,939
and apparently our bender things the

441
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:35,110
same way so implicit node is broken

442
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,710
that's not a problem we don't give up

443
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:39,850
that easily

444
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:44,640
let's try explicit no but it didn't work

445
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:49,709
and I think that piece of hardware just

446
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:52,750
takes ironic offset and normal packets

447
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:56,920
turn into garbage anyway those bugs were

448
00:21:52,750 --> 00:22:00,430
sorted just to show you and in the

449
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:02,260
conclusion so I could have actually I

450
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,970
could have had just only dead slide in

451
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:08,440
my presentation because this quote from

452
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:11,850
amazing book navigating Auto complex the

453
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,630
perfectly expand explains the key idea

454
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:17,539
but then I decided I needed more

455
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:22,820
pictures more examples so my

456
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:26,270
presentation to be accepted anyway

457
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:30,350
despite all the preconceptions we chose

458
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:34,370
in police because because it's fully

459
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:36,350
addressed our needs and implants

460
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:38,899
simplified and actually implies

461
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:41,899
simplified our data center network in

462
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:46,640
place is not complex especially the way

463
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:51,650
we use it but very powerful and the last

464
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:54,049
the last before before the lunch there

465
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:56,809
are talks or rumors that in police's

466
00:22:54,049 --> 00:23:00,650
dine already dead it's not in police

467
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:02,809
lives and prospers and hope it will so

468
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,880
thank you very much for attention and

469
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:07,420
yeah if you've got any question under

470
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:16,069
your disposal

471
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:16,069
[Applause]

472
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:25,740
anybody questions come on up

473
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:28,090
hi there Jason Brody Invesco great talk

474
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:30,520
just curious did you run into anything

475
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:33,100
with in your when you're always

476
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,860
collectors with a point of view are you

477
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,919
using like any BGP or are like optimal

478
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,080
amount reroute reflection or anything no

479
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:46,950
we don't have any idea routing

480
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:50,340
deflections yeah yeah just BGP a BGP for

481
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:56,860
they are resolution next hope okay

482
00:23:50,340 --> 00:24:01,959
thanks so now I GP at all yeah okay

483
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:05,830
anybody else going once going twice for

484
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:12,380
you spasiba thank you

485
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:12,379
[Applause]

486
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,260
you
