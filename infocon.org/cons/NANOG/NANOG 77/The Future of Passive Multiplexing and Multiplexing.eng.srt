1
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,669
I'm the CTO of solid optics were based

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,009
in LA and in Amsterdam were selling

3
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:22,829
compatible optics and this presentation

4
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:25,290
is about the future of beyond 10 gig

5
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:27,989
with multiplexing to challenge for me as

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:34,379
a CTO to find a solution for my

7
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:37,559
customers with this and from one gig to

8
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:39,570
10 gig it was easy you just had your Rob

9
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,459
take you at your passive multiplexer you

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,010
just swap your one gig up take you put

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,980
your Tang gig DWM optic in it you can

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,530
multiplex 10 gig but how does it work

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,660
for 25 kick 40 gig hundred kick and why

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,540
doesn't it work like that that is the

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,120
presentation for today and your

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,820
ingredients for multiplexing for dark

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,870
fiber project are three things you got

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,090
your dark fiber

19
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,828
you got your multiplexer and you got

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,500
your transceivers that send out that

21
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:10,710
specific light and I try to cover all

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,859
three of them first we'll start with dar

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,798
fiber the two constraints on the dark

24
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:19,559
fiber with light first of all you get

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,350
your attenuation and the attenuation is

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,490
the dimming of light the the brightness

27
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,318
of the light gets less over fiber that's

28
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,240
the first one the second one is

29
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,600
dispersion which is the blending of

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,699
light not all the light is traveling at

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,759
the same speed of light so there is a

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,579
merge of the signal so after 80

33
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:45,119
kilometer the pulses are a bit over

34
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,880
lined and blurred out that dispersion is

35
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,700
the biggest problem for higher speed as

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,130
you can see here until one gig you

37
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,520
didn't have that problem so you can do

38
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,439
DWM up to 200 kilometers no problem then

39
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,298
a 10 gig dispersed it gets a bit of a

40
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,678
problem because that 80 kilometer it's

41
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,719
kind of maxed out then a 25 kick that

42
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:10,080
dispersion gets a huge problem because

43
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:14,010
it's maxed out at 15 kilometers so you

44
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,970
cannot run DWM more than 15 kilometers

45
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:20,370
on 25k and this is just on the DWM

46
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,099
wavelength because dispersion and

47
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:26,099
attenuation differ a lot with

48
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,929
the frequency or the nanometers or the

49
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,099
colors how you want to call it so if

50
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:34,620
you're looking at a DWM or 5050 window

51
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:37,410
the orange line is the attenuation the

52
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,800
blue line is the dispersion you have low

53
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:44,069
attenuation you got like zero point two

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,700
one DB loss per kilometer for the DWM

55
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:51,510
but you could hide dispersion if you

56
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,640
look at the 1310 or where the LR or the

57
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,859
gray objects are emitting you hardly

58
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,950
have this person but you have high

59
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,319
attenuation so you don't have a perfect

60
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,988
color to admitting so you don't have a

61
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,119
perfect color to send traffic over you

62
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:10,860
always have or dispersion or you have

63
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:14,250
high attenuation the second ingredient

64
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:18,150
for for the dark fiber projects are

65
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:20,010
multiplexers multiplexers you can just

66
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,860
visualize it as a Dark Side of the Moon

67
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,569
the album of Pink Floyd where you have

68
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,450
multiple colors you just come to a

69
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:29,518
Prisma and then merge together go on the

70
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,170
dark fibre on the other side of the dark

71
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,889
fibre you get that line coming in and

72
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:37,290
the colors are getting out the colors

73
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:39,780
are emitted by specific optics that are

74
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,519
sending red green blue purple light out

75
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,329
that's how you should visualize how

76
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,850
passive motion works in reality it works

77
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:50,970
differently you get two types of passive

78
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:55,650
Marx's one is built with cascaded tff

79
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:57,660
filters the other one is AWG 95% of all

80
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:01,319
the communication worldwide will go over

81
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:06,209
cascaded tff filters the little tubes of

82
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:09,030
like an inch big and they get three

83
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,280
fibers they've got a fiber going in with

84
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,400
and they got one fibre going out with

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,039
one color and one fiber with the rest of

86
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:23,400
the spectrum as you can see here every

87
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:25,229
little tube has 0.3 DB loss and 95% of

88
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,349
all the mixes and all the audience are

89
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:30,740
working like this and they are cascaded

90
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:34,620
so here you see an image of an 8-channel

91
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:36,720
CWM MUX and it will start with 1470 tube

92
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,970
we'll take the Colorado

93
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,250
softer spectrum we'll go to the 49 tube

94
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,100
takes that color out and then the rest

95
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,490
will go to the 50 10 tube and so on and

96
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,370
so on all these cascaded tubes of fusion

97
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:53,850
spliced and put in a little box called

98
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,720
an ABS casing two of these so the MUX

99
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,390
and the d-max

100
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,340
are put together in a passive knocks in

101
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:02,789
a 19-inch case in what you all recognize

102
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,669
in your data center this is how a

103
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:08,610
typical MUX works you have another type

104
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:11,220
as well it's called an a WG and this is

105
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,350
more for the higher count so if you have

106
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,390
your 40 channel marks you've got a 96

107
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,370
channel marks you're gonna need this

108
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,560
time you don't want to have 40 times

109
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:23,310
zero point three DB loss because you

110
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,500
talked about 12 to be lost for a MUX so

111
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,140
this is built on a chip it's another

112
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,720
technique a more complex technique that

113
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,630
is if you have 40 channel you have to

114
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,730
use this and it's a cheaper solution the

115
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,430
assertion loss of MUX is like this are

116
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:41,070
starting at 3 DB so if you have a

117
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:45,630
typical one it's 40 channel Maps it's 3

118
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:47,340
to be as you can see here they have a

119
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,050
transmission window they got different

120
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,020
transmission window if you look at the

121
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:55,560
picture here the red line is the DWM

122
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,150
light the DWM light always moves a bit

123
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,890
it's got a spec but because of

124
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,669
temperature will move a bit to the left

125
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:04,680
to the right but that's normal that is

126
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:07,229
so it's moving in the green area which

127
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,200
is the reference pass band the

128
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:12,450
attenuation is the yellow block there

129
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,810
and of course you want to have as low

130
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:18,510
attenuation as possible but you have two

131
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:21,060
different types of transmission window

132
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:23,700
one is the Gaussian fit and the other

133
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,010
one is a flat top the Gaussian fit is a

134
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,650
more point here one way you have lower

135
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:31,219
tinge attenuation in a sweet spot in the

136
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:35,159
middle but your pass band is a bit

137
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:38,460
narrower I also have a flat top which

138
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,860
has a deviation of say 4 and a half to

139
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:44,549
be 404 channel the Gaussian fit will

140
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:47,310
have 3 DB max attenuation your flat top

141
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,060
has a wider reference pass band

142
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:54,360
and more attenuation why is this

143
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:58,980
important in the future you will have

144
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:02,090
different types of waves you DWM tang ik

145
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:06,360
is a pretty narrow wave it will fit

146
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:09,840
perfectly in your Gaussian fit max aw

147
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,560
gee max but a coherent 100 Gig 200 gig

148
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,669
for and 800 gig can have wider waves the

149
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:20,400
same as the DWM pam-4 is a wider wave if

150
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:22,500
you would use a Gaussian fit it will

151
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,859
bounce to the isolation and you will

152
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,500
have more attenuation there and the flat

153
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,380
top it you're gonna need a flattop and

154
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,530
all the tff filter so the regular

155
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:38,000
matches are all using tff or flattop

156
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:40,950
filters so you won't have that problem I

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,010
found out it's just the hard way because

158
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:46,200
we're building a DW in pam-4 solution

159
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:49,080
and this is costing me four days to find

160
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,469
out so I wanted to help you avoid this

161
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,620
issue the third ingredient for

162
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,500
multiplexing is light or the transceiver

163
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:02,040
itself

164
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:03,990
we got three windows itu grids we all

165
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,240
know the CWM we all know the DW and

166
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:09,510
there is a new bandwidth is getting a

167
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,480
bit more popular called the LW a LW d MN

168
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,400
the LW m band doesn't have any

169
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,230
dispersion remember that is at the

170
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,479
thirty ten you don't have to dispersion

171
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,400
so you can get higher speeds in that

172
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,010
region

173
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:26,580
well the L WDM multiplexing you could do

174
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:29,430
eight channels in that 1310 band so it's

175
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,560
eight times twenty-five cake up to 40

176
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,680
kilometers because remember you had that

177
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,900
higher attenuation there the advantage

178
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,179
is you can just use regular passive

179
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,000
mixers regular updates hook that up and

180
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:45,390
it works in the future you will also

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,730
have hundred gig up to fifteen or maybe

182
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:50,400
even forty kilometers that will come and

183
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:53,880
this is used a lot in Korea and China

184
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,850
for five gig implementation because it's

185
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,010
such a cheap technology they're using

186
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:01,310
just a couple of 25 gigs to the cell

187
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:06,590
power and this is the cheaper

188
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:09,709
way to do that so if you want to do more

189
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:12,680
than ten gig with a dispersion you have

190
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:15,760
what you can do is modulation typically

191
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,459
if you have a 10 gig signal it sends out

192
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,950
zeros and ones so you have a tank exist

193
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:26,060
know with 10 gig data but if you will

194
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:29,120
find a way of sending more per bout then

195
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:32,529
you could do more data per 10 gig about

196
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,060
rate that's actually what modulation is

197
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:37,010
with modulation you have got different

198
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,479
techniques you get a ton of techniques I

199
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,150
won't go through all of them I just

200
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,790
visualize a couple of them in that

201
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:47,230
amplitude modulation where you just

202
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,490
instead of doing on and off or dim and

203
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,920
completely offer completely on you

204
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:54,920
making different stages in it so you do

205
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,900
have them fooled them and so on so you

206
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,870
can make four stages in it and you also

207
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,520
have face so your Sinus curve is not in

208
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,220
the middle but just a bit to the left

209
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:07,220
and a bit to the right those techniques

210
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:10,910
the amplitude and the face they are used

211
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:13,220
nowadays in your 400 gig modulation you

212
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:16,030
can combine these two as well where you

213
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:19,790
have amplitude and you get phase and

214
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:21,530
that's if you have for amplitude or for

215
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:25,099
amplitude and for phases

216
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:28,130
4 times 4 makes 16 different positions

217
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:32,300
where your signal can be so that is

218
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:34,010
called 16 com so in you have a lower

219
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,260
bound rate but you have more

220
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:39,319
possibilities that there are so you can

221
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:42,950
multiplex at times 16 these techniques

222
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:46,790
are used in modulation for example in

223
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:49,880
this coherent hundred gig of take to use

224
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:53,360
the modulation you need a DSP chip the

225
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:56,180
digital signal processing chip this

226
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,890
needs a lot of power a lot of watts so

227
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:03,260
for example the CP 2d CEO needs 20 Watts

228
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:05,480
we are all using Q 2 P 28 and we want a

229
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,270
solution in the Q's of P 28 because your

230
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,820
cisco juniper Sienna router is using

231
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:13,250
that but that is maxed out to four and a

232
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,780
half what so that modulation technique

233
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,210
of comms

234
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:20,060
sixteen thumb doesn't fit in accuse of

235
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:26,990
heat 28 so in a way you need an extra

236
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:30,430
box to put that CP 2 D Co in there is a

237
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:33,710
solution with QP 28 it's using Pam for

238
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:36,680
modulation it's not a really really

239
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:39,470
strong modulation so it does fit in the

240
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,449
queues of P 28 but due to that

241
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,880
modulation power there's no optical

242
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,910
budget left so it's hardly cents like

243
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,880
that so you need a box to amplify that

244
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:53,480
light pam-4 also needs dispersion

245
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:56,600
compensation so you're gonna need a box

246
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,280
with em with an ad file with a tunable

247
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,800
dispersion compensator on the inside

248
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:03,800
this is one of the cheapest way of

249
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,479
multiplexing multiple hundred cakes from

250
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,069
one side to the other Microsoft is

251
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,980
pushing this technology for years

252
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,960
already to put like 32 times hundred gig

253
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,930
over 70 kilometers to their other data

254
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:18,530
center so that is pushing this

255
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:20,510
technology we built a solution for this

256
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,400
as one we call it an all-in-one button

257
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:26,920
at for markzware you have everything

258
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:32,780
inside just a summary of the solutions

259
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:35,150
you get the l WDM you could have 40 you

260
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:37,310
could up to 40 kilometers eight times 25

261
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:41,209
kick also a hundred kick in the future

262
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:43,219
your lwm objects will be roughly 400 500

263
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:45,430
dollars your passive much will be 500

264
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:49,670
dollars so that's a really cheap way of

265
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:53,390
multiplexing more than 10 gig then you

266
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:56,510
could accuse of P pam-4 solution the

267
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:59,689
optics itself will be around three and a

268
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:01,910
half K the Box the white box there in

269
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,460
the mail will be around six and a half

270
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:07,640
seven K so you will start with pancake

271
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:10,640
first sight to start multiplex

272
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,370
more a hundred gig and more up to 80

273
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:17,540
kilometer they have the third solution

274
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:19,970
will be the CFP to DCO solution you'll

275
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,459
start with uqz PSR which will go into

276
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:25,490
your router switch that will put to an

277
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:27,890
extra box where you will have your CP to

278
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,370
d0 in and that will go to your passive

279
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,610
marks

280
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:38,709
pricing will be around 17 K to 20k per

281
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:41,769
site for that there is an erotic my

282
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:45,339
previous presenter all also showed this

283
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:48,379
400 gig is coming for 100 gigs said our

284
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:50,660
it's gonna be an accused PDD when I made

285
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:53,839
the presentation a couple of months ago

286
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,689
I thought it would go from one gig to 10

287
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,480
gig then nothing and then it would be a

288
00:13:56,689 --> 00:14:02,089
400 gig tunable Zedd art that you can

289
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,129
just plug in your router switch putting

290
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:07,309
a pass of Max and it will transport in

291
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:07,970
80 kilometer as far as I've seen the

292
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:10,550
MSAs

293
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:13,519
right now you're gonna need at fast for

294
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,439
it and before there is an optic ready we

295
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,589
can just plug it in your router switch

296
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:20,569
put it in your passive box tunable 80

297
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:23,870
kilometers and put another one in it

298
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:25,939
will take 2-3 years I've checked also

299
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,639
with some suppliers from us and the

300
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:33,829
first version they will need advice for

301
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:36,679
this a couple of additional hints for

302
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:39,229
also because we were bill were testing a

303
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:41,410
lot of hundred gig optics and we're

304
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,819
building this box and we came with a

305
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:48,199
couple of problems as well one of them

306
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:50,360
is our as vac we've been having a lot of

307
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:53,059
issues also support cases with our as

308
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,600
fact you have for example a melon or 200

309
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:59,600
gig card and the air RS vac is always on

310
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,929
if you have on the other side and optic

311
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:06,769
and LR SR or takes sometimes it's off so

312
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:10,309
not all the vendors implemented as the

313
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:13,399
RS vac the same way if you cannot get a

314
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:15,439
link with 100 Gig you might look to our

315
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:17,149
spec if you look at a solar topics TV

316
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:19,279
channel a YouTube channel that's a nice

317
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:21,819
movie about that could save you a couple

318
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,819
of days of debugging as well another

319
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:28,099
hint I would like to give is clean for

320
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:28,729
the one gig and Tangut you could get

321
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,490
away with it

322
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:34,699
it was like more marketing than actually

323
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:37,339
needed we didn't find a lot of problems

324
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:40,128
with 1 gig 10 gig and also about 80

325
