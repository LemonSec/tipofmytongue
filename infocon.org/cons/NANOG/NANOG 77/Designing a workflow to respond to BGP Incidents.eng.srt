00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:23,550
Thank You Katherine I'm job Snider's I

2
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:26,759
work for NTT this talk is a attempt to

3
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,030
open up conversation with fellow network

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:35,250
operators and carriers about how do we

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:37,890
respond to BGP incidents this talk is

6
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,500
not an acute example of what is actually

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,739
live in production at entity this is an

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:48,239
attempt to solicit feedback from you as

9
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:51,328
a community and to figure out how can we

10
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:57,030
produce consistent responses if Beach P

11
00:00:51,329 --> 00:01:00,960
incidences happen I think in designing a

12
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:04,320
workflow where we try to figure out how

13
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,899
we can respond to BGP incidents there

14
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,789
are a few crucial steps and we'll go

15
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:13,710
through them in the slide deck one by

16
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:17,250
one when you get a call that is good to

17
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:22,740
collect evidence make an analysis and

18
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:25,920
then react in some way so you receive a

19
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:29,839
call somebody says you are facilitating

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:34,619
a BGP hijack you're horrible

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:37,380
then what if they're right you should

22
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,780
immediately take action you should alter

23
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:44,939
your router configurations you should do

24
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:49,280
something somewhere if they're wrong you

25
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:52,279
may cut off the wrong customer and I

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,470
think talking about this type of problem

27
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:59,310
to produce a more consistent response

28
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:02,700
amongst multiple carriers is why we are

29
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,610
here right now so let's go through some

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,600
of this feel the wrath close you answers

31
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:13,440
you are hijacking my range what is

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:18,900
happening an entity knock should respond

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:22,049
how they should figure out is this

34
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,810
person actually feel the wrath is he

35
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:25,650
actually a legitimate holder of this

36
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,549
resource is

37
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,170
the who assess yes because the worst

38
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:33,629
thing that can happen is that people

39
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,500
call in to the not claiming a sense of

40
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:39,720
an aspect of abuse and then that you

41
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,379
shut off the wrong customer because

42
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,810
false information so I sure that the

43
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,970
relation to the reporter is something

44
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:52,700
that you can rely on and that you

45
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:56,870
understand who they are when they call

46
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:59,069
ask for specific questions you need to

47
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:03,859
figure out what is it they actually

48
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,858
expect to happen in the global Internet

49
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:11,220
routing table it's the what is the exact

50
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,109
prefix they're complaining about those

51
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,310
does their complaint match what you see

52
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,010
your BGP tables

53
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:21,389
let us expect a prefix length what is

54
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:25,170
the expected origination in this

55
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:27,239
scenario given that we've managed as a

56
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:30,358
community to set up fairly complex

57
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:34,530
systems where we are any casting HTTP

58
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:37,230
services it may also be good to ask for

59
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:40,139
a website endpoint or some other surface

60
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:46,168
where you can verify what the expected

61
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:48,389
outcome of the operation is so when you

62
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:52,590
receive the call you pick up the phone

63
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:55,169
people tell you this and this is not as

64
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,859
I was hoping it would be in the routing

65
00:03:55,169 --> 00:04:02,729
system you should collect a steady state

66
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:05,790
of what the network actually is is doing

67
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:10,650
at this moment in the case of NCT we

68
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:13,798
have a filter generation daemon running

69
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,440
at our entity dotnet that is the

70
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,650
production instance that feeds into our

71
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,610
router context so somebody calls and

72
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:25,620
says something is wrong inspecting this

73
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:29,400
publicly available surface can help

74
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:32,340
analyze what was documented as railing

75
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,679
intentions and what

76
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,000
and whether that contradicts what the

77
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,820
reporter is telling you

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,190
so these who is commands will give an

79
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:46,409
overview of the RPG I or I are objects

80
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,450
that exist in the system and are used in

81
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,610
the filter generation process and

82
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:56,210
they're the first step to understand

83
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:59,670
what is what is happening so here's some

84
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:02,909
example outputs if you issue a command

85
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:08,520
like this you'll retrieve the router

86
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:13,590
objects or RPI statements that influence

87
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:20,039
what ebgp filters are related to this

88
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:23,929
particular prefix now another method of

89
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,910
inspection is to go out to the various

90
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:30,080
route collection initiatives that exists

91
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:33,320
there's the analogue ring Looking Glass

92
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:37,890
ripe ncc has to produce a beautiful

93
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:40,560
platform called ripe stat there's a

94
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:44,700
public instance of a validator available

95
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:48,090
as our PK validator ripeness that allows

96
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:51,120
you to compare Beach P informations who

97
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:53,750
published our OS and there's a tool

98
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,330
called IR Explorer that also helps

99
00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:03,750
understand what perhaps were the

100
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:06,419
intentions of the resource holder other

101
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:10,410
than looking at published information

102
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:13,620
about routing intentions it's perhaps

103
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,530
also good to capture what is your

104
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,770
network actually doing in this moment

105
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:22,500
what is in the beach p rip level

106
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,979
available in your network and what is

107
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,530
happening in the forwarding plane so

108
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:30,570
capturing the routes capturing a trace

109
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:33,690
route towards the destination that is

110
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:39,210
hijacked can be useful to understand

111
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:42,780
what is happening and this is an example

112
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,549
from an NCT router where in the upper

113
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,909
half we see the norm

114
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,030
steady state which is what we expect to

115
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:54,210
happen but the second entry is the

116
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:59,280
hijack that is in progress where my

117
00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:05,070
personal Aysen is rerouting traffic for

118
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:07,320
this specific destination trace routes

119
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:10,680
are very very helpful

120
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,080
every ebgp router that exists in your

121
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,540
network has a slightly different view on

122
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,840
the routing tables all of them has have

123
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:21,630
this tree view - - all internet

124
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,460
destinations you can reach and trace

125
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:26,159
routes can help you in this instance to

126
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:29,520
understand where ours where as traffic

127
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:35,280
actually sends because the previous

128
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:37,289
slide is just one router and if you have

129
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,780
hundreds of routers they may all have

130
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:42,350
slightly separate information available

131
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,479
to them slightly different forwarding

132
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:48,150
decisions are made so trace routes are

133
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:54,630
very useful debugging information in

134
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:57,450
this instance should you be too late in

135
00:07:54,630 --> 00:08:03,060
a sense that by the time the reporter

136
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:05,010
tells you I was hijacked or even worse

137
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,920
when they call you a few days after

138
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:12,450
effect and say a few days ago you were

139
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:18,780
part of high-tech capturing this in

140
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:21,800
motion information is much harder retro

141
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:25,070
actively analyzing why hijacks happens

142
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:29,820
is fairly time consuming because we

143
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:31,680
would need to replay the states of the

144
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:33,929
network as it existed during your

145
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:39,240
high-tech or even search for the events

146
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:43,169
where it went wrong it's hard but it's

147
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,420
possible and I think it's ok to do such

148
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:48,449
things on a case-by-case cases depending

149
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,750
on the relation with the reporting but

150
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:54,540
this type of post-mortem analyzing what

151
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,619
hijack occurred where the crew which of

152
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:01,800
your routers accepted the hijack

153
00:08:57,619 --> 00:09:05,339
all of that is much easier when there is

154
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:09,209
feeding into the public routing system

155
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:12,600
observer collective the the likes of a

156
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:15,599
soul arrow or ripe race or a route views

157
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,720
if we keep contributing data to such

158
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,790
systems it allows us to analyze in

159
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,920
retrospect what actually happens what

160
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:29,910
transpired was this a mistake or

161
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:33,660
malicious act the purpose of those urls

162
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:35,610
is not just to collect information on

163
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:39,029
what the state of the network is from

164
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:43,110
viewed from within internally or viewed

165
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:45,240
from the outside but these urls can also

166
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,389
help you understand if something

167
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,179
actually is wrong or not in the case of

168
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:54,860
the analog ring looking-glass with

169
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:58,709
you're all invited to appear with that

170
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:02,309
the web interface will indicate to you

171
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:04,378
an initial assessment whether a route

172
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:06,569
announcement conforms to published

173
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:09,449
routing intentions or not so in the case

174
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:11,519
of this incident which is actually a

175
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:15,679
life example i am at this moment

176
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:19,199
hijacking feos range with its permission

177
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,869
but if you go to this URL you will see

178
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:24,179
that this is an announcement that exists

179
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:30,720
but is invalid according to RPG I

180
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:35,759
published information I've seen

181
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:39,990
incidences where IRS were abused in one

182
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:44,670
way or another where attackers would

183
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:47,279
publish information for a few minutes

184
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:50,160
wait for a filter generation processes

185
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:54,240
to do their thing and then the objects

186
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:58,469
were deleted again to make analysis of

187
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:02,249
what is happening harder and the same

188
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:04,559
goes for RPK the the not the same type

189
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:07,079
of problem but this is information that

190
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,779
can change over time if there are

191
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,560
compromised accounts if if somehow

192
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,860
somebody

193
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,689
Taine's the keys to the kingdom and

194
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:18,300
published information that is not

195
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,920
aligned with business operations it is

196
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,790
prudent to capture this type of

197
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,120
information

198
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:28,290
so I myself I'm making copies of the

199
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:31,080
higher and RPI every few hours to go to

200
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:34,589
have the ability to go back in time if

201
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:38,400
you're not doing that when you get a

202
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:39,060
call from somebody you are hijacking my

203
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,490
space

204
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,099
it is good to collect the current state

205
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:50,760
of operations that influence your

206
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:53,160
network and other aspects in designing

207
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,580
work flows around BGP hijacks is to

208
00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:00,839
analyze whether the reporter is the same

209
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:05,130
entity as the victim i've curiously

210
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:09,420
enough reported on bgp incidents where i

211
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:12,000
was not the victim at all but about a

212
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:16,140
year ago when the US government was in

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,810
shutdown mode many departments did not

214
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:23,449
have the ability to defend themselves

215
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:26,609
because employees were benched at home i

216
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:28,910
it it's very strange to at some point

217
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:32,760
call are they're curious and say well

218
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:39,209
you're facilitating a hijack but i have

219
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:41,520
no relation to the victim but regardless

220
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:45,030
of that it's it's okay to report on

221
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,920
things that don't necessarily affect

222
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:49,100
your own business operations you're in a

223
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:54,060
way doing someone else a favor and

224
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:58,100
helping them by what is in your mind to

225
00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:00,810
correct entity reporting incidents there

226
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,670
however in the case where the reporter

227
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:05,369
of the incidents actually is the

228
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:09,449
resource older than souls it is also a

229
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:13,190
fair question to analyze impact if all

230
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:16,140
their resources are hijacked or leaks

231
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,950
clearly that operates impacts their

232
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,430
whole operation

233
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:23,080
but maybe space that they're not

234
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:27,339
actively using as hijacked

235
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:29,470
this too is a state that can exist and

236
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,320
it's good to discuss with the report II

237
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:35,580
what they think the impact is because in

238
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:39,130
a network operation center we need to

239
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:42,910
prioritize what is the next task we're

240
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:46,330
going to do and having feedback on the

241
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:48,579
importance of prefixes can help analyze

242
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:51,160
should I drop all the work I'm doing

243
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,690
right now and focus on this incident or

244
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:57,370
is this something we can deal with in

245
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:59,230
the next 60 or 90 minutes other than

246
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,700
what the reporter is telling you you

247
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:05,580
yourself can do an impact analysis by

248
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:08,650
investigating in your statistic system

249
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:11,530
what this prefix represents is this in

250
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:14,110
your top talkers or as a prefix where no

251
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:17,500
traffic was flowing anyway and this

252
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:20,080
helps analyze the impact to the victim

253
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:28,180
but it also helps analyze the impact to

254
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:30,280
your own organization actions you can

255
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:33,520
take after receiving a report after

256
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:36,010
concluding that this is not what things

257
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,290
should be it may be your own

258
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:41,040
organization it may be a customer it may

259
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,150
be a customer of a customer that is

260
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:48,819
introducing routing information that is

261
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:51,760
not helpful but sources to use all the

262
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,980
sources to figure out how to reach the

263
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,010
originator of the Mis configuration or

264
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:00,700
hijack this information exists in rdap

265
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:03,550
in who is in peering to be open all

266
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:09,100
those things in your browser and call

267
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:12,280
all the phone numbers I found many times

268
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,270
when picking up the phone and calling

269
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,980
people

270
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:20,050
hey you're announcing something you

271
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:23,140
should not be announcing that if it is

272
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:26,530
an accidental Mis configuration people

273
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,780
are very very cooperative they are happy

274
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:31,930
to help they will immediately recognize

275
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:34,170
oh you're right thirty minutes ago I did

276
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:37,170
this and this and

277
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:40,800
thank you for your call picking up the

278
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:44,520
phone and calling while strangers on the

279
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,290
Internet is daunting it's kind of crazy

280
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,800
that we can pick up the phone and call

281
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:51,569
people and say hey your your your

282
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,510
routing is interfering with my routing

283
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:57,060
but it's very very rewarding

284
00:15:54,510 --> 00:16:01,939
almost every phone call I made in this

285
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:04,589
context resulted in fixing the issue so

286
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,330
in this modern day and age we don't

287
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,490
really like phone calls anymore we like

288
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:11,010
texting each other but when it comes to

289
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:17,100
bgp hijacks i can strongly recommend

290
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:20,550
using pts and should the originating

291
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,980
party either not pick up the phone or

292
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:25,229
not responds in a meaningful way to

293
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:29,780
address the issue that you're dealing

294
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:32,970
with the the next escalation level is to

295
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:35,160
approach their peers or upstreams

296
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:38,070
because at the end of the day maybe

297
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,689
someone is originating an issue but

298
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,490
their upstreams

299
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,830
or peers are the ones that are

300
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:49,140
amplifying the issue by propagating this

301
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:52,500
routing information and if you if you

302
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:56,130
look at the a s path of a BGP hijack it

303
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,980
what I would say is work from the the

304
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:03,600
right side of that string towards the

305
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:06,720
left side call first people that are

306
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:12,120
closer to the hijack rather than more

307
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:16,130
removed from the hi-tech the reporter of

308
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:18,629
the issue should be invited to become

309
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:22,890
part of the team that tries to address

310
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:25,199
this issue themselves what we're not

311
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:28,230
really looking for is that random people

312
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,260
call us about random routing incidents

313
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:34,050
and try to outsource resolving that

314
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:37,140
route routing incidents to to our NOC

315
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:40,260
they themselves if they are the resource

316
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,750
holder specifically when the reporter is

317
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,309
also the same entity as the victim have

318
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,580
the most powerful voice in

319
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:53,620
instructing other companies this is not

320
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:57,879
how things should be and I guess what

321
00:17:53,620 --> 00:18:02,260
I'm trying to say is that carriers can

322
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:04,210
be a good ally to contact people or

323
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,360
figure out who to contact or a look at

324
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,580
routing information but as the resource

325
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,418
folder you have the most powerful voice

326
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,918
in in correctly stating this is what

327
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:16,659
should happen this is what should not

328
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:20,980
happen and this is how it impacts my

329
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:26,980
business so everybody should pick up the

330
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:31,480
phone now we've talked a little bit

331
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:34,600
about how to respond to incidents and of

332
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,809
course I also want to mention how we can

333
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:41,980
perhaps prevent some of these incidents

334
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:44,500
and in this day and age we have two

335
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:47,909
technologies available to us that are

336
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,590
very helpful in either preventing

337
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:53,740
misconfigurations

338
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:56,820
or reducing the negative impacts of

339
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:59,559
hijacks as they occur and these are

340
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:04,389
original foundation based on our PGI

341
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:10,539
data and direct peering let's go through

342
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:14,559
a small use case in the case of direct

343
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:17,559
peering but a miss origination of a

344
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,139
certain prefix rpki information can help

345
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:22,980
your border routers make better routing

346
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,909
choices in this example there is a

347
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,600
prefixes being announced by the

348
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:31,960
legitimate entity authorized to announce

349
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:35,559
that set of IP addresses and there is

350
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:38,020
the attacker a s and I my own ASA and

351
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:41,049
again this is a live example if you want

352
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:43,059
to go through workflow trainings in your

353
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:46,120
own operation center you can use this

354
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:50,740
prefix to try and figure out what is

355
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:53,620
correct what is not correct the the

356
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:56,430
example here is that the CDN operator

357
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:59,520
actually uses our peak area information

358
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:02,310
to do bgp origin validation and they

359
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:06,900
have a invalid is reject policy on their

360
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:09,389
edge routers the Miss configuration is

361
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,460
rejected because the origination does

362
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,860
not match up with the published Airways

363
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:17,970
and this happens automatically

364
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:20,639
nice should they be a different type of

365
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:25,620
issue where for instance there is either

366
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:30,450
a leak or the origination is spoofed in

367
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:32,580
the a SPF attribute what happens if you

368
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:35,580
apply original fala Dacian and it's

369
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:39,389
combined with direct peering is that the

370
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:42,500
spoofer will have a longer a SPF because

371
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:46,230
they cannot necessarily spoof their own

372
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:49,080
the the victims is an on the direct ebgp

373
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:51,270
sessions with you they have to insert

374
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,550
themselves in the path and pretend that

375
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:57,000
they receive this information from

376
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:59,639
elsewhere so in this instance even

377
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,190
though from an RPG hype original

378
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,740
validation perspective the BGP updates

379
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:08,310
passes because the origin matches with

380
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:12,060
our way the fact that there was direct

381
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:14,669
peering an SPF length was a

382
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:18,240
consideration in choosing which path to

383
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:22,290
to use prevented the incorrect

384
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:26,880
information from being used in

385
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:29,220
forwarding decisions so up until this

386
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,410
point many of us have done direct

387
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,470
peering with each other for often

388
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:37,350
economic reasons approach each other and

389
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:39,630
say hey I have this bulk of traffic I am

390
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:42,030
sending or receiving from you it'd be

391
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:49,190
really nice if we cut out the middleman

392
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:52,740
like NTT and just peer directly and that

393
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:56,760
strategy to reduce costs to to manage

394
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:59,000
capacity to reduce latency and blah blah

395
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:03,420
blah about all the benefits of peering

396
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,690
also coincidentally is useful as a

397
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,470
security mechanism especially when you

398
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,450
also do original validation

399
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,810
on your border routers so what I'm

400
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:16,240
saying us direct peering is cool for

401
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:25,080
financial reasons but also for security

402
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:29,470
reasons if you do origin validation the

403
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:32,100
going back to how hijacks are even part

404
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:37,420
of the ecosystem or are allowed to enter

405
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:40,000
our global routing system it happens

406
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:44,650
from time to time that it was a Mis

407
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:48,970
configuration combined with outdated or

408
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:51,250
rogue IR information and that the hijack

409
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,980
was possible in the first place because

410
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:56,620
there were entries in the system that

411
00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:02,440
did not contribute to correct

412
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:05,979
configurations getting rid of incorrect

413
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:12,370
IR information often is a very fast way

414
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:13,690
to get filters updated to stop and

415
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,270
hijack emotion

416
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:18,580
if carriers are generating their router

417
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,340
conflicts based off I are information

418
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:26,199
cleaning up to IRR information in an of

419
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:30,970
itself is a surefire way to block rogue

420
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:33,580
announcements and if we go back to this

421
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:36,880
example prefix throughout this

422
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:40,360
presentation the sneaky thing I put in

423
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,400
there is a minute typo the - and the

424
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,580
free are really close to each other on

425
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,130
my keyboard and if I type it in once

426
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:50,290
copy paste it and then copy paste it

427
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:53,110
into my router configuration this is

428
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:55,389
actually how you end up with miss

429
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:59,939
configurations or routing incidents like

430
00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:01,630
this the router object could be created

431
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:05,860
the Revel object--

432
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:07,860
was copy pasted that that string was was

433
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,310
used in my router configuration and

434
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,620
there you have it

435
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:16,300
we're announcing a prefix we should not

436
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:19,270
be announcing at all so use this example

437
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:21,280
in your network operation center sent

438
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:22,300
them this prefix say I think there's a

439
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:26,370
hijack happening

440
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:30,610
what do we do now this is a suitable

441
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:32,559
prefix for that purpose and we've done

442
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:36,729
we're approaching the end of my

443
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:40,090
presentation and I would like to open up

444
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:42,580
the floor for comments suggestions what

445
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:46,389
is it that is missing from these steps

446
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:49,840
what evidence are we overlooking let's

447
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:54,130
design a corporate workflow out in the

448
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:57,220
open good job my name is Marlon from

449
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:59,290
Cisco Systems what initiatives do you

450
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:02,830
know of the dealing with cleaning a

451
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:05,530
puppy so one of the things we've seen is

452
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:08,710
that the information was covering about

453
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:14,649
80% of the prefix places irregularly

454
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:16,929
updated and not well secured I didn't

455
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,630
entirely catch her a question he is a

456
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:21,670
repeat or rephrase so there's a big

457
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:24,790
effort being done with our away in rpki

458
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:26,800
in dealing with coverage and updating

459
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:32,500
prefix space but I puresole seems to

460
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:36,190
have been left behind there are some

461
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:38,679
efforts on their way to reduce the

462
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:41,260
negative impact that IR can have on

463
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:44,350
operations for instance in the ripe

464
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:47,700
region there is a proposal spearheaded

465
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:51,340
by myself and some fellow operators to

466
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:54,130
leverage our PK information to conclude

467
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:57,459
what I our our information is describing

468
00:25:54,130 --> 00:26:00,250
impossible situations and we're working

469
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,860
to produce software that will use our PK

470
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:06,370
information to clean up delete or

471
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:09,459
suppress IR information that is in

472
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:12,340
conflict with that so there are efforts

473
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,920
on the way to improve the IR situation

474
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:20,790
or to reduce the negative impact of the

475
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:20,790
IR s situation thank you

476
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:28,160
was i next Trudy Carol you know go we've

477
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:31,020
got it Jeff Hairston a penis

478
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,420
I'm following most of what you're saying

479
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,770
and thinking this is cool but the one

480
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,140
thing that I found a little bit

481
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:40,500
difficult to swallow was when you talked

482
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:44,190
about direct peering and that is a

483
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:47,370
defense against path stuffing the issue

484
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:49,380
that we see in reality is that at least

485
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,379
30% of all announced routes have

486
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:55,650
prepending somewhere and the prepend is

487
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:59,970
normally two to three a SS now if your

488
00:26:55,650 --> 00:27:02,430
answer is everybody else should peer

489
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:04,440
with the five tier ones and the entire

490
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:06,780
Internet should flatten to an a s length

491
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,150
path length of two that's a fine answer

492
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,490
I don't believe it but you know it's a

493
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:14,180
fine answer to the problem the reality

494
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:16,530
is a little more prosaic than that that

495
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:18,810
realistically there is a large area

496
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:23,280
which version of reality are you

497
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:27,030
referring to of the reality of bgp there

498
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:29,580
is a lot of capability out there to

499
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:32,460
actually do path based attacks preserve

500
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:35,040
the origin and get rid of the prepends

501
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,350
and insert yourself in it's there as a

502
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:40,889
possibility and and it certainly needs

503
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:44,730
to be acknowledged that we don't have

504
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:47,280
bgp sec with path protection now origin

505
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:49,530
validation does some of it but there is

506
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,920
still a class of unsolved problem out

507
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:55,350
there that we can't just wish away it is

508
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:58,440
an unsolved problem that's a point I was

509
00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:01,129
trying to make in my version of reality

510
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:05,130
it's a majority of traffic that matters

511
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:10,020
flows over links where the a s path is

512
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:12,900
one Internet is shifting away from a

513
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:15,810
model where where you use multiple

514
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:18,180
transits to reach everything we we love

515
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:20,100
Tyriq peering for economic reasons as I

516
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,350
mentioned before cutting out the

517
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:26,669
middlemen which is the large networks

518
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:30,689
often is a sensible thing to do so

519
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:33,000
appear with each other that is why where

520
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:35,970
I think incident routing will be robust

521
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,880
and we've seen that the average s path

522
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:39,070
length is not

523
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,800
increasing year after year somehow it

524
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:44,620
remains flat we somehow keep connecting

525
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:48,270
to each other and I'm suggested that the

526
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:50,709
property is average length is not one

527
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:52,710
I'll leave it alone I think routing is

528
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:58,750
gonna say much the same I'll leave it

529
00:28:52,710 --> 00:29:02,220
well a kind of first let me say I'm very

530
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:05,920
happy about VX an excellent approach of

531
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:10,660
starting to discuss this I think we will

532
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:14,890
need some way for many parties to

533
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:21,360
contribute because the devil is in the

534
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:26,170
details and actually actually the path

535
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:30,189
the use of the short a s path is one

536
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:35,620
part where I was thinking I should just

537
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:39,790
put in the pointer that the common gal

538
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:43,209
Rexford policy of doing a local prep for

539
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:46,230
your customers regardless how stupid

540
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:49,510
long they're a s path is for example

541
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:54,640
interferes with your with your security

542
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:57,910
argument and if we work such procedures

543
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:04,150
and suggestions out we obviously will

544
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:09,870
have to raise things like that and kind

545
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:13,720
of yes I agree very much with Jeff that

546
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:16,659
in the end for for really making sure

547
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:21,190
that the a s path information we are

548
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:25,510
using we would need BGP SEC and I always

549
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:30,120
hate people who are doing the the

550
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:36,910
bad-mouthing of the BGP SEC expectancies

551
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:40,870
but well ok kind of there are there are

552
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:44,050
details were kind of if you want to use

553
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:47,379
certain properties of your policies and

554
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:49,899
the technology you have to you have to

555
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,820
correlate with other parts of your

556
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:57,310
operation

557
00:30:51,820 --> 00:31:00,550
and for the RPL for vir our question yes

558
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:04,629
are PSL is behind and it will never

559
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:09,610
catch up after there is no possibility

560
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:15,340
to do that it's 20 years old actually

561
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:23,320
bad design even then and you cannot you

562
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:25,929
cannot fix it really get over it you

563
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:29,290
still can you make some use out of

564
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:35,050
what's there but it is not going to

565
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:40,420
really help hello engineer Netflix I

566
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:44,530
have a question regarding ASPA it's sort

567
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:48,100
of the solving the past validation but

568
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:50,200
they want to have a better understanding

569
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:54,370
of the context like the progress we are

570
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:58,270
making and practical challenges as a

571
00:31:54,370 --> 00:32:01,239
community like what the options we can

572
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:07,379
contribute and help solve they push this

573
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:11,830
forward in a way SBA is a

574
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:15,910
reinterpretation of a SPF based filters

575
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:19,510
that have existed for years and then in

576
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:23,080
recent years I started branding certain

577
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:25,690
a spam filters as pure lock if you go to

578
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:28,540
peer locked up nets you can review that

579
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:30,160
presentation and the downside of this

580
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:32,260
peer lock concept is that it's a

581
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,700
manually driven operation we need to

582
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,400
email each other we need to call each

583
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:39,760
other to instruct each other how it is

584
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,430
we want other people's routers to be

585
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,330
configured what is an acceptable state

586
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:47,620
of the network

587
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:51,189
what is leaks or hijacks and ASPA is an

588
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:54,310
attempt to publish the type of

589
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:58,410
information where we that we manually

590
00:32:54,310 --> 00:33:00,550
exchange at this moment but do so in a

591
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:02,010
programmatic way that is

592
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:06,049
cryptographically for

593
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:13,110
so think of ASPA as peer lock rules

594
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:15,330
automated published in our PGI now there

595
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:18,870
are some challenges with this approach

596
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:23,309
where it's not immediately clear to me

597
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:26,699
if the published information described

598
00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:30,809
using the ASPA format can be correctly

599
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:35,190
used in all contexts so publishing

600
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:38,700
certain things via the RPK without being

601
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:43,139
sure that they can contribute to two

602
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:46,620
filters in any and all instances is a

603
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:49,379
challenge and the cider ups working

604
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:52,860
group in the ITF is it's the group of

605
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:56,340
people that are covering the ASPA drafts

606
00:33:52,860 --> 00:34:01,139
and they ultimately and this includes me

607
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:03,240
myself I'm co-author of the draft we

608
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:11,279
need to figure out can this actually

609
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:13,949
work in the global use case so it's on

610
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,139
their way it's it's something we need to

611
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:20,009
experiment with with something we need

612
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,419
to to actually write some software to

613
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:24,750
see if we can extract this information

614
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:30,029
and transform it into router conflicts

615
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:31,800
that are beneficial and we need help we

616
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:34,109
need feedback we need input we need

617
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,919
people that look at this and say I'm

618
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:39,779
willing to try I I can fry it software I

619
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,230
can write router conflicts

620
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,659
that's the states where we end we're

621
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:48,719
engineering it as we speak

622
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:51,240
thank you so with you know their

623
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:54,560
negative 30 seconds Tony Talbert comcast

624
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:57,930
so I would a good presentation and

625
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,310
offering and what's maybe for the next

626
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:03,839
presentation or how do you see it

627
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:07,170
playing for route leaks like what would

628
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,700
be the set of analogous things or how

629
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,670
would how would you do it differently

630
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,879
for route leagues

631
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:15,349
suddenly I think through maybe

632
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,089
ultimately we from a technical

633
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:20,869
perspective cannot really differentiate

634
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:24,440
between a route leak and hijack the BGP

635
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:26,529
protocol does not in itself carry a lot

636
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:28,849
of information to conclude whether

637
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:31,510
update was fabricated or not

638
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:34,630
so what helps against route leaks

639
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:38,779
specifically maximum prefix limits oh

640
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:42,490
right no way in terms of the operational

641
00:35:38,779 --> 00:35:44,539
workflow to operationally address them I

642
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:47,029
see that's what I'm talking I guess

643
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:50,079
that's a topic for our next presentation

644
00:35:47,029 --> 00:35:52,480
no thanks

645
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,650
all right there Jason budding Bisco

646
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,789
great talk I just had comment among

647
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:59,960
workflow right and perhaps something

648
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:02,630
that sort of would go in the beginning

649
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,789
of onboarding your customers or doing

650
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:07,640
the provisioning process right you have

651
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:09,920
maybe trained your folks to reach out

652
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,118
and to these folks at your onboarding

653
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,010
and saying say hey you're gonna renounce

654
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,500
these routes do you have rows for them

655
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:18,920
right and also maybe a message out to

656
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,900
the to the RRS to say when you're doing

657
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,089
your maybe your annual POC validations

658
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,170
saying we should take a look at this you

659
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:25,849
don't say wait a minute you have these

660
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:30,049
resources do you why you I did not put

661
00:36:25,849 --> 00:36:34,130
your rows out there thank you for that

662
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:36,519
suggestion I I'll propose to the PC how

663
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:39,609
to UM bar customers for the next time
