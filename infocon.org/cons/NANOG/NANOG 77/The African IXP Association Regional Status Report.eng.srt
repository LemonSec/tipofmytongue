1
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,420
morning everybody let me take a second

2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,330
to figure out there

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:24,360
clicker yeah okay right so good morning

4
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,159
everybody my name is Kyle Spencer I'm

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,220
gonna give you guys a brief talk about

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,960
the state of Africa's internet exchange

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,610
point industry and echo system this is

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,640
my first nanog so I'll spend a minute

9
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,980
just briefly introducing myself I am a

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,600
director for the executive director of

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,099
the Uganda internet exchange I'm also

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,490
representing here for example the

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,870
African IXP Association and by through

14
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,829
that I'm on the board of the internet

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,809
exchange Federation I'm also on the side

16
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,670
working to try to develop the regional

17
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,860
multiplayer internet gaming echo system

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,670
in Africa so if anybody's interested in

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,200
that please catch me on the sidelines so

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,460
the African internet exchange

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,649
Association is what you would expect

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,449
it's a group of regional internet

23
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:17,009
exchange point operators collaborating

24
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,479
for mutual benefit our we're a member of

25
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,400
the internet exchange Federation which I

26
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,140
briefly mentioned before so that's a

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,370
collection of Euro IX Lac IX f IX API X

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,799
as far as I'm aware North America

29
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,780
doesn't have an IX Association but if

30
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,670
there's any rumblings of one please let

31
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,210
me know

32
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,710
we were launched in 2012 at the Africa

33
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,919
peering and interconnection forum in

34
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,470
Johannesburg we currently have 45

35
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,040
internet exchange points in the African

36
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,150
region in 41 cities and 33 countries so

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,409
there's a number of countries that now

38
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:52,799
have more than one and sometimes

39
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,840
provided by competing operators we host

40
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,760
biannual meetings at the Africa internet

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,530
summit and the Africa peering and

42
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,110
interconnection forum which we organize

43
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,320
and host every year our next meeting is

44
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,850
going to be in Rwanda so please join us

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,699
if you're interested in the region and

46
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,579
internet exchanges and peering it's a

47
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,500
meeting much like this and of course we

48
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:15,030
also research a published data about our

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,129
region and that's some of what I'm going

50
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,260
to show you today our region in

51
00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:21,409
particular over the past ten years has

52
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:24,149
experienced some rather extreme

53
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:25,829
transitions in growth and so what we try

54
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,709
to do through this benchmark survey that

55
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,250
we issue to our members is try to get a

56
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,420
sense

57
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:36,180
of what the trends are and so we've been

58
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,459
doing this since about 2015 and then we

59
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,120
had some good data from before that in

60
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,160
2008 that you'll see throughout this

61
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,170
presentation and we generally get about

62
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,750
a 65 percent response rate so there's

63
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,489
definitely some margin of error we get a

64
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,550
different mixture of responses each year

65
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:55,740
and we've also incorporated some

66
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,530
third-party sources to try to fill in

67
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:02,280
some gaps that we had between 2008 and

68
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:05,580
2015 when we started doing this so this

69
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,790
chart shows the number of exchanges

70
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:11,720
overall in Africa starting from 1996

71
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:15,019
when Jenks was launched in South Africa

72
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:18,300
you can see for a long time until around

73
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:20,880
2010 or 11 there was some growth but

74
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,280
things really picked up when we started

75
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,690
organizing the Africa peering and

76
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,060
interconnection forum and then the

77
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,650
Internet Society in the Africa Union got

78
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,010
involved in developing internet

79
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:36,420
exchanges around 2012 through the Aphex

80
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:39,030
sorry access project this chart shows

81
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:42,570
the traffic you can see it's been a

82
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:44,850
pretty steep climb in 2008 when Machuca

83
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:47,160
did a survey of our region we only had

84
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,620
160 megabits going through all exchanges

85
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,609
in Africa in the region and today by our

86
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,830
conservative estimates we have over 700

87
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,110
gigabits and it's likely much higher

88
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,250
than that right now

89
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,470
you can see there's a couple different

90
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,880
data sets this is it's hard to actually

91
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,859
get a figure of what these are

92
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,170
so that was manually collected data in

93
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,510
the green on the left the blue is data

94
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,268
collected by the European internet

95
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,730
exchange Association which we're very

96
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:16,350
grateful for and you can see that

97
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,478
there's a discrepancy for example in

98
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,609
2015 between our data and theirs and

99
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,890
just to kind of illustrate some of the

100
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:25,409
challenges we face in capturing data

101
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,909
accurately the the difference there was

102
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,169
that we did not have an exchange in our

103
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,970
data that was being used as an

104
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:31,140
international gateway by one of the

105
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,340
countries in our region and so that

106
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,510
accounted for a huge amount of traffic

107
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,849
so this is the distribution of traffic

108
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,800
you can see that approximately half of

109
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:42,570
internet exchanges carry less than one

110
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,120
gigabit per second that's the bottom

111
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,000
green

112
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,889
and then as you go up increasing levels

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,980
of traffic so there are some exchanges

114
00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:53,020
that are disproportionately larger in

115
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,540
terms of traffic volume but in small

116
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:59,380
numbers the largest in our sample in

117
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:04,540
2018 was 480 gigabits which right now is

118
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,979
is actually much larger than that so

119
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,300
things are growing fast this is the

120
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:08,800
aggregate number of connections to

121
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,120
exchanges in the region of course this

122
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,669
is also going up into the right we

123
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:16,870
didn't have any data between 2009 and

124
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:19,120
2014 the more interesting bit here is

125
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,400
the distribution so approximately half

126
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,070
of exchanges had between 10 and 50

127
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,500
connections which is is quite good

128
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,540
despite the the low traffic levels

129
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,250
because I think that shows some

130
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,290
potential for growth because when you

131
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,669
have a lot of connections and a SNS and

132
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:37,410
in exchange that's what in my view

133
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:40,359
creates gravity and then more will come

134
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,100
the largest had 302 so we've got an

135
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,260
exchange in the region that has over 300

136
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,910
connections and that's that's generally

137
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:50,560
the num the number of networks they have

138
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:52,690
not ports so it's quite large the

139
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,550
membership distribution in the region

140
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,650
has changed significantly over the last

141
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,630
approximately 10 years in the old days

142
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,049
when internet exchanges were in their

143
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:04,120
infancy in our region we had a lot of

144
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,979
ISPs well almost exclusively ISPs

145
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,020
connected to internet exchanges and now

146
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:09,880
today you can see that we've got a very

147
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,760
healthy mixture of mobile network

148
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,919
operators content networks academic

149
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:19,300
networks banking and other enterprise

150
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:21,609
and as a result governance models have

151
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,349
had to evolve as well in the early days

152
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,270
it made sense to have IX

153
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,310
ISP a internet service provider

154
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,450
association run the internet exchange

155
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,950
points because they were the only guys

156
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:33,219
connected they were the only major

157
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,599
networks in town that's the blue but

158
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,700
then over time that model became

159
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:38,800
unrepresentative as the diversity of the

160
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,380
membership increased and so you started

161
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,690
to see more neutral nonprofit internet

162
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,520
exchanges which is in the red and then

163
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,289
over time other types of exchanges like

164
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,930
government-run exchanges in the yellow

165
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:51,820
and for-profit exchanges as we call them

166
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,289
in the dark red and when I say

167
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,240
for-profit in the context of this

168
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:56,169
presentation what I mean is a data

169
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,270
center that

170
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:00,789
owns and operates in exchange as the

171
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,919
exchange itself is not for profit it

172
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:05,789
might be offered for free but it's owned

173
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:09,729
and operated by a for-profit Colo

174
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:12,639
provider so we tried to dig into the

175
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,289
data and actually figure out some other

176
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,120
interesting statistics related to this

177
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:18,909
and we noted that government-run

178
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,939
internet exchanges had the lowest annual

179
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:25,050
growth rates by far on average 91

180
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:26,979
megabits growth per year and one network

181
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,639
on the opposite side of the spectrum

182
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:33,909
these for-profit IXP Colo model

183
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,379
exchanges were the most we're

184
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:41,110
experiencing the most rapid growth at

185
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:42,759
around 20 gigs per year internet

186
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,270
exchanges in Africa are formalizing

187
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:48,580
we've got about 75% of them now that

188
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:52,150
require contracts to join that was not

189
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,859
the case not too long ago and some even

190
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:57,279
offer service level agreements although

191
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,860
that's still a minority in terms of

192
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,599
service fees what you'll find in the

193
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,860
region is that a growing number of

194
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,930
internet exchanges have implemented

195
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,539
sustainability models or commercial

196
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,370
models depending on their context in the

197
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:10,449
chart on the left you can see in dark

198
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,879
green that's the number of exchanges

199
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:15,399
that are charging fees starting in 2015

200
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,169
on the left and then the light green is

201
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:18,729
the ones that plan to charge fees at the

202
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:20,378
time that we conducted that survey and

203
00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:22,389
then the gray area our exchanges that

204
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:25,089
had no plans to charge fees and those

205
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,259
were typically the for-profit exchanges

206
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:28,599
that were offered as a free exchange

207
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:30,550
service by a for-profit Cola provider

208
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:32,429
they didn't need to charge fees because

209
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:35,110
they made it up on the Rackspace and

210
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:37,390
most exchanges are charging port fees

211
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,729
but a lot of them also charge annual

212
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,979
membership fees and some still operate

213
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:43,659
only on membership fees but we see that

214
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:47,649
evolving towards a poor fee model

215
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:49,569
because that's a bit more scalable a lot

216
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:52,269
of internet exchanges in our region rely

217
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:53,920
on donations of course about sixty

218
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:55,480
percent receive recurring donations

219
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,349
typically in the form of Rackspace

220
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,209
internet transit and power some also get

221
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:05,220
donated legal services and payroll

222
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:05,219
depending on their their funding model

223
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,430
the hardware donations are typically

224
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:14,029
switches servers power equipment what

225
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:15,920
you'd might expect and also I it's worth

226
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:17,420
mentioning that 20% of IXPs have

227
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,969
received grant funding in the last 12

228
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,290
months so there's still a lot of active

229
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,640
donor funding to try to develop the

230
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:26,449
internet exchange echo system in our

231
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,430
region so this is the peering policy

232
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,589
over time at internet exchanges in our

233
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,229
region so on the left you have 2008 and

234
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:35,209
there's kind of a big jump to 2015 but

235
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,310
what this shows is is whether you're

236
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,959
gonna be forced to peer with all other

237
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,969
networks at the exchange or whether you

238
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,550
can bilaterally peer or if they offer

239
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:46,880
route servers etc so in the orange on

240
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:49,040
the left back in 2008 that's mandatory

241
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,350
multilateral peering so if you showed up

242
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,060
in an exchange point in 2008 in Africa

243
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,230
there was a good chance that you were

244
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,329
gonna be forced to appear with all the

245
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,010
other networks which of course as we

246
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,660
know discourages networks from coming in

247
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,730
the first place and I think people

248
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,100
discover that over time and what we've

249
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,380
seen in the green is that multilateral

250
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,209
peering policies at exchanges one out in

251
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,010
other words you can connect to the

252
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:11,750
exchange we've got a route server for

253
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,279
you but you can also just bilaterally

254
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,740
peer with whoever you want it's up to

255
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,079
you and so thankfully we've seen that

256
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,449
model take off over time we still do

257
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,250
have some layer three exchanges in the

258
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:25,430
region which are router in the middle

259
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:28,790
instead of switch but we're trying to

260
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,260
hammer them down there's a lot of

261
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,140
exchanges now in our region that have

262
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,000
full-time paid staff which is a dramatic

263
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,380
difference from the past we haven't put

264
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,110
together graphs that show this stuff

265
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,790
over time but currently about half of

266
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:44,089
internet exchanges have full-time staff

267
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,829
and half are paid this is different

268
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:47,269
mixtures of each oddly even though you

269
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:50,380
would expect that all full-time staff

270
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:52,850
are paid that's not always the case

271
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,040
there's a lot of value added services

272
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,959
showing up at exchanges of course

273
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,569
network monitoring systems DNS root

274
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,099
servers are common now which is that's

275
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:03,560
exploded a lot there were there were

276
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,570
only about 25 percent of exchanges in

277
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:10,579
our region that had DNS root servers in

278
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:12,410
2008 and now there's about 66% but we've

279
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:13,670
also seen customer portals show up which

280
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,310
is a bit more advanced

281
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:18,500
thanks to software like IXP manager

282
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:22,699
which INEX and the guys over in island

283
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:25,430
together the facilities are getting

284
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:29,300
better and more neutral so this slide

285
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:30,859
shows the in the blue the neutrality of

286
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,890
the facilities that internet exchanges

287
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,950
are in back in 2008 a lot of these

288
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,480
internet exchanges were in carrier

289
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,770
facilities for example because there

290
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,200
just weren't a lot of carrier neutral

291
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,819
DC's or other wise neutral facilities

292
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,290
that they could go in so if they were in

293
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,770
neutral facilities they tended to be in

294
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:50,089
like a broom closet somewhere or the

295
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,189
government might have offered space in

296
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,870
their building but as you can see over

297
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:57,590
time facilities that we consider

298
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,510
reliably neutral have increased and the

299
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,640
number of explicitly non neutral

300
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,160
facilities typically carrier owned have

301
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,319
decreased and you can see the breakdown

302
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,880
on the right so in the blue of course on

303
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,320
the right you've got carry digital DC

304
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,930
and then the lighter blue is our

305
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,670
academic and then IXP owned facilities

306
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,680
because in some cases they they rent

307
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,380
their own themselves the red is the

308
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,870
carriers and the gray or ones that we're

309
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,980
not really sure of the neutrality so but

310
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,540
still your mileage may vary

311
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,920
you could be in a market where there's a

312
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,800
carrier neutral DC with an exchange

313
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,240
inside but you might have a non neutral

314
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,680
Metro fiber situation or whatever so

315
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,860
there's still a lot of tricks to getting

316
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,540
to exchanges in some cases facilities

317
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,010
are improving of course as people move

318
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,780
into better facilities and carry neutral

319
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,430
DC's pop up in the region more fire

320
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:43,339
suppression video surveillance security

321
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:47,150
etc so your kit is safer than ever these

322
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:49,400
days and and that's it that's just a

323
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,740
broad overview of what's going on in our

324
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,390
region so if anybody's interested I have

325
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,580
time for questions I think I move

326
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,449
through that quite quickly or you can

327
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,450
catch me on the sidelines

328
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:12,689
no questions all right thank you very

329
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,689
much

330
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:20,709
you
