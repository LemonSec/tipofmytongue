1
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:22,640
you turn a little bit this way not much

2
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:26,869
Houston looking out at the bright lights

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,690
so I good afternoon we got the vaunted

4
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:32,689
post lunch nap slot but I hope we can

5
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,660
keep this entertaining enough to keep

6
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:39,769
everyone awake one thing I wanted to do

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:41,809
just as we open and talk about this you

8
00:00:39,769 --> 00:00:45,500
know the the title of the panel is the

9
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:47,750
next network professional last week the

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,210
community lost someone who was

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,220
incredibly passionate about what we're

12
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,080
about to talk about which is themed

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:56,120
around diversity and inclusion in the

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,629
industry and so you know it's with

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,540
sadness that Bryn Fowler passed away she

16
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:05,539
was passionate in the women's technical

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,240
forum organization as well as pretty

18
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:21,310
involved here in nanog so just a moment

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:25,669
for her thank you

20
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:28,880
so we're gonna use move around a couple

21
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:31,340
terms a lot in this panel and I want to

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,899
make sure because many of us are either

23
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,340
technologists or used to be

24
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:37,280
technologists or hope to be

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,320
technologists or adjacent technologists

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,369
and so we don't talk about these things

27
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:46,898
a lot and so there are two words

28
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:49,520
diversity and inclusion and some people

29
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:51,020
lump those together like I just did

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,270
right we talk about diversity inclusion

31
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,658
almost all the time together there are

32
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:59,929
two very different things and at netflix

33
00:01:56,659 --> 00:02:02,119
we actually have a VP of inclusion named

34
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:03,770
Vern a Myers who's been in that industry

35
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,439
for a very long time she's got a great

36
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,299
book highly recommend you read it but

37
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,190
the easiest way to describe the

38
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,270
difference between the two is that

39
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:16,579
diversity is being invited to the party

40
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,340
and inclusion is being asked to dance at

41
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,770
the party so it's a light-hearted way to

42
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:25,250
think about it but try to frame when we

43
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,870
talk about that in those those bars so

44
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,880
with that what I want to do is introduce

45
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,210
our panelists and we'll just start from

46
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,370
the end of the stage and come this way

47
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,980
Edward can you tell us who you are where

48
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,920
do you work and how did you get here

49
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,239
and when I say here I don't mean how did

50
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,739
you get to nanog I don't mean how did

51
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,980
you fly here I don't mean how did you

52
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:48,800
get this job in particular but why are

53
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,720
you here in your career so I'm Edward

54
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,490
McNair I'm the executive director of

55
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,590
Nanak I currently live in Portland

56
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:00,290
Oregon but in the question of how I got

57
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:03,380
where I am I think that it would say

58
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,929
that it was curiosity that drove me I

59
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,180
was a little

60
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,100
I'm little on the older side and I

61
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:14,060
realized I remember the day that it

62
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:17,380
happened I was a men's suit manager for

63
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:20,840
Nordstrom's and I was walking out of the

64
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:26,209
store down the street and I saw a sign

65
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:28,850
that said PCs PC Klum's 95% compatible

66
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:32,150
and then I suddenly realized this was

67
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:34,790
not a fad that this was gonna be real it

68
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,770
was going to be everywhere and that's

69
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:40,010
what I decided to make a shift in moving

70
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:42,110
toward technology I was talking to one

71
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,260
of my children once and I said we were

72
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:47,480
in an auto mechanic shop and getting our

73
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,640
car serviced and they had all these

74
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,390
stations with PCs sitting around them

75
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,309
and I said we never imagined this when I

76
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,458
was your age that you would walk in and

77
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:01,640
see computer stations all around so that

78
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:03,140
was the the moment was there a person or

79
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,019
a group of people who you can point to

80
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:11,059
that said this person made your career

81
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:12,620
possible yeah there was a gentleman that

82
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,260
I used to work with by the name of Bill

83
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,000
May and it was when I first got when I

84
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,579
in my career starting to work into the

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,600
computer industry and he was one of the

86
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:26,270
greatest bosses I ever had he just was

87
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,600
encouraging he gave me the room to fall

88
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:31,820
and falter and make mistakes and was

89
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,360
always afterwards okay so what did we

90
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,210
learn and

91
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,440
it was just inspired me to always work

92
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,900
harder and do better Thank You Roger

93
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,360
great so I'm Nigel Maude I'm part of the

94
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,489
network team at Facebook so support all

95
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,110
the networking efforts interiors that

96
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:53,699
build a network for Facebook properties

97
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,800
my journey has been interesting where I

98
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,810
started out as a network person and I'm

99
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,699
still a network person and I think I'm

100
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:05,490
gonna end at a network person early days

101
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,110
in college I started looking at routing

102
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,960
and writing was relatively new at that

103
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,509
time and I just got addicted to so the

104
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,479
distributed nature of how routing worked

105
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:17,280
and since then have been really

106
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:19,469
intrigued by that and I've had the

107
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,020
opportunity to spend a lot of time in

108
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:23,699
places where a lot of the routing

109
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,430
technologies were developed early days

110
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,440
of you ned and places like that that was

111
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,199
really it's really interesting actually

112
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,229
somebody who just walked in and gave me

113
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:38,639
a big that coming in is the job I took

114
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:42,750
when he left you unit so and that was to

115
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,810
be the peering coordinator for for you

116
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,150
unit our 701 or so and that's sort of

117
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:51,240
how I got into the network industry and

118
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:55,258
I've just been addicted since then has

119
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,449
evolved the ton and you know just trying

120
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:59,159
to pay a small part in the evolution of

121
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:01,259
where the network industry is and where

122
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:03,539
the network is going and is there a

123
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:07,460
person or a group of people I think it's

124
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:11,310
it's a group of people I've really had

125
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:14,279
really good luck in landing in places

126
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,050
where it's been fun to actually go

127
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:18,300
experiment and try different things

128
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,969
my first thing out of college was

129
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,560
writing frame relay code and somebody

130
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:25,259
handed me a frame relay and an ice pack

131
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,819
and say hey go have fun and didn't know

132
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,259
what I was doing and there was a lot of

133
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,020
help and it was just kind of learning

134
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,990
experience it was okay to fail and then

135
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:36,419
the unit experience was similar that we

136
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,039
were essentially inventing things as we

137
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:41,068
went along I mean we were talking at

138
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,719
lunch earlier I remember what MPLS was

139
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:45,620
being talked about and pls didn't

140
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:46,760
existed it was developed in the hallways

141
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,430
and it was just really the fun

142
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,289
conversations to have to take a problem

143
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,330
and how do you solve it and I've just

144
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,790
been lucky enough to be around those

145
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,260
situations where a lot of passionate

146
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,870
people who are trying to solve hard

147
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:03,560
problems yes and that's been the key for

148
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,460
me on how my career has gone thank you

149
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,040
jack

150
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:12,469
i'm jack waters i help lead a company

151
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:18,530
called Zao if you could guess gosh how

152
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:21,260
did I get here I got here in 1985 and a

153
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:24,859
bit of a defining moment I know for many

154
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:28,630
of you it's that's unheard of but I was

155
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:32,030
an intern at a lab a government lab and

156
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:34,729
I was I think a junior in college I was

157
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:37,900
a UNIX systems administrator a VAX

158
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:43,699
11 cb7 85 if you remember what that was

159
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:47,929
and the thing that dawned on me was that

160
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:51,229
I could send an email to the person

161
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:53,990
sitting next to me just as easily as I

162
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:58,700
could send an email to somebody at UCL

163
00:07:53,990 --> 00:08:01,870
in London and that was a very defining

164
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:05,690
moment if you think back then that was

165
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:09,050
right after 80 was broken up two years

166
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:11,150
later modified final judgment the notion

167
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,370
of long distance and local calling was

168
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,690
still like in everyone's mind if you

169
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,220
were a kid at that time you worried

170
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:19,990
about making a long-distance call on

171
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:25,520
your parents phone and and to be able to

172
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:27,680
have this boundary list thing sitting in

173
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,760
front of me was was fascinating and I

174
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,459
just I mean I got cooked and you know I

175
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,630
see bill Norton and and of Sean Kennedy

176
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:39,439
and a few other folks that have been

177
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:44,088
around as long as I have and you know

178
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,610
this conference wasn't called nanog this

179
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:49,730
was called the NSFNET regional text

180
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:52,670
meeting and in 94 we were sitting around

181
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:55,280
at the US West Advanced Technology

182
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,199
Center and decided well that's not very

183
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,480
inclusive anymore we wanted to have it

184
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,930
much broader than the answer

185
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,390
at regional text and so we named it Anna

186
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,890
with mark nopper and a few other Tom

187
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:09,939
Easterday and a few other folks in the

188
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:12,790
room so Elise gerich so I mean that's

189
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:16,450
kinda that's kind of how I got here and

190
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:18,730
I've been a part of a lot of fun things

191
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,800
along the way building you know I think

192
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,720
on response personally responsible for

193
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,699
more traffic jams the United States than

194
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,410
any other human to build a ton of

195
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,940
network and you know it's been a really

196
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,100
special thing and I love coming here and

197
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:37,090
seeing so many new people being involved

198
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:40,020
the defining person for me I'd say the

199
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:44,110
two sets the first is the group of

200
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:47,530
network engineers in the late 80s that

201
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:50,110
really was less than 50 people it really

202
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:54,189
was you know the very beginning of all

203
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:58,330
this and those folks I I still interact

204
00:09:54,190 --> 00:10:00,700
with NASA a lawar who's on on the

205
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:04,240
Facebook team he and I always joke about

206
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:06,040
him sending he was just he had just come

207
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,840
into the country and sending a broken

208
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,660
English emails to everybody for a

209
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,970
maintenances the second person has been

210
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,430
Cerf I was lucky enough to work for vent

211
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:20,370
for a number of years and you know

212
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:24,430
really very special person great person

213
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:26,950
Levi so my name is Levi pare go I'm

214
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:31,810
full-time faculty at the University of

215
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:34,960
Colorado I do research and teach classes

216
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,790
and network engineering and kind of for

217
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,400
this group the classes of that I teach I

218
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,740
teach a network on a software-defined

219
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,689
networking class and a Sdn

220
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:48,070
virtualization and orchestration class

221
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:50,370
and so one of the things kind of the

222
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,660
topic the nest next network professional

223
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:56,260
one of the things kind of indicating

224
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,110
where we're headed is we were in the

225
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,220
master's program called ITP

226
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,500
interdisciplinary telecom program and

227
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,020
now all of our network engineering has

228
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:07,030
shifted to computer science and so

229
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:11,770
that's kind of an indication of where

230
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:12,130
we're going how I got here so my kind of

231
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,079
row

232
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,750
to academia is is not the traditional

233
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,270
one at all I I was a senior network

234
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:22,840
engineer and managing a technical

235
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:25,480
support team my ad Tran and from there I

236
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:28,060
decided you know I was a traditional

237
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,650
network engineer router jockey kind of

238
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,790
like a lot of a lot of people in here

239
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:36,130
but one of one of my focuses is I moved

240
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:39,490
to academia kind of for two main reasons

241
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:41,470
one is just the continued learning right

242
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,350
in academia you're you're forced to

243
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,580
learn new technologies and not only do

244
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,740
you have to learn these technologies I

245
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,540
got to learn them I have to create a lab

246
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,280
on them that are going to be taught to

247
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,770
students that this is going to be their

248
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,990
full-time job so you have to learn brand

249
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:58,540
new technologies really in-depth so I

250
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:01,210
like that aspect of learning brand new

251
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:05,439
technologies and working really hard on

252
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:07,270
complex problems so you know at a dream

253
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,780
when I was a you know network engineer I

254
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:12,640
was solving current problems one of the

255
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,990
things I like in academia is we're

256
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,750
trying to solve problems that may not

257
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:19,090
exist yet so I really like this idea of

258
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,800
working hard and trying to work on

259
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,380
complex problems and see where the

260
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,390
future of networking may go and the

261
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,939
other reason I'm kind of where I am

262
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:30,970
today is you know as cliche as it may be

263
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:33,610
it's the students right we we really get

264
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,430
to make an impact on on what they do and

265
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,810
what they choose for their career and

266
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,900
you know unlike a lot of the people up

267
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:43,030
here they may get one or two first-round

268
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,340
draft picks you know when they hire you

269
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,380
know I get 30 or 40 every year that I

270
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,300
get to continue to work with and and so

271
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,220
I really like you know working with the

272
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,900
students and working on the problems and

273
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,760
hopefully making a difference thank you

274
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,530
hi everyone

275
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,530
so I run product and engineering at

276
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,240
packet fabric and we are a next

277
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:07,660
generation fully automated network

278
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,840
service provider and a lot like nauseum

279
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:13,180
and Jack and Levi I've been working in

280
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,190
the network field for quite a long time

281
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:19,479
I think I got my first taste when I was

282
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:22,080
a kid on my dad's friends computer just

283
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,800
using right to talk to my dad who was

284
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,130
back at home when

285
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,439
I was away up in the mountains just

286
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:31,029
using right on the UNIX command line to

287
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,190
talk to him and it blew my mind that it

288
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:35,170
was possible to actually talk to

289
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,700
somebody over a phone line especially

290
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:39,339
one that made a bunch of weird

291
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,500
screeching noises and then when I was

292
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:44,019
when I was 14 someone was dumb enough to

293
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,630
entrust me with running and managing a

294
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:48,220
frame relay network at a bank so I got

295
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:51,060
into that and then eventually I fell

296
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:53,560
more into the software side of things

297
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,839
learned a lot about a software

298
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:57,459
engineering and then the two sort of met

299
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,230
and that's what I've been doing since

300
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:02,018
there's a lot of automation on top of

301
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:04,779
networks and I'm not sure that I could

302
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:07,390
point to a particular person but I can

303
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:09,070
certainly like point to a lot of people

304
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,890
along the way who helped me in my career

305
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,360
it was probably those you know the the

306
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,010
IT manager at the bank that first

307
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,290
started you know that first decided to

308
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,630
hire me and then there was an incredibly

309
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,089
great group of executives that I worked

310
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:27,070
with at Tara Mark who many of them were

311
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:29,110
my mentors the CTO there the CEO were

312
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,060
just great people and they were really

313
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,700
inspiring and encouraged me on my career

314
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:36,430
path thank you

315
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:39,670
and I'm Dave Temkin I've been at Netflix

316
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:42,579
- a short period where I left when I

317
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,140
first started as a just a man and

318
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:47,290
network engineering manager I've been in

319
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,660
Netflix for about 11 years now and I've

320
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,959
seen that company grow from just

321
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:55,630
slinging DVDs to now 150 million plus

322
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,089
streaming customers and it's been it's

323
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,850
been a wild ride for sure

324
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:02,320
you know before that I had you know I've

325
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,490
been in the dot-com space for a little

326
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,920
while and before that I was in the

327
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:09,640
financial space but when I first started

328
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,219
my career I was actually 15 and a half I

329
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,350
say this because I couldn't drive to

330
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,000
this job for the first six months I had

331
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:20,500
to go with a friend who got me the job

332
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,730
and the job was a co-op position while I

333
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,829
was still in high school at

334
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:27,040
bristol-myers Squibb pharmaceutical

335
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:28,890
company and he saw something in me he

336
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,319
was a year and a half older than me

337
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:35,230
and we had met on the local BBS scene in

338
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,940
the Philadelphia area and he convinced

339
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,400
his boss to bring in for an internship

340
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:41,980
and then for a co-op his boss was this

341
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,900
guy named Chris Baldwin who I don't know

342
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:48,520
why he put up with my but he did

343
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:50,319
and I first put me in helpdesk and those

344
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,390
of you who know me can imagine how well

345
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,160
that went

346
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:56,290
and so then they're like maybe you know

347
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,390
you seem like you've got potential here

348
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,890
so let's find something else this

349
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:03,640
network stuff you don't really have to

350
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:05,920
talk to people so they moved me to

351
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:10,000
network and I just took to it you know

352
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,860
like just completely overnight and Chris

353
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,600
stuck with me Chris brought me back for

354
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,740
a co-op every year while I was still in

355
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,960
high school and then gave me a job

356
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,640
straight out of high school and so I can

357
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,830
definitively point to Chris and the

358
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:25,600
person who introduced us as why I'm here

359
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:27,580
today I wanted to also you know I want

360
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,470
to recognize something so Anna was nice

361
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,080
enough when did I ping you Friday right

362
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,900
pinged her Friday afternoon and said hey

363
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,040
one of our panelists dropped out Gina

364
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,900
Hass Blair was supposed to be on the

365
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,120
panel with us today but her mom passed

366
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,530
away last week unfortunately and so she

367
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,840
was unable to be here this week and I

368
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:47,400
said hey I'd really like to get a

369
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:50,380
woman's perspective on this panel and

370
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:51,160
what happened was i pinged jack a pang

371
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,410
nauseam

372
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,819
I said who else can we ask is one thing

373
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,459
that was really important to me was that

374
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,050
I found someone who had leadership

375
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:02,590
experience right who had who had

376
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:03,670
fostered and grown teams and I pinged

377
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,930
Anna and I was like what do you think

378
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:08,170
about this and she's like well I'll do

379
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:09,790
it I was like okay thank you Anna

380
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,730
why wasn't so hard for me to find a

381
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:16,089
woman to replace Gina because there are

382
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:20,170
not I mean look in the room women are

383
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:22,240
the minority here and as you move up the

384
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,100
food chain even further into management

385
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,710
and then executive management positions

386
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:29,290
there becomes fewer and fewer women in

387
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:32,430
those positions so I would have given

388
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:36,190
David another suggestion had I had one

389
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:39,730
fair enough people like to throw around

390
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:40,820
the term pipeline problem and I want to

391
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,320
get everyone's

392
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,120
you know those who want to contribute to

393
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,189
it your thoughts around that and I'm

394
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,929
going to start again with Anna because

395
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:52,610
you and I specifically talked about that

396
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:58,010
as a problem of problems and why is that

397
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:59,629
term so problematic so the biggest

398
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:03,920
problem with pipeline right is you can't

399
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:05,540
hire what's what isn't there and I work

400
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,190
with hiring across our network

401
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,040
engineering teams data center

402
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,630
engineering infrastructure software

403
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,159
system reliability and engineering

404
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:16,220
network reliability engineering right

405
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:19,040
there's a big pile of resumes we have

406
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,690
for a lot of open positions and when you

407
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:26,810
look at the percentage of women in there

408
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:28,880
it's around 10 percent maybe it's it's

409
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:32,120
usually a single-digit percentile right

410
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,520
and so if you want to achieve any sort

411
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,679
of mass and hiring you know in hiring

412
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,170
women you just can't do it you can't

413
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,520
hire the people that aren't there and

414
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,960
everything that I've read about it

415
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,810
indicates that the pipeline problems

416
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,100
happen at like several different stages

417
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:48,530
they happen in middle school high school

418
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,240
and college and sort of an average stage

419
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:52,700
you get more and more women that are

420
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,110
filtered out of either network

421
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,420
engineering or software engineering

422
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,850
because they don't think it's a woman's

423
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,260
career or just don't believe that it's

424
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:04,250
right for them instead of be encouraged

425
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:05,300
to to keep on going so when you're

426
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,190
dealing with all these different levels

427
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,350
of filtering and you know narrowing down

428
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,060
more and more so you have a very small

429
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,889
pool of people to start with and then

430
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:16,250
once you actually get into employment

431
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:18,050
there's things like you know a lot of

432
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,820
women just don't get the mentorship that

433
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:22,149
they need I was fortunate enough to have

434
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,530
that and then there's also things like

435
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:29,120
parental leave policies that influence

436
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:30,590
women staying in in the pipeline if you

437
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,090
want to call it so then by the time that

438
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,939
you get to executive management you're

439
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:37,520
left only with a very very few leave I

440
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,320
what what trends are you seeing yes so I

441
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,260
think we're a little on the on the up

442
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,010
side of this so in our graduate program

443
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:48,590
in network engineering we're 40% women

444
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:50,730
and of the of the five students we have

445
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:54,990
here today three of them are

446
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:57,180
are women so but but I also agree if the

447
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:01,890
students aren't there you can't select

448
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:05,310
them and we do not have a lot applying

449
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,990
for a master's program but the ones that

450
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,419
we do have applying are always

451
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,700
outstanding so I definitely think in

452
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,740
kind of grad school we're definitely

453
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,420
seeing this trend shift at least in the

454
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,880
engineering school at cu-boulder

455
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,260
so hopefully this will continue for sure

456
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,090
okay do you know if that's just didn't

457
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,070
see you Boulder or is it across academia

458
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,780
that were seem like so I don't know I

459
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,600
know that you know one of our kind of

460
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:30,210
focuses in the engineering school is you

461
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,659
know diversity both with gender and

462
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:35,310
everything so yeah I'm happy to say our

463
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:38,520
program is definitely 40 percent I can't

464
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:40,710
speak for the others yeah I kind of

465
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,860
agree that it feels a little bit on the

466
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:48,110
upswing if we look at our company in

467
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:51,689
Colorado we're about 45 percent female

468
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:55,169
55 percent male obviously and the it's I

469
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:58,170
think it's required us to be very

470
00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:00,930
intentional measuring making sure that

471
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:03,320
we're we're taking as many steps as we

472
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:07,850
can to be to be more intentional and

473
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:10,350
I've certainly seen in the past and and

474
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,780
but I do agree that the pipeline is

475
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:15,990
awfully thin at times and it's stuff

476
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,820
that's not you know at 45 percent is

477
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:24,840
across the whole company so it's not the

478
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:28,050
technical I I was in an off-site and

479
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,149
read the CEO of our company called me

480
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:32,580
out in front of all of our executive all

481
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:35,670
of our VPS of the company about 80 of

482
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:39,270
them and said Dave Temkin you have the

483
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,740
best ratio of women to men and all of

484
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,930
products and product encompasses

485
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:46,380
technology in Netflix how did you do it

486
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:47,940
and I was like I'm gonna take a pass on

487
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,670
answering this question let's talk about

488
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,140
this offline and he's like whoa I was

489
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,460
like yeah it's it's fine let's just talk

490
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,000
about this offline so we go offline and

491
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:59,190
I'm like if I look at my teens the women

492
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,930
on my teams or you know provisioners are

493
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,000
doing logistics or doing business

494
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,840
operations they're not on the technical

495
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
side there's a

496
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,299
you but it's not even remotely the same

497
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,980
ratio and I said you know I I feel he'll

498
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:12,360
called out here to some extent he wanted

499
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,520
it to be positive but it actually turned

500
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:19,049
into a negative so I'm in the same exact

501
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:21,629
space so I want to jump in a few things

502
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:24,500
that like what Jack was saying one be

503
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,700
intentional about driving the change

504
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,350
remember I started the conversation when

505
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:32,220
I'm a networked person now has been one

506
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:33,629
always be one no change it but it's one

507
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,130
of the things that that I'm starting to

508
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,960
become more passionate about if you

509
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:40,460
think about networks they're large-scale

510
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,380
distributed systems there are at least

511
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,450
double the number of women in software

512
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:48,750
engineering distributed system problem

513
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:50,760
space than in network itself roughly

514
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,830
fifteen percent is on network and thirty

515
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,059
percent is what software engineering can

516
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,520
we bring that work up to thirty percent

517
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:58,918
that will be a big game so one of the

518
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:02,340
things that I think we've been trying to

519
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:04,649
direct drive is not be very specifically

520
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:07,049
pigeon-holed boxed into a you're a

521
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:09,299
network person you're solving

522
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:12,418
large-scale distributed system problems

523
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:14,010
using software let's do that and what

524
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:16,289
you're doing is you're enhancing the

525
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:17,908
scope of people that are actually

526
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:19,860
interested in those those type of

527
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:20,309
problems and you bring those into the

528
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,799
fold

529
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:24,658
having engineers and a network

530
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,129
traditional networks are engineer and

531
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:28,590
engineers and software engineers working

532
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:31,440
together actually solving problems that

533
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:34,168
has helped a lot in those cases but then

534
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,120
also working on building the pipeline

535
00:23:34,169 --> 00:23:40,440
like one of the things we've done with

536
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:42,959
Levi and his university is build a

537
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:47,010
rotational engineering program where we

538
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:50,520
hire fresh graduates not more than maybe

539
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:52,890
two years of experience and our numbers

540
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,559
are better than Levi 60% women on that

541
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:58,440
program and we've already graduated 16

542
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:00,539
engineers out of that program and we're

543
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,520
continuing to add more headcount to it

544
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:06,240
and it's it's actually growing fairly

545
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:08,760
well the other thing that we started a

546
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,679
program that's not directly Network

547
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,559
engineering but feeding to our technical

548
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:16,169
program management side is what we call

549
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:17,379
return to work a lot of people

550
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:19,360
especially

551
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,030
take some time off during paternity

552
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,100
having kids or whatever it's really hard

553
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:27,070
to come back into a tech industry three

554
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,260
years later in technology has moved on

555
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,629
you're not in the same same phase so we

556
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:35,379
started this program where we would hire

557
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:38,080
people for a year sort of a let's try

558
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,669
this out help them through mentorship

559
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,840
through training programs through

560
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:43,480
projects and things like that

561
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,820
and at the end of the year we would make

562
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,580
a decision on yes this person will stay

563
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:52,539
or not and offer a full-time position

564
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:55,720
guess what the people actually staying

565
00:24:52,539 --> 00:25:00,549
is much much higher so we started with

566
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:01,030
16 people 14 got full-time offers 13 are

567
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:03,429
women

568
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,928
and it's awesome what though what is

569
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:06,520
your staff structuring that made that

570
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:08,559
happen I mean this is you it's saying

571
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,299
it's the deliberate intent what is the

572
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,928
staffing the structure that makes this

573
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:16,059
possible so the I'll be transparent and

574
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,740
say one of the advantage of Facebook is

575
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:19,389
that we don't need a lot of staffing

576
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,400
structure or approval processes and

577
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:24,850
things like that we get to go create

578
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,890
programs that we can actually find

579
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,299
ourselves like the rotational

580
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,909
engineering program that we started that

581
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:32,289
levy Lee Ryan and his team was

582
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:34,390
essentially there are a couple of people

583
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:36,520
that work out of our Boulder office

584
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,750
they've been they went to see you

585
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,460
Boulder and they were like hey we have

586
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,039
contact we want to go start this program

587
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,620
and we get the started now I have a

588
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:46,870
manager that manages their rotational

589
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,418
program engineering team and essentially

590
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:51,370
all teams support by mentoring and by

591
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:54,730
taking them on three-month rotation

592
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:56,830
you're working on projects so the the

593
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:59,200
trouble that I see a lot of times is in

594
00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:00,970
a lot of companies is organizational

595
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,429
where we need a lot of approval a lot of

596
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:06,130
processes a lot of things around it it

597
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:08,470
doesn't take that that stuff it really

598
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,030
takes two or three passionate people who

599
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,980
are passionate about solving this

600
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:14,080
problem or actually working on it and

601
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:17,409
you start start going and when you

602
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,840
actually see the the success you have

603
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:22,450
more people jumping in that's been my

604
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,309
experience yeah and I just want to jump

605
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,770
on it because I couldn't possibly agree

606
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:29,290
with more with what Naja masane as far

607
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,139
as like for whatever reason good or bad

608
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:32,750
network

609
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:36,080
the word Network seems to be repellent

610
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,760
to a lot of women and looking at it as

611
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,889
distributed systems it's actually how we

612
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,240
found some of our best people it's

613
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,040
looking for people to background in

614
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,920
manager managing like large-scale power

615
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:48,139
systems or just any other large-scale

616
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,910
systems because it's the same thing

617
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,210
sending a large system that has

618
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:55,370
real-world interaction and when we spoke

619
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,740
earlier I love that concept and I think

620
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:59,409
we're actually going to start using that

621
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:02,929
a little bit more in our job postings

622
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:05,960
and also to structuring the question of

623
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:08,390
structuring teams how we structure our

624
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:12,080
teams at packet fabric is we have this

625
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:13,730
concept of all of software sre and n

626
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,299
re-enter is what we call network

627
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:19,100
reliability engineering all homeroom

628
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:22,010
together meaning that they're all part

629
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:24,620
of the same core group and we all agree

630
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:27,049
on you know certain tools and certain

631
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,939
sets of rules of engagement whatever but

632
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:31,520
then for the most part the software

633
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:34,250
engineers or the reliability engineers

634
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,870
live breathe eat work sleep with the

635
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,480
teams that they're solving problems for

636
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:40,250
and those problems range a lot more it's

637
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,770
not just network right we actually have

638
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:45,770
quite a few I mean sales it requires a

639
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:48,379
lot of automation and it has some really

640
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:50,870
difficult problems to solve and having

641
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:53,480
the software you know people live and

642
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:55,129
eat with those teams allows them to gain

643
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,030
really deep malt knowledge about those

644
00:27:55,130 --> 00:28:01,160
problems and dive into that and again it

645
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,990
removes a lot of this whole central

646
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,400
processes whatever

647
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:10,669
it allows for a lot more freeform

648
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:13,520
engagement and I don't know I think it

649
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:17,090
works for it works for creating much

650
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,668
more inclusive and it sort of like

651
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:21,320
finding together teams yeah yeah yeah

652
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:23,450
you know if you think about inclusivity

653
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,159
and also the diversity in general when

654
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,809
you think about both of them when you do

655
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,610
try to squish them together what you're

656
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:30,559
really looking for is diversity of

657
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:32,719
thought and right whether it's a woman

658
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,020
or a man well you know what their race

659
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,080
is what their sexual orientation is the

660
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:39,690
benefit to your business

661
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,760
is the different the diverse background

662
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,050
because they're bringing a different way

663
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,090
of thinking about things and to your

664
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:46,950
point right that builds a better team

665
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,780
yeah it really does especially when you

666
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,940
have a big problem set in a diverse

667
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,379
problem set like you want a lot it you

668
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,610
don't want everyone that's gonna look at

669
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,500
solving the problems the same way

670
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:58,020
otherwise you know you could end up with

671
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,860
a lot of really bad solutions the title

672
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:03,930
is was interesting to me when I really

673
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,030
thought about that the new network

674
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:08,520
professional you know and even this

675
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:11,280
discussion we we always want to tend

676
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,470
towards well the technical aspects and

677
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:15,090
the technical qualities of people as

678
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:19,200
we're thinking about you know who should

679
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:21,810
be on our teams and and honestly I in a

680
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,810
lot of ways some of the best network

681
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:27,389
people I've ever worked with were one

682
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:32,159
was an entomologist one was you know a

683
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:35,850
bug guy if you know the the liberal arts

684
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:40,980
that that whole mindset we I don't have

685
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:42,780
we don't have a lot of you know the room

686
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:47,600
probably is a little low on that part of

687
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:50,460
the that that part as well but that that

688
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,919
diversity of thought an opinion

689
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:55,380
and and just a different background I

690
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:58,500
mean the the thing I was electrical

691
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:01,890
engineer in undergrad and grad school

692
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:05,450
and so very technical background the

693
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:10,380
thing I use more than anything today is

694
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:14,220
discounted cash flow even invented by

695
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:16,230
engineers but you know having a little

696
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:18,180
bit of business background was something

697
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:20,970
that I didn't personally have and and

698
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:23,670
and I think the new network professional

699
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,470
something like that is key no matter

700
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:27,390
what your job is whether it's a

701
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:29,690
technical job or writing code or

702
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:32,520
building hardware or running a business

703
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:35,130
you know that one thing is something you

704
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,320
know I see one of my Zao colleagues out

705
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:39,690
there Nikki and and she'd tell you you

706
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,179
know we probably talk about every

707
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,520
decision we make is around is around

708
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:48,000
driving the financial outcome for our

709
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:50,279
business and so having that as one of

710
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,950
the key qualities is something

711
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:55,649
like we think about everyday you know my

712
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:58,019
peer your ex esteemed colleague david

713
00:30:55,649 --> 00:31:00,869
ferleger who built a big chunk of the

714
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:02,159
level 3 CDN and built a netflix CDN do

715
00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:05,369
you know what his degree is in making

716
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,229
physics astronomy astronomy yeah yeah no

717
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:08,849
I admit I actually asked him an

718
00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:10,440
electrical engineering problem once and

719
00:31:08,849 --> 00:31:13,979
he's like how would I know the answer to

720
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,619
that like that's right Levi what are you

721
00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:18,239
seeing like what are you doing to give

722
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:20,699
people that breath like because

723
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:22,919
obviously it's very easy you're teaching

724
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,599
them Network e stuff yeah but what is

725
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:26,879
the expected background do you expect

726
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,200
them to also you know where do you

727
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:29,728
accept them expect them to dip their

728
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,989
toes into it yeah absolutely so we have

729
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:35,669
kind of two different answers to this so

730
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:37,710
where our program is now from where it

731
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:39,899
was five years ago you know five years

732
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:41,639
ago we were all core networking you know

733
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:43,918
a lot of what this conference was five

734
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:45,508
years ago and now you know we're getting

735
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,169
really close to the software development

736
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:52,440
side and and what I've noticed kind of

737
00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:55,200
immediately from you know being in where

738
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,330
our undergrads are usually EE or Telecom

739
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,999
and we're taking network engineers and

740
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:01,649
kind of teaching you more software now

741
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:03,869
that we're moving to the computer

742
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:06,209
science department we're taking software

743
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:08,549
engineers and teaching of networking and

744
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,389
it's a it's a completely different

745
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:11,149
concept

746
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:13,709
you know they definitely think about

747
00:32:11,149 --> 00:32:17,488
programming and solving problems much

748
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:19,469
differently and so in my classes like I

749
00:32:17,489 --> 00:32:21,479
said one of them is network automation

750
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:23,249
right so we start with here's network

751
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:25,289
engineering here's how you automate it

752
00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:26,849
and then kind of the next version of

753
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:29,190
that is the software-defined networking

754
00:32:26,849 --> 00:32:32,749
and regardless of what you think of that

755
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:35,609
topic the main outcome of that course is

756
00:32:32,749 --> 00:32:37,979
now that you know how networks function

757
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:41,129
think differently about it right if you

758
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:43,979
can start over you can program how the

759
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:45,359
network functions think about ARP we

760
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:47,369
don't have to broadcast it anymore

761
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:50,129
think about DHCP we can make that

762
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:52,619
unicast right so take what you know and

763
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:54,599
now that you know how networks function

764
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:56,849
how are we going to redesign that how

765
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:59,129
are we gonna think outside the box to do

766
00:32:56,849 --> 00:33:01,379
networks differently and kind of I think

767
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:03,800
what everyone is saying here a lot of

768
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:07,070
our best engineers can

769
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:09,470
make things work by thinking outside the

770
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:12,110
box and and that's a really hard trait

771
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:14,180
to teach right I coming from that's my

772
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,639
job right so that's a that's a hard

773
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,530
skill to teach but that's really what I

774
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,510
think these students are thriving with I

775
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,490
would agree with that so I wanted to

776
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,080
jump in and sort of extend that that

777
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:27,050
analogy and talk a little bit about

778
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,820
where every were maybe a quick poll in

779
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:34,639
their room how many people actually

780
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:36,290
write code every day every week so but a

781
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,420
benefit of the room they're about a

782
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:43,790
fifth room I I was hoping for a lot more

783
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,470
honestly the but it's not it's not that

784
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:47,600
it's just about the software to me

785
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,940
software is just a tool and a tool that

786
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,919
you need to learn we started this

787
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,540
software conversation four or five years

788
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:58,060
ago actually just at lunch we were

789
00:33:53,540 --> 00:34:01,340
talking somebody we Facebook created a a

790
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:03,440
hackathon called f bar a Facebook card

791
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,409
or a mediation about four and a half

792
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,640
years ago up in San Francisco about

793
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:09,200
helping people write code and how you

794
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,630
automate failures and things like that

795
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:14,540
so to me that conversation started years

796
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:15,710
ago four or five years ago and if you're

797
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,650
not writing software you get there

798
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:21,020
please do do get there because you want

799
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:25,580
to solve problems with with software but

800
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:28,400
the key here Tamiya is now problems what

801
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:31,730
problems are you solving and how you're

802
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:33,590
solving them to be software is just a

803
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:35,840
toolset that you need to learn and you

804
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:37,460
and it's not that you need to learn a

805
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,710
particular language or a particular

806
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,780
skill it's about the way you think

807
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,280
what's your mindset in solving those

808
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,380
problems how you approach them how you

809
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,669
break them down that's what's important

810
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:52,370
and you do that but so from it for me

811
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:55,310
the next professional is really about

812
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:56,960
problem solving take any problem there

813
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:59,600
in your pick it could be provisioning it

814
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,880
could be a new routing protocol to it be

815
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,950
device management to customer interface

816
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:07,190
things things like that it doesn't

817
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:09,589
matter can you take that problem and

818
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:11,900
break it down and design it in a way

819
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:14,840
that it's scalable and it's

820
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:16,190
operationally efficient if you want to

821
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,390
make it operationally efficient and

822
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,920
scalable you're gonna have to

823
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:22,069
sophomore software is just a base

824
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,170
underlying tool so the conversation

825
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:26,390
around software was years ago to me it's

826
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:28,930
really now can you focus on software

827
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:32,150
engineer solving problems that way I

828
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:35,058
remember like when I was sort of younger

829
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:37,339
and you would go interview people with

830
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:38,510
people a lot of times people will ask

831
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:39,799
these hey what do you want to be when

832
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:42,109
you grow up or what do you want to be in

833
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:43,880
five years and to me that's just such an

834
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:46,759
arcane question at this point it's like

835
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:49,910
it's not relevant what's relevant is

836
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,230
what experience are you gaining what do

837
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:54,319
you want to learn in the next two years

838
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:57,589
what do you want to solve in the next

839
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:59,089
two years trust me if you solve five

840
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:02,529
different problems in the next five

841
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:05,779
years you will grow period obviously

842
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:08,210
with the right mindset with operational

843
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:10,069
efficiency and scalability in mind to

844
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:12,260
solve real world problems if you solve

845
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:16,009
five big problems in five years you

846
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,569
would have grown period so to me that's

847
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,910
where we really need to take the network

848
00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:23,420
engineering conversation it's a great

849
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:26,118
piece of advice focusing your your

850
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:29,569
career on the things you want to

851
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:31,940
accomplish will almost always end up in

852
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:34,849
a better place and focusing on talent or

853
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:37,069
money and all those things poking

854
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:40,490
focusing on what you want to accomplish

855
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:43,339
either as an individual or a company is

856
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:46,578
really in my I give this career advice a

857
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:50,180
lots of people so focusing on that is is

858
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:51,369
just the best way to live your career so

859
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,269
I'm going to come back to that

860
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:54,079
specifically thematically if we have

861
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:56,959
time

862
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,059
Edward one thing that I wanted to talk a

863
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,000
little bit about here is what nanog is

864
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:03,740
up to as an organization you know my

865
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,230
personal opinion I've been fairly vocal

866
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:08,419
about it just a little bit is that it

867
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:12,769
needs to evolve and one thing that

868
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:14,720
struck me was looking at the keynotes

869
00:37:12,769 --> 00:37:17,299
for this conference you've got two

870
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,759
esteemed technologists who have been up

871
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:21,079
on this stage many times who are saying

872
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:22,910
talking about awesome things that are

873
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:26,119
highly relevant how do we get something

874
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:29,660
other than great years unfortunately now

875
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:30,819
like myself that is sad okay between

876
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:34,118
then I

877
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:35,469
yeah then I then I just look silly know

878
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:37,239
how to how do we get someone other than

879
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:39,880
the Greybeards up here how do we get

880
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:41,709
people to be relevant enough that we

881
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,009
want to hear from them in a keynote for

882
00:37:41,709 --> 00:37:46,448
a 1200 person conference well I think

883
00:37:44,009 --> 00:37:50,109
Nanog is an organization isn't an

884
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:51,279
interesting space we are filled with

885
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:53,979
people who work in a corporate

886
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:57,099
environment and the core focus of a

887
00:37:53,979 --> 00:37:58,509
corporation is to turn a profit in some

888
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:02,829
way or another

889
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:05,469
governments are designed to benefit

890
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:09,699
there they're there they're there people

891
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:11,769
there but they develop nonprofits as

892
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:13,660
something that exists in between we can

893
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:15,839
handle problems that are small enough

894
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,160
that government can't deal with

895
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,429
corporations have the folk on profits

896
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,229
nonprofits focused on doing good and I

897
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:24,579
believe that

898
00:38:22,229 --> 00:38:27,999
nanog being in an agnostic position

899
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:30,219
within the industry can help to recruit

900
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:32,348
the next generation of networked

901
00:38:30,219 --> 00:38:35,369
professionals I think that we can be at

902
00:38:32,349 --> 00:38:38,559
the forefront I would love to see a

903
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:40,539
panel of industry professionals who are

904
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:42,549
kind of helping us direct and guide us

905
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:44,769
as an organization to where we can reach

906
00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:47,769
out and help recruit the next generation

907
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:50,348
from Network engineers we have planned

908
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:52,299
this fall on the 17th 18th and 19th

909
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:54,459
we're going to be it to do we're gonna

910
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:57,369
be at University of Illinois we're going

911
00:38:54,459 --> 00:39:00,669
to be at Ball State and we're delivering

912
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:04,029
a mini Nanog experience tailored to that

913
00:39:00,669 --> 00:39:06,308
young audience and so my goal is that we

914
00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:07,719
can solve two problems an industry

915
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:10,569
problem where there are not enough

916
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:13,029
people to fill the positions out there I

917
00:39:10,569 --> 00:39:14,349
believe that we can help expand our

918
00:39:13,029 --> 00:39:17,259
memberships and the people that are

919
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:19,959
involved in Nanog and I think it happens

920
00:39:17,259 --> 00:39:21,459
by working out at the level of the young

921
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:23,499
and trying to encourage them to perceive

922
00:39:21,459 --> 00:39:26,259
and see that there are current ease

923
00:39:23,499 --> 00:39:29,919
within the industry and how can not be a

924
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:32,589
more inclusive environment I think that

925
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:34,328
well some of the things that I hope to

926
00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:37,719
have happen is develop a mentorship

927
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:39,069
program you can't really mentor unless

928
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:41,259
you have guidance on how to do it

929
00:39:39,069 --> 00:39:42,699
properly some people do it innately some

930
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:44,460
people just as a result of who they are

931
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:46,290
can reach out and create that

932
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,670
inclusive environment a lot of people

933
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,869
here have been going here for years and

934
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:50,490
they're friends and they want to hang

935
00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:52,560
out with their group of people but

936
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,819
there's it's an afterthought what about

937
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,160
the other people that have come along

938
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,380
and I think when to do those kind of

939
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,490
changes they must be done with

940
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:01,290
deliberation and that was reason I was

941
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,790
asking you what were you doing within

942
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:04,650
your organization because it doesn't

943
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,270
happen accidentally it happens because

944
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:08,280
people intend to make that happen

945
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:10,500
diversity will happen because is an

946
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,390
intention to create diversity inclusion

947
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:15,599
will happen because it's an intention to

948
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:17,759
make inclusion happen and in general on

949
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,190
the stage you know it's one thing we've

950
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,560
talked a bit so far about diversity

951
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:24,599
which is how do we get different faces

952
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,310
different opinions different backgrounds

953
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:28,320
in the door how do we keep them there

954
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:30,299
how do we grow them what are the big

955
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,210
efforts that like you know nauseum and

956
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:36,960
Jack and Anna what are you doing to to

957
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:39,690
keep to retain to grow to build I can

958
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,910
talk about this forever no no please try

959
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,800
to keep it we went from me thinking an

960
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:47,040
hour way too long now watching this talk

961
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:50,400
going it's actually a really really hard

962
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:52,580
problem on especially the girl side I'd

963
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,740
see that on our environment as well that

964
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:57,960
junior engineers join and you see women

965
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,910
in those ranks and then there's they

966
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,650
become senior and then women disappear

967
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,790
and we're like wait what happened

968
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:05,910
where'd they go

969
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:08,310
so it's it's definitely something that

970
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,839
we need to start looking at one you have

971
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:12,029
to start looking at data to see where's

972
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:15,930
actually where the trend is and where

973
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:20,160
people fall out there are very basic

974
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:21,690
fundamental traits or and biases that we

975
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,299
have I'll give you a very relevant

976
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:27,660
actual example a very simple example

977
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:29,970
where we do peer level reviews where

978
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:32,759
when you're doing your six monthly

979
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:36,359
review it's a peer review so a team of

980
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:38,010
three two men one woman when the woman

981
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:40,170
writes the feedback for the other two

982
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:41,700
men it's all glowing it's how awesome

983
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:45,000
they were how they collaborated how they

984
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:47,189
brought us in and all that when she

985
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,630
writes her own review it's the I did

986
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,190
this but this person helped and that

987
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:52,470
person helped them that person helped

988
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:54,420
and then when the men write they write a

989
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:56,149
sort of average balanced review and

990
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,960
saying hey this person did love a pop

991
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:03,069
you take those three

992
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,069
have any manager look at them the two

993
00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:07,750
men get promoted the woman doesn't

994
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:09,700
because just the way the biases are the

995
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:12,970
way we write things the way women

996
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:15,790
present themselves it's far more muted

997
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:19,720
you can throw a I added an A I will pick

998
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:21,609
the two managers two men to promote

999
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,529
because just the way the data is

1000
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:25,900
collected so there's a lot of inherent

1001
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:28,329
biases in our own systems and thoughts

1002
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,339
and processes that over time that have

1003
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:32,710
developed that we need to be cognizant

1004
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:35,349
of we need to especially senior people

1005
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:37,240
managers tech needs that are actually

1006
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:38,890
driving meetings that they need to drive

1007
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,720
those conversations and do a lot better

1008
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:43,118
so I can talk about it forever but I'll

1009
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,368
let others jump in but there's just one

1010
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:47,710
example of that we've seen relevant

1011
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:50,589
example absolute space I think you have

1012
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:54,130
to be intentional and it's it's it takes

1013
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:55,869
more than just the leadership and but it

1014
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:58,059
that's an important thing I mean the

1015
00:42:55,869 --> 00:43:02,020
leadership has to that's where it starts

1016
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:04,210
start and and drive that that intent but

1017
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:06,970
then it's a up to kind of everybody and

1018
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:09,790
it's everybody participating it's

1019
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:11,529
talking about it it's we do quarterly

1020
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:15,009
reviews believe it believe it or not

1021
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:17,349
once a quarter every employee gets a

1022
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:19,420
review once a quarter it's unbelievable

1023
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:20,290
at first I thought oh my god this is

1024
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,510
gonna be a nightmare

1025
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:26,558
it actually is the greatest thing I've

1026
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:30,190
ever been a part of it it has the most

1027
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:32,260
incredible immediate feedback is

1028
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:35,500
something you learn both positive and

1029
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:37,950
negative but but that drives such a

1030
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:40,900
great kind of work ethic and an

1031
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:45,160
intention around around diversity around

1032
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:48,309
inclusion it really is and we're as

1033
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:51,308
tough an organization as anybody but but

1034
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:53,319
that quarterly feedback is such a great

1035
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:56,349
thing and I think the reason why our

1036
00:43:53,319 --> 00:43:58,119
numbers for inclusion and diversity and

1037
00:43:56,349 --> 00:43:59,859
everything are a little bit better than

1038
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:03,329
the rest of our industry right now is

1039
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:06,098
because of that because of that intent

1040
00:44:03,329 --> 00:44:07,839
so I'm gonna have to bear with me for a

1041
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:09,309
second here because I this is the first

1042
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,750
like there's a couple things I want to

1043
00:44:09,309 --> 00:44:12,010
put together and this is the first time

1044
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:15,100
I've ever tried to for

1045
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:17,980
why's it completely so first off very

1046
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:21,790
specifically - you know what we do to

1047
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:23,890
keep people engaged at that packet

1048
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:25,390
fabric is you know I talked about before

1049
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:28,210
we have sort of this homogeneous group

1050
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:30,190
of sres NRI software engineers network

1051
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,480
engineers that everyone can sort of

1052
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:32,800
shift around right because I think one

1053
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,990
of the key things especially for

1054
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,660
engineering minds to keep engaged is

1055
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:39,490
learning new things so if you build that

1056
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,629
inherently into job positions right

1057
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:42,430
we've always had these really weird

1058
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,170
rigid lines you know a software

1059
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,220
engineering network engineering like oh

1060
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:47,080
sorry

1061
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:48,459
when in reality all the skills are

1062
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,859
pretty much the same and why I'm so

1063
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:52,480
happy to hear about Levi's like the

1064
00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:53,580
courses that are happening right now at

1065
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,650
cu-boulder

1066
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:58,330
so I think keeping those really fluid

1067
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:00,160
lines and letting people work on

1068
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:02,799
different projects definitely helps to

1069
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,600
keep people engaged and then one of the

1070
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,190
other things like we so there's this

1071
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,569
Google project I'm going to get the name

1072
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:09,190
wrong because I've been trying to think

1073
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:11,109
of it it's like project Archimedes but

1074
00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:14,650
it's all about how teams work the best

1075
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:16,119
together and it basically it's on rework

1076
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,530
you guys should all read it it's

1077
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:20,109
actually required reading for all of our

1078
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:21,400
new hires and it's it's all about how

1079
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:23,350
the teams that have the best

1080
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,990
collaboration are the most effective

1081
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:28,359
right and so as we move farther up the

1082
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,830
stack with Network right you know okay

1083
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:31,390
so we've got automated upgrades now

1084
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:32,890
right schedule upgrade between the

1085
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:34,299
morning no one's got to be around you

1086
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:36,279
know if it fails it's does it thing you

1087
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:38,140
know if a lion card fails okay great the

1088
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:39,400
system goes out ships a new one contacts

1089
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,480
the warehouse to get it installed

1090
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,180
swapped out okay great

1091
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,880
right we're automating away the the

1092
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:47,730
bottom you know the low-hanging fruit so

1093
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,930
the next level up is the actual

1094
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:51,160
correlation of Network events you know

1095
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:53,529
what happens when we have a lot of

1096
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,819
failures why did that happen like if we

1097
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,440
could have the system figure that out

1098
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,480
that would be great and we're not going

1099
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,820
to get to that point unless we have

1100
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,340
super high collaboration across all

1101
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:04,930
those sort of resources and one of the

1102
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,420
things that I've noticed in the past is

1103
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,770
that network has been especially

1104
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,450
segregated you know it's always like oh

1105
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:11,950
the network the network's over there you

1106
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:14,799
know it's over there and it kind of gave

1107
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:16,810
rise to this culture of the brilliant

1108
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,150
jerk a little bit you know the guys who

1109
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:21,869
are suit on I shouldn't say guys that's

1110
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:24,330
a I'm sorry the people the people who

1111
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:27,300
are you

1112
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:29,299
super knowledgeable but also just don't

1113
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,920
work well in team environments right and

1114
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:35,310
with the classic technical introvert

1115
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,840
right it is and I you know I was trying

1116
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:38,070
to think here up here actual listen

1117
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,960
everybody talk it's a little bit

1118
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:41,610
chicken-and-egg right it's like how did

1119
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,440
that happen right was it the fact that

1120
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:44,400
we segregated the network off that gave

1121
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,320
rise to that where were those people

1122
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,320
drawn to it and it's a very weird thing

1123
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,180
but one thing I'm pretty sure of though

1124
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,430
is that in order to reach this next

1125
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:55,140
level of automation and self-driving

1126
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:57,839
networks never word that we want to get

1127
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:00,319
those barriers have to be severely

1128
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:03,720
broken down and that mindset of

1129
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:11,490
segregation and it needs to go away you

1130
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:13,230
know I think there's been a flip I look

1131
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:16,709
back to when I was first looking for a

1132
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:18,330
job and and the thing you were asked

1133
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:21,930
when you were in a job interview was are

1134
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:24,840
you a self-starter and can you work

1135
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:29,279
independently that was a key thing in

1136
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:32,520
the eighties so so you had this this

1137
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,120
bias in the workforce of wanting you

1138
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:37,680
almost encouraged people to be

1139
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:40,950
introverted to work on their own and

1140
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:43,230
that's flipped yeah it's it's completely

1141
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:45,689
opposite we care more than anything

1142
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:47,670
about can you work in a team can you

1143
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:50,130
thrive in a team can you work well with

1144
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:53,550
others although all the obvious things

1145
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:55,470
but but that was not the case 20 years

1146
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:57,090
ago 25 years ago but you also need to

1147
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:59,370
make space right at the end of the day

1148
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:00,990
yeah people like you know people don't

1149
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:02,730
always realize about me I'm like a super

1150
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,109
introvert I'm fine like I don't care

1151
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:06,270
being up in front of this group this

1152
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:07,830
doesn't bother me at all but you put me

1153
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:09,840
one-on-one with someone who I don't know

1154
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:13,529
at dinner and it's like mortifying and

1155
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:15,570
so I but we're we're learning to embrace

1156
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:17,190
those those qualities and people and

1157
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:19,050
figure out how to use them right how

1158
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:21,000
they can be beneficial to the business

1159
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,470
because you can't change that as much as

1160
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,050
you want to say you can change that you

1161
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:27,029
can and that kind of leads in to the

1162
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:28,530
next question that we're gonna try to to

1163
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:30,020
move us pretty quickly through so that

1164
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:32,850
we can just take some audience questions

1165
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:36,030
there's been attention for a long time

1166
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:37,529
between people who come in are excellent

1167
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:39,390
technologists for

1168
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:41,730
and then go well what's my career path

1169
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:43,410
and some people go well you know I

1170
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:45,270
should go into management and they do

1171
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:46,828
that because they want the title or they

1172
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:49,440
want the money which was your point much

1173
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:52,020
earlier and not necessarily because they

1174
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,970
love the idea of managing people or they

1175
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,500
want to run things right they just want

1176
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:57,629
to be the one who gets to make decisions

1177
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,339
about the technology and people come

1178
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,510
along with that so when you have those

1179
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:02,160
types of discussions with people or

1180
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:04,290
someone comes to you and says I want to

1181
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,940
be a leader how do you handle that do

1182
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:07,619
you go you know do you put that through

1183
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,930
a screen through a filter and go well

1184
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:11,940
maybe not but here's ways you could be

1185
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:13,799
more advanced technologically and grow

1186
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,319
your career here or do you try to

1187
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:18,180
cultivate them as a leader I work or

1188
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:21,329
option C I mean I didn't do that one

1189
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:24,140
there are two ways to thing one you

1190
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:26,730
specifically ask what's your motivation

1191
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:28,770
but I want to cover the other aspect as

1192
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:30,630
well to actually create a culture and

1193
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:32,599
environment that people don't feel like

1194
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:36,839
they need to be in management to have

1195
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:38,520
influence and have a say right so would

1196
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:40,589
like we have done we have we have three

1197
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,780
tracks you have an individual

1198
00:49:40,589 --> 00:49:45,990
contributor track engineers that make

1199
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:47,730
decisions you have what we call tech

1200
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,229
leads let me cover the managers first

1201
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:51,510
manager is easy you're building your

1202
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:52,920
auric you're building or it's or various

1203
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:54,869
sizes solving different problems

1204
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,690
we created a third one called tech lead

1205
00:49:54,869 --> 00:49:59,010
managers where you're a deeply technical

1206
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:01,050
person you want to solve large-scale

1207
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:03,060
problems often large-scale problems

1208
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:04,349
require a team of three four or five six

1209
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,810
ten people

1210
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:09,180
what's your growth how are you going to

1211
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:11,190
become a director level if you are only

1212
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:13,980
going to manage six people what does

1213
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:15,079
that look like so what we've done is

1214
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:19,950
we've created the tech lead manager

1215
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:22,410
track which allows people to be and I

1216
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:23,879
see or a manager depending on what

1217
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:26,910
problem they're solving and manage a

1218
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:29,130
small team and grow in that and we have

1219
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:30,810
director even VP level technique

1220
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,790
managers we have director and VP level

1221
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:34,410
I see people so one you have to want to

1222
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:36,509
create that system that people don't

1223
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:38,069
feel that they have to be in one track

1224
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:39,839
or another because each track has a

1225
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:42,000
sweet ceiling or whatever glass ceiling

1226
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:43,890
that they feel like they have so we we

1227
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,900
do have those three tracks and they you

1228
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:48,960
can find VP level people in all three

1229
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:50,309
then the then the question becomes to

1230
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,199
you build a culture

1231
00:50:50,309 --> 00:50:57,079
which actually allows people to make

1232
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:59,789
decisions and you can ask people or

1233
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:01,529
majority of the managers that you will

1234
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:03,779
find a Facebook they'll say I support

1235
00:51:01,529 --> 00:51:07,229
such-and-such team they'll never say I

1236
00:51:03,779 --> 00:51:08,880
lead this team because the leadership

1237
00:51:07,229 --> 00:51:10,948
comes from the technical technology

1238
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,829
folks that are actually driving these

1239
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:16,140
decisions you're supporting and removing

1240
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:19,380
roadblocks you're guiding at some places

1241
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:21,689
so building that culture actually makes

1242
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:23,910
that happen then you start seeing the

1243
00:51:21,689 --> 00:51:25,739
obvious like yeah I never want to be a

1244
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:27,660
manager because it sucks to be a manager

1245
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:29,699
I want to stay a tech lead and there are

1246
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:31,319
a couple of text leaves here that I see

1247
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:33,329
from from our space as well that

1248
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:36,808
actually have gone through that path so

1249
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:39,390
you have to actually show and do before

1250
00:51:36,809 --> 00:51:40,499
you can change minds the trouble we do

1251
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:43,140
have is when people come from the

1252
00:51:40,499 --> 00:51:44,759
outside they're like no no no no I want

1253
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,769
to be a director because I want to have

1254
00:51:44,759 --> 00:51:48,900
influence and then you have to take walk

1255
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:50,788
them off that ledge to say you're really

1256
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:53,640
not going to get to make decisions if

1257
00:51:50,789 --> 00:51:56,729
you wanna come in at that Jack I've been

1258
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:58,499
a champion of this structure since you

1259
00:51:56,729 --> 00:52:01,890
know the beginning a little three I mean

1260
00:51:58,499 --> 00:52:04,169
I absolutely believe you have to create

1261
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:07,739
structure that supports you know the

1262
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:11,279
ability to to have huge influence and

1263
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:12,989
not not be a leader and you know go back

1264
00:52:11,279 --> 00:52:14,640
to those days you know half the people

1265
00:52:12,989 --> 00:52:18,449
work and your group or work in your

1266
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:22,709
group now but but those were we had I

1267
00:52:18,449 --> 00:52:24,749
think 14 architects back then and those

1268
00:52:22,709 --> 00:52:28,109
14 people decided everything for the

1269
00:52:24,749 --> 00:52:29,729
company everything and you just have to

1270
00:52:28,109 --> 00:52:31,650
build that kind of structure it doesn't

1271
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:33,569
matter how many people you have in your

1272
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:36,259
group or whatever but there are key

1273
00:52:33,569 --> 00:52:39,239
positions that that make key decisions

1274
00:52:36,259 --> 00:52:40,650
for your company whatever you're doing

1275
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,019
and it doesn't matter about the

1276
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:44,910
management structure on all those how do

1277
00:52:43,019 --> 00:52:46,919
you guys develop the soft skills that

1278
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:49,109
you need to manage people because what

1279
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,329
it takes to be great technology is also

1280
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:53,640
often the antithesis of what it takes to

1281
00:52:51,329 --> 00:52:56,400
manage people it's like an in sports the

1282
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:57,299
guy who is the you know an all-american

1283
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,239
the best player ever

1284
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:01,060
they make horrible coach well what what

1285
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:03,700
did

1286
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:06,100
Olivia say when asked though you know

1287
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:09,910
had he become such a great actor he said

1288
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:11,920
a thousand plays I'd say repetition

1289
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:14,379
feedback some people are natural leaders

1290
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,540
but the only way to be come like that in

1291
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:19,350
my opinion become a great leaders to is

1292
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:22,090
to do it get lots and lots of feedback

1293
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:24,310
you will hear lots of things that you

1294
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:26,500
don't like probably it hurts to hear the

1295
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:28,690
things that you're not good at but if

1296
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:31,360
you can if you can make it through that

1297
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:32,860
and your job as a leader of managers is

1298
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,530
to provide that feedback

1299
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:37,480
I really think that that many many

1300
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:38,950
people even though it's not me naturally

1301
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,980
let me go to Anna with this I want to go

1302
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:44,859
out to the audience that's okay now so

1303
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:47,410
Edward tours to follow up on that

1304
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:49,690
question real quick we use a lot of

1305
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:52,270
direct feedback so we actually we follow

1306
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:54,400
Netflix in the 360 style reviews because

1307
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:57,490
I think that they're very brilliant so a

1308
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:00,280
lot of feedback and then also as far as

1309
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:01,359
like people who want to grow into you

1310
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,250
know leadership roles and don't have

1311
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,820
those skills repetition I mean Jack you

1312
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:04,990
were right on

1313
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:08,020
it's like repetition repetition

1314
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:10,089
repetition if somebody wants to get into

1315
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:13,060
a new position and they are not very

1316
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:15,850
good at say you know confronting a

1317
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:18,070
colleague on you know an issue of like

1318
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:19,240
quality of work you know like the code

1319
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:20,860
they're producing isn't up to it

1320
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:24,189
guess what I will make that person do

1321
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:25,870
that all the time continually until they

1322
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:27,910
master being able to confront someone

1323
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:29,920
saying hey this is what is wrong with

1324
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:32,290
your code you know I gave you you know I

1325
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,210
commented on your PR I gave you a whole

1326
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:37,390
write-up on it and I'll make them do

1327
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:39,460
that until they're comfortable with it I

1328
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:41,350
want 20 seconds on this okay sorry they

1329
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:43,090
feel passionate about this where to me

1330
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:45,730
it starts with the intent it was

1331
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:47,530
resupplied in your question yes if you

1332
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:49,330
come in as a manner into a management

1333
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:51,430
position with the wrong intended oh I'm

1334
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:54,370
gonna make technical decisions you will

1335
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:56,140
never learn you will fail most of the

1336
00:54:54,370 --> 00:54:58,750
time so it doesn't matter how much you

1337
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:01,870
teach them intent is what's important

1338
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:04,540
because a manager's job is so much EQ so

1339
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:07,330
much supporting fine helping you roar

1340
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:10,150
bellowing defining EQ defining oh define

1341
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:12,460
EQ essentially being able to read people

1342
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:14,110
because the thing is it's easy to talk

1343
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,470
to machines because they usually tend to

1344
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:16,900
be

1345
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:19,509
the way they describe to behave human

1346
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:21,310
beings don't you can tell the same thing

1347
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:23,050
to ten human beings and get ten

1348
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:25,240
different reactions how do you read that

1349
00:55:23,050 --> 00:55:28,660
how do you accommodate that how do you

1350
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:30,790
inspire the ten right that's those are

1351
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:33,250
the EQ things so if you come in for the

1352
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:35,589
wrong reason I'm sorry you can't learn

1353
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:37,599
it's gonna be hard I'm gonna throw it

1354
00:55:35,589 --> 00:55:39,549
out to the audience hey I'm up with it

1355
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:41,230
you can you can add if you have a

1356
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:43,119
question for the panel please come up to

1357
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:44,170
a microphone and Anna will finish her

1358
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,569
answer and then we'll go to the audience

1359
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:48,550
I just wanted to say that part of our

1360
00:55:46,569 --> 00:55:50,650
eco statement is I think a really

1361
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:52,450
important one is not too big for the

1362
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:54,250
small things not too small for the big

1363
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:56,200
things and what that essentially means

1364
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:58,780
is you are never in a position that is

1365
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:01,750
too great to pick up paper off the floor

1366
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:03,130
and you are never in a position so small

1367
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:06,310
that you can't make an important

1368
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:07,780
decision yourself absolutely right in

1369
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:11,380
the middle here hey there this thing

1370
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:13,000
okay I'm Spencer Martin so there I think

1371
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:15,190
came up a few times or at least it was

1372
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,869
talked around with questions or comments

1373
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:19,569
like entomologist was the best network

1374
00:56:16,869 --> 00:56:21,849
engineer I ever knew or the pipeline

1375
00:56:19,569 --> 00:56:24,190
reduces as you go forward is there a

1376
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:25,930
current assumption that the next network

1377
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:28,260
professional has a higher level degree

1378
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:31,960
and should that be the assumption I

1379
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:34,270
don't have a degree so and I try to go

1380
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,250
out of my way to make sure that no one

1381
00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:39,480
in my organization cares whether or not

1382
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:39,480
someone has a degree sorry Levi

1383
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:46,400
but I agree I mean I think there's there

1384
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:48,740
there probably is there's room for

1385
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,770
anybody that's talented whether it comes

1386
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:54,649
with a degree or not you know is that

1387
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:59,240
can you cast a wide enough net net at

1388
00:56:54,650 --> 00:57:04,460
times probably not so I think being able

1389
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:06,890
to you know I I know people probably in

1390
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:10,430
the room that's got Brandner Scott

1391
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:12,319
doesn't have a degree probably one of

1392
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:15,470
the most impactful people in the

1393
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:17,480
internet so you know I I don't think

1394
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:20,000
that's a necessarily a qualification

1395
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,630
it's not a bad thing to have now don't

1396
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,240
get me wrong

1397
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:25,280
yeah so to me it's about learning how to

1398
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:27,049
learn yeah and that's what College

1399
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,430
teaches you they're not necessarily

1400
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:30,470
teaching me a skill it's teaching you

1401
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:32,149
how to learn everybody learns

1402
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:35,060
differently go figure out how you learn

1403
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:36,590
if it's a degree go get that if not go

1404
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:41,990
do something else absolutely perfectly

1405
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:44,030
fine no central area hi guys I'm sorry

1406
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:46,459
Sanjay Gupta I am currently a graduate

1407
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:51,140
student in Texas A&M University in my

1408
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:54,430
final semester so I like to ask so when

1409
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:56,779
I came in Texas A&M and started working

1410
00:57:54,430 --> 00:58:00,140
wanted to be a network professionals

1411
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:03,200
when I graduate so one question keeps

1412
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:05,900
nagging at me was how do you define the

1413
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:08,629
next network professional because

1414
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:10,580
nowadays the lines are getting blurry

1415
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:11,990
you have engineers who are writing

1416
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,819
software course they are software

1417
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:17,060
engineers they're system engineers

1418
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:20,360
coming in and so basically my question

1419
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:22,430
to you is how do you define the next

1420
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:25,760
network professional what you're looking

1421
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:28,399
for in skillsets tools this next next Oh

1422
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,350
professionals would have thank you so

1423
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,270
but the answer there is definitely

1424
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:34,490
broader skill set right not just

1425
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:37,850
necessarily network engineering knowing

1426
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:38,990
your protocols but also you know not

1427
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:41,420
necessarily that you have to be a

1428
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:43,459
full-blown software engineer or you know

1429
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:45,680
a system admin genius but you know you

1430
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:47,300
should be familiar with what get is you

1431
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:49,430
know what the open source tools are

1432
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:51,350
around using stuff and having more

1433
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:52,940
breadth even outside of network

1434
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:54,828
engineering right I mean maybe

1435
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:57,440
something about psychology you know see

1436
00:58:54,829 --> 00:58:59,869
what that brings to the table just yeah

1437
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,839
in general have have a Swiss Army knife

1438
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:04,790
of skills to choose from and not all

1439
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:06,740
them necessarily need to be deep or as

1440
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:08,869
deep as your network engineering but

1441
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:09,890
having more diversity in your skill set

1442
00:59:08,869 --> 00:59:14,960
will bring a lot to the table

1443
00:59:09,890 --> 00:59:18,890
I'd like to jobs eda Oh calm all right

1444
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:21,380
all right know what we you and them the

1445
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:23,509
Mike behind so the in the front sorry

1446
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:25,369
sorry nice light Steve Powell from

1447
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:28,640
CenturyLink I'm interested in your

1448
00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:31,130
opinion of whether telecommuting versus

1449
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:33,410
not telecommuting is do you figure is

1450
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:34,930
which one is more the vant aegis or does

1451
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:39,710
it not matter

1452
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:42,799
doing who on this stage has a greater

1453
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:48,349
than 30 percent of your staff is not at

1454
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:53,329
HQ not age cubed well I mean it not at a

1455
00:59:48,349 --> 00:59:57,230
at a headquarters I feel super

1456
00:59:53,329 --> 01:00:00,950
passionate about this and it it it

1457
00:59:57,230 --> 01:00:04,430
depends in the stage of company so so

1458
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:06,140
Zao we bought 48 companies and what

1459
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:08,990
happened when we bought 48 companies we

1460
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:11,720
had people all over the planet and it

1461
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:13,939
was hard to run the company it was and

1462
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:16,700
that there's you know I know it's not

1463
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:19,339
the most popular thing but we attempted

1464
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:21,589
to move people to our kind of core work

1465
01:00:19,339 --> 01:00:22,940
areas and our productivity has improved

1466
01:00:21,589 --> 01:00:25,730
because of it

1467
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:28,190
not super popular but but the notion of

1468
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:31,940
telecommuting is more a bit to me about

1469
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:34,579
flexibility I I want everyone to have

1470
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:36,619
flexibility i but I do believe that

1471
01:00:34,579 --> 01:00:38,990
teams can work better when they see each

1472
01:00:36,619 --> 01:00:41,750
other so it's been a tough balance for

1473
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:44,419
us right now we were so distributed it

1474
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:47,530
was not productive right and we had to

1475
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:49,700
become more more centralized if you will

1476
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:52,700
but you know what you know what's

1477
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:54,290
happened our employees we survey every

1478
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:56,000
quarter we do everything every quarter

1479
01:00:54,290 --> 01:01:00,710
or employee set has gone through the

1480
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:03,260
roof our attrition has gone down even

1481
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:05,450
though it's painful to get there the

1482
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,330
numbers speak for themselves I'm gonna

1483
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:08,879
let Anna and

1484
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:10,620
with the opposite opinion here and then

1485
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,140
we'll go to the last question yes

1486
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:15,089
absolutely I even think the term

1487
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:16,890
telecommuting sorry it's really outdated

1488
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:20,190
it's remote it's it's remote work or

1489
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:21,420
it's just how you work right and you

1490
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:23,240
really have to be set up as an

1491
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:25,800
organization to make people successful

1492
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,850
being remote that's all there is to it

1493
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,920
and like the reason for high attrition

1494
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:31,470
rates is because you're just not getting

1495
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:33,930
those people included right and I've

1496
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:36,299
seen this a lot and companies across the

1497
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:37,770
board here but as long as you have the

1498
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:41,520
tools in place to make people feel

1499
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:43,850
included I think you can have even a

1500
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:46,320
possibly stronger group of people

1501
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:49,140
remotely than you can in an office

1502
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:50,820
because you have inherently you have to

1503
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,900
get really good at communication right

1504
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:53,580
and you have to get really good at

1505
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,900
communication with a bunch of people

1506
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:57,000
because there's no stopping in the

1507
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:58,620
hallway to have a one-off conversation

1508
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,150
to get something done like you have to

1509
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:02,339
become very effective at communicating

1510
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:04,320
your ideas and I think it makes every

1511
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:07,230
single person on this and on the on a

1512
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:09,120
remote team much stronger thank you last

1513
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:12,150
question I believe it's Michael Michael

1514
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:14,069
Costello with Netflix both Edward and

1515
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:16,560
Nasim said in the introduction that they

1516
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:17,910
learned a lot from failures I think

1517
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,170
there was a lot more latitude for that

1518
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:21,480
in the 80s and 90s

1519
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:25,440
so what tolerance do we have for failure

1520
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:29,490
and learning from it today I think one

1521
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:32,850
of our most famous culture posters saves

1522
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:34,620
move fast break things the one that I'm

1523
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:36,720
still trying to parse nine years later

1524
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:39,060
to figure out how da how that works or

1525
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:42,540
implement how how to implement it it's

1526
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:45,930
called Phil harder so failures are sort

1527
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:48,000
of inherent in our in our culture but I

1528
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:49,350
want to be clear it's not about failure

1529
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,780
like you know that was the first

1530
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:53,819
question I asked when I joined the team

1531
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:55,410
was like okay so move has great things

1532
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:59,160
so can we just break the network is that

1533
01:02:55,410 --> 01:03:00,960
okay obviously that's not okay you can't

1534
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,940
live without the network anymore so the

1535
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:05,690
the conversation is about risk and risk

1536
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:08,600
assessment and how do you assess risk

1537
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:11,100
that you're taking and can we teach

1538
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:13,500
every engineer how to take the

1539
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:15,870
appropriate risk and if you take the

1540
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,880
risk and it still fails so be it

1541
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:19,660
deal with it what actually ends up

1542
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,750
happening is and you start building

1543
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:25,509
that have better sustainability better

1544
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:28,329
resiliency to it so the when the failure

1545
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:30,250
does happen you have to make sure that

1546
01:03:28,329 --> 01:03:32,619
your follow ups the post-mortems or

1547
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:34,329
every column some reviews are focused on

1548
01:03:32,619 --> 01:03:36,130
solving the problem and making it more

1549
01:03:34,329 --> 01:03:39,220
resilient for next time and that it's

1550
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:41,230
not a bitch hunt that is the key problem

1551
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:43,270
that I see in a lot of organization that

1552
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:45,549
post-mortems have become about who

1553
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:48,730
caused the problem who made the the

1554
01:03:45,549 --> 01:03:50,829
fat-finger mistake one of my mentors

1555
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:53,140
used to say yeah sure

1556
01:03:50,829 --> 01:03:55,329
you somebody made a config change and

1557
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:56,828
made a fat finger this is going to

1558
01:03:55,329 --> 01:04:00,160
happen again how are you gonna protect

1559
01:03:56,829 --> 01:04:01,809
yourself another option is if you come

1560
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:06,129
get a master's degree you can break

1561
01:04:01,809 --> 01:04:07,850
things every day and with that thank you

1562
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:17,989
to the panel

1563
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:17,989
[Applause]

1564
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:27,700
you
