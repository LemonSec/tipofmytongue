three gentlemen I have the first

13
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,620
question I have today is a two-part

14
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:09,020
question and I'm going to start with

15
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:11,030
Brad okay how did you join in network

16
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,789
operations industry and start attending

17
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:16,039
Nanog do you think it's easier or more

18
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:20,200
difficult for new entrants into our

19
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:22,999
industry so I attended my first nanog

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:27,530
while I was in Denver I think was in the

21
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:29,359
50s I wanted to attend so I started in

22
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,920
the industry in the network operation

23
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,289
center at limelight networks

24
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,999
I was level and knocked technician I had

25
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:37,460
zero experience in the industry I

26
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:41,990
actually used to repo cars before I cut

27
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:44,538
into this industry so I had a boss that

28
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,249
took a chance on me and I got in like

29
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:49,100
most people when they get into a NOC

30
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:50,589
they want to do as much as I can build

31
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,359
their career up and get out of the NOC

32
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,780
so I pushed as hard as I could and

33
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:59,780
finally made it out of the NOC itself

34
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:02,509
and focused on interconnection I had a

35
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,950
boss who was kind enough to invite me to

36
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:07,639
my first nanog once that happened I

37
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,619
instantly fell in love with the

38
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:12,880
community and wanted to do as much as I

39
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:12,880
could and attend as many as I could

40
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:19,430
thanks

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,380
Patrick I don't know why I don't

42
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:26,390
microphone but they put one on my shirt

43
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:30,470
so my first nanog was a long time ago it

44
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:32,179
was actually in the 90s and I was in the

45
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:36,530
networking field for enterprises before

46
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,330
that I got a job in an isp a national

47
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,540
service writer went to my first nanog

48
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,430
and much like brad i fell in love with

49
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:47,150
the community i think it was a great way

50
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:49,700
to get to know people so I've always

51
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:53,630
said that networking is not just about

52
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,549
you know a router bgp foo it's actually

53
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,170
making people talk to each other and

54
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,140
then they make the routers talk to each

55
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,940
other and I've said this many times

56
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,799
publicly and privately that I honestly

57
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,660
believe there is something strange

58
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,740
inside of a human beings head when they

59
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,109
look another person in the eye

60
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,550
physically close to each other it's

61
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,250
different than over video conference or

62
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:15,950
over email or over phone or something

63
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,420
like that just something changes that

64
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,769
when I come to an an OGG and I see

65
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,970
somebody in person I shake their hand

66
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:21,950
and I talked to them for even five

67
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,780
minutes then six months later and I need

68
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,640
to call them up for some reason things

69
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,620
go better they go smoother and that's a

70
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,029
big reason why I think now now gets so

71
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,370
important still to this day to this

72
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,620
community it was easy for me to get in

73
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,900
but I got really lucky I got a I got a

74
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,370
sweet job that let me go and things like

75
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,400
that and a lot of people even back in

76
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,710
the 90s didn't have such luck today I

77
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,180
actually think it's harder to get into

78
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,710
nanog it's easier to get into the

79
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,150
industry because there's lots of you

80
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,400
know open jobs especially at the lower

81
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,990
levels but it's harder to get into nanog

82
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,940
and this is one of the things that I've

83
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,740
been working on and I think Edward is

84
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,690
actually doing a good job changing

85
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,120
inside of nanog but I think it's harder

86
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,010
as a low-level employee to get the

87
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,810
budget or whatever it takes to come to a

88
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,450
place like Nanna but I think it's vital

89
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:10,400
for us to try and make that easier for

90
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:13,820
people thank you our second question I'm

91
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,010
again start with you Brad what do you

92
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,079
think about the newcomers launch and do

93
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:21,738
you feel that it succeeds in welcoming

94
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,260
new participants so I think the

95
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:27,919
newcomers lunch is great I've been

96
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:32,180
volunteering at it for several years now

97
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:36,169
as a veteran to help introduce newcomers

98
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,999
to the conference I like the format I

99
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:41,719
think we could probably do a little bit

100
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:44,659
more to make it more inviting for

101
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:47,900
newcomers to attend the lunch currently

102
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:49,009
it's we have a sign you show up you have

103
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,150
lunch you sit down at the table with

104
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:51,620
somebody who's been around for a while

105
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,688
to give you a little information about

106
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,800
now not to answer any questions I feel

107
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:57,020
like we should be promoting it a little

108
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,150
bit more than we actually are

109
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,409
most the people are at that time we're

110
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,870
just rying to find a spot to eat lunch

111
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:03,919
in all honesty so it's either you full

112
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,419
you fall into the room with the

113
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,520
newcomers lunch or you go to the general

114
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:09,560
lunch but I think we should be doing

115
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,990
more to promote the newcomers launch and

116
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,969
to start making even more welcoming than

117
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,490
we already have

118
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:19,310
thank you for your response Patrick this

119
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,529
next question is for you what if

120
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:25,099
anything should Nanog do to ensure that

121
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:31,360
Nanog is diverse and inclusive going

122
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:34,580
forward that's a tall order so there's a

123
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,219
lot of things that we could do some

124
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:40,039
things that we should do and we are

125
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:42,589
actually trying to do many of them first

126
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:46,250
of all I think the code of conduct is a

127
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:49,099
good example there's lots of people that

128
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:51,020
don't know certain things are bad

129
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,159
there's lots of people that have acted

130
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,399
bad in the past and there's things that

131
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:57,800
we need to change going forward but

132
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,969
mostly I would I want and I'm not I'll

133
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,949
be real honest I'm not a hundred percent

134
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:02,449
sure how to reach this point but we'll

135
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:04,969
see what I want is when somebody walks

136
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:06,919
in doesn't matter where they're from or

137
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:08,300
what gender they are or anything else

138
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:11,779
they feel a hundred percent comfortable

139
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,000
being in here and talking to anyone else

140
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:15,589
in the room the only thing that should

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,750
matter is you know do you have good

142
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:20,300
ideas and archaeological and a lot of

143
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:23,810
people say that but the problem is that

144
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:26,870
whether or not that's the goal whether

145
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:30,229
or not that's what nanog stands for you

146
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:32,750
can still come in here and feel fill

147
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:34,938
held back based on things that have

148
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,099
happened five 10 20 years ago things

149
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:39,709
that happened outside of nanog and so

150
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:41,479
trying to figure out a way for nanak to

151
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:45,229
encourage people to get past that

152
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:48,378
is a really good idea the problem is I'm

153
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:50,089
middle-aged white dude so I don't

154
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,589
understand you know I've got ideas but I

155
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:54,319
don't understand exactly what it takes

156
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:55,729
this is why we reach out to people to do

157
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,279
things like the women in tech lunch why

158
00:06:55,729 --> 00:07:00,020
we encourage people to you know run for

159
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,509
the board I ask Susan to run for the

160
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,900
board and she got on and now we have you

161
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:07,370
know more female voices on the board

162
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,599
things like that and these are the kind

163
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,270
of things that we need to do to make

164
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:14,089
sure that that we can get that

165
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:17,448
inclusiveness because I'm not gonna get

166
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:19,969
the answer I I'm not the right person

167
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:22,279
asked to solve that problem I'm just the

168
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:26,029
person to ask to help whatever ideas you

169
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:28,189
have to solve the problem Thank You

170
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:32,120
Patrick Benson this next one is for you

171
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:33,889
can you elaborate on the experience and

172
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,430
skill set that you possess that would

173
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:42,050
help Nanog that would help make nanog

174
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:44,509
more successful well I have some

175
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,990
experience outside of Nanak

176
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:49,539
I won't recite my resume here but there

177
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,520
are a few experiences there that I think

178
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:54,889
translate well in particular organizing

179
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,549
groups of volunteers in let's say the

180
00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:00,169
IETF or in other volunteer organizations

181
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,849
everything that happens here I mean

182
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:04,008
don't get me wrong the staff makes

183
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:05,659
everything happen here but it is really

184
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,129
driven by the direction that the

185
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:10,909
volunteer board and the volunteer

186
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:12,680
program committee bring so I think

187
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:13,998
frankly that's the main thing I'll be

188
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,899
able to bring is the ability to bring

189
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:20,719
people together to lead without pushing

190
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:22,639
find a good balance there I think also

191
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:25,399
there's some things that Nanog needs to

192
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,680
consider and some of them I have more or

193
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:30,469
less experience with but ways to bring

194
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,389
more education it may be even formal

195
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:35,389
education or certification I I don't

196
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:38,149
know the answer there I think also

197
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:41,479
better tools for bringing people

198
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:43,039
together we we have to build on what the

199
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,870
other two have said you know we have a

200
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,639
room of people some of whom have known

201
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,260
each other for a long time some of whom

202
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,170
are new and don't know how to get into

203
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,910
the sort of into the club right I think

204
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,680
there are things we can do to make that

205
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,219
easier the newcomers lunch is certainly

206
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,349
one of them

207
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,970
but there are maybe other tools that I

208
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,740
have some experience with I think we

209
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,560
should bring to the to the community

210
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:07,040
thank you for your response I'm gonna

211
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,018
tap you again for another question which

212
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,599
of these potential topics would keep you

213
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:14,139
up at night as a board member

214
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,699
neiha nog meeting sizes diversity

215
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:23,449
educational outreach and financial

216
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:24,469
solvency all of them I think to be to be

217
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:26,660
fair the one I would worry about the

218
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,269
least is the attendance right I mean if

219
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,430
we put on a good if we put on a good

220
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,990
present a good program and we we have

221
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,209
good reasons for people to be here

222
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:39,139
people will come as much as the economy

223
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:41,060
enables so I think that would be my

224
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:44,060
least concern but if we start to dip off

225
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:47,060
that brings my concern up in the area of

226
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,910
finances right we are we're driven by

227
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,008
sponsorships we're driven by members and

228
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,899
the money that that we the members pay

229
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,730
if membership starts going down

230
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,860
sponsorship starts going down right we

231
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:01,189
we could we could be in a bad spot we're

232
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,110
not there right now as far as I know so

233
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:05,750
I wouldn't worry too much I think in

234
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,870
terms of what I would focus the most on

235
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,279
in the next few years would be diversity

236
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:14,449
inclusion bringing in that next

237
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:17,149
generation Thank You Brad this next one

238
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:19,128
is for you what your top what are your

239
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:25,029
top three initiatives you think Nanog

240
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:27,980
should focus on so personally I think

241
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:33,399
the big three for me right now in asti

242
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:38,000
is I'd like to see us bring younger

243
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:40,639
engineers into the mix I think right now

244
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,220
Nano does a great job as it is right now

245
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:46,339
reaching out putting on a great program

246
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,920
the PC we've everyone on the PC is put

247
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:51,110
in countless hours reviewing size

248
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,000
presentations we have a great program I

249
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,399
would like to see that program open up

250
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,309
and start focusing on bringing in new

251
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,160
blood into the industry a lot of us have

252
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:02,480
been around for a while we need to have

253
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,509
back fill I think that really needs to

254
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,730
happen the other initiative I think we

255
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:08,199
should really be focusing on

256
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,589
ties into bringing in the new blood

257
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:13,870
would be diversity and inclusion it is a

258
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:17,980
big topic that I think we need to focus

259
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,899
on the third eye I may get some pushback

260
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,790
from people on it I think we should be

261
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:24,459
focusing on changing our meeting

262
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:26,290
structures a little bit I know this goes

263
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:27,910
against a lot of people's viewpoints but

264
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,430
I think three three meetings a years too

265
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,540
many we're gonna reach a point where I

266
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,550
think our program is going to start

267
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,300
getting watered down because we're

268
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:39,069
trying to meet this three meeting a year

269
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,760
deadline and filling a program full of

270
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,490
talks

271
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,660
I think it might be too much and person

272
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:46,029
I think we should maybe looking at maybe

273
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:50,589
a biannual meeting as opposed to three

274
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:51,939
times a year thank you this next

275
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:54,399
question is for all three of you and

276
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:58,920
I'll start with Patrick what is your

277
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,920
most memorable Nanog moment or meeting

278
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,600
old I don't remember them all

279
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:12,120
but I personally think that the

280
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:15,339
hurricane Electric cake was pretty good

281
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:23,380
that was that was kind of memorable kind

282
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:26,649
of awesome Thank You Brad okay there

283
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:30,189
have been a few I don't even remember

284
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:34,000
the Nanog numbers anymore on which one

285
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,589
it was I think if I was to tie it all

286
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,149
together I would save the friendships

287
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:40,120
that I've gathered from attending

288
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:43,209
Nanak's I've met more people face to

289
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,040
face than I've ever have and built long

290
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:46,569
lasting friendships from attending the

291
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:52,839
meetings and I think that's my biggest

292
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:54,519
takeaway from all of you so this is easy

293
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,010
because there's one that stands out and

294
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:00,279
it was my first Nanog meeting as I said

295
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,480
a bit ago my company sponsored it and I

296
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,360
was tapped as the guy to make the

297
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,510
network work and it turns out that at

298
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,899
that hotel I mean it was a mess from top

299
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:12,970
to bottom I I had to run cross connects

300
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:15,850
I'm not exaggerating next to a urinal in

301
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,709
a men's room it was an access panel on

302
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:21,160
the wall it was a it was a strange

303
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:22,930
couple days but that was a lot of fun I

304
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,730
mean you know the in the trenches

305
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,479
building the network thing especially

306
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:30,100
you know you know a venue like like this

307
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,750
it was cool and collaborating with the

308
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,010
the knock at the time and the folks who

309
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,130
were involved from staff from the United

310
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:40,120
staff everything was it was a great

311
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:41,680
experience thank you my next question is

312
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,040
going to be for Patrick and this is a

313
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,290
two-part question what have you have you

314
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,260
brought participants into Nanog

315
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:52,719
community or mentored new network and

316
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,880
professionals in your day job how could

317
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,910
you help nanog reach the next generation

318
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,130
of networking professionals have I

319
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,290
brought people here many people lots of

320
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,420
people some people in this room I have

321
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,219
I'm entered people I've tried you know

322
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:11,500
weather or successful or not is up to

323
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:14,110
them to say but I I go out of my way to

324
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:18,069
make sure that the people who are trying

325
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,149
hard if they don't if they're they don't

326
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:21,399
have the knowledge or they don't have

327
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,569
the experience or they they don't know

328
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:24,639
what they're doing but they're trying

329
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:25,779
and they're looking for answers I got on

330
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,579
my way to try and help them because

331
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:30,160
that's the best way to get people

332
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:31,899
comfortable to be here right and it's

333
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,019
it's a little bit of a meritocracy it's

334
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:36,639
a little bit of a ego fest but in

335
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:38,560
general people feel more comfortable

336
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,420
when they actually feel they have a good

337
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,430
grasp of the subject matter at hand and

338
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,660
so I want to make sure everyone feels

339
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,989
comfortable asking questions and

340
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,939
everyone gets the answers without

341
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:52,120
feeling condescended - how do we bring

342
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:53,560
more people in here as I mentioned at

343
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,300
the beginning it's a lot harder these

344
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,268
days because you know some budgets are

345
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,949
tighter and companies are bigger and so

346
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:01,630
if you have an engineering staff of

347
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:02,800
three like we did in the 90s a lot of

348
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,730
time than sending three people is not a

349
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,819
big deal if you have an inch

350
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:08,769
you staff of 300 then you know you might

351
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,529
not go to an a dog for 10 years right

352
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:13,329
and I think one of the ways to do that

353
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:15,160
I'm very proud of the things that we've

354
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,540
done with you know the educational

355
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,480
outreach we've done getting the students

356
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,060
in here we just had a student ask a

357
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,800
question and by the way Brad told me

358
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,018
this I'm not trying to take credit but

359
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,389
he pointed out that we just had a

360
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:31,000
student asked a question at a keynote of

361
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:33,010
Paul vixie I don't know if the guy knows

362
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,529
who public C was but you know that's

363
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:39,180
that's huge that's enormous it's very

364
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:41,399
different than normal and I like that

365
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,199
everyone feels comfortable doing that

366
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,510
more ways to get people involved I'm not

367
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:48,310
sure we're working on that but most of

368
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,709
our most of our efforts tend to

369
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,268
concentrate on the education side I'd

370
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,130
like to see us move a little bit more

371
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:55,990
into like how to junior knock Tech's get

372
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,490
here and I'm not sure how to answer that

373
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:02,380
question yet but it's something we

374
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:06,550
should work on thank you my next

375
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,810
question is for Brad strategically what

376
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,269
do you think are the biggest

377
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:13,989
opportunities or challenges for nanog as

378
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:15,459
an organization and what qualities do

379
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:18,790
you bring to the Board of Directors to

380
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:24,130
ensure a successful outcome for a nanog

381
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:26,980
membership can you repeat that first

382
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,209
part again I'm sorry strategically what

383
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,940
do you think are the biggest

384
00:16:28,209 --> 00:16:34,510
opportunities or challenges for Nanog as

385
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:36,040
an organization and what qualities do

386
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:39,370
you bring to the Board of Directors to

387
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:43,449
ensure a successful outcome for the

388
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:45,399
Nanog membership well so I would think

389
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:47,589
right now some of the biggest without

390
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,569
having purview what's actually been

391
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,579
dealt with on the board I think some of

392
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:53,469
the biggest issues I personally could

393
00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:56,439
see would be maintaining our attendance

394
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:59,980
and growth bringing in new people and

395
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,470
then also how do we get sponsorship how

396
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:06,309
do we get new companies to donate money

397
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:08,020
to sponsor events how do we focus on

398
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:10,720
that how do we continue doing what we're

399
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,540
doing that's I think that's the biggest

400
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,929
focus again without having purview of

401
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,299
what

402
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:19,779
happens in the board and then bringing

403
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:20,799
in the college students and the

404
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:22,720
immersion that we're working on with the

405
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,168
college to college version I think it's

406
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:30,879
gonna be a big focus to your second part

407
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:33,279
what I bring I bring I think a different

408
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,779
perspective I come from a completely

409
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:38,909
different background completely

410
00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:43,869
different focus i happenstance fell into

411
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:46,110
the internet business was just dumb luck

412
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:48,189
fell into it and fell in love with it I

413
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,059
think I bring a different perspective I

414
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:53,860
come from a completely different

415
00:17:49,059 --> 00:18:00,940
background that hopefully will bring new

416
00:17:53,860 --> 00:18:02,918
ideas to nanog but then again my ideas

417
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,470
may not be the best so what I can do is

418
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:09,879
I can bring support I've been on the PC

419
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:13,570
now for three four years something like

420
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:15,248
that so I've been a part of Nanog I want

421
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,658
to do it no matter what if whatever

422
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:18,309
happened to the election I'm still going

423
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:20,289
to try to volunteer and help out as much

424
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:22,590
as I can I want to see this organization

425
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:24,990
to succeed and continue to put on

426
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:28,600
fantastic conferences going forward

427
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:31,899
thank you very much Benson this next

428
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,789
question is for you what role should

429
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:36,399
Nanog play in developing the next

430
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:39,820
generation of network engineers and what

431
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:45,100
could the Nanog board do to ensure that

432
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:48,399
our community pardon me what could the

433
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:52,449
Nanog board do to ensure they see our

434
00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:54,758
community as a positive as positive

435
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:57,789
diverse and inclusive sorry that was

436
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:59,350
mouthful that's good it's actually I

437
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:02,289
think one of the hardest questions and

438
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:04,600
most important for Nana to address I

439
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:07,590
have some ideas I don't know that

440
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:11,289
they're the right ones but as an example

441
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:13,840
we historically a focused nanog on the

442
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:15,700
meeting nanog the mailing list has been

443
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,549
a huge resource for so many people but

444
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,169
not everyone in our industry focuses on

445
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:24,039
email anymore and frankly most of my

446
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:26,230
email is trash right I think there might

447
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,620
be other ways we have sort of the

448
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,360
building blocks and our website

449
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,949
with the profile tool and membership and

450
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,320
and things like that we we might have

451
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:36,230
building blocks there that we could add

452
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,610
to to create other ways for people to

453
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,840
get involved in analog even if they're

454
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,029
not at the meeting

455
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,908
maybe access to more educational

456
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:45,830
material online the ability to establish

457
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:47,210
small groups you know to find people

458
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:49,399
that are like-minded have the same

459
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,740
interest I don't know all the details

460
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,960
but at a high high level I think there

461
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,159
are a lot of opportunities there outside

462
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,880
of the meeting and that's that's

463
00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:00,830
probably where I would focus Thank You

464
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,440
Patrick if this next one is for you

465
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:07,639
how would you encourage community

466
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:10,669
engagement community engagement that's a

467
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,890
good question I think we're a pretty

468
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:14,299
engaged community one of the things I

469
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:15,860
like about now is it's not twenty

470
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:16,789
thousand people so you know you walk

471
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,320
down the hall and you actually recognize

472
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:21,289
half or more of the people if you've

473
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,178
been here a few times I I think that the

474
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:24,799
the non-board and honestly we went to

475
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:27,020
the membership and asked them but they

476
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,970
agreed to make sure that there was a

477
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,700
social a good social put on at every

478
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:34,250
single dialog is important I think it's

479
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,390
I think it's good to get out of you know

480
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,409
everybody sitting there staring at your

481
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,820
laptops instead of watching the

482
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:40,880
presentation yes I see all of you doing

483
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:43,070
that right now and get into a social

484
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,870
setting and you know whether you have a

485
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:47,720
drink or just talk to each other just be

486
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,860
outside of this hallway conversations

487
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,190
are great but let's get everybody into

488
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:55,070
another place but you know like that's

489
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,210
was saying and again old dude so maybe

490
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,149
I'm not the right person to answer this

491
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,520
but the the kids these days get off my

492
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:05,449
lawn have new ways of engaging you know

493
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:09,350
whether it's I don't know chat rooms or

494
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,970
Instagram or whatever else it is getting

495
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:15,250
something so that there is a way to

496
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:17,510
communicate between people and lubricate

497
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:20,450
individual one talking to individual two

498
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:22,820
without resistance is very very

499
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,289
important how we do that we've already

500
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,639
tried a few different ways some of them

501
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:28,850
failed some of them worked we should

502
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,770
keep trying to get each and every one of

503
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,908
the community not just the people in

504
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,168
this room or the people of the

505
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:34,880
conference but everybody in the

506
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:39,409
community to be able to talk to somebody

507
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:43,000
else efficiently and without roadblocks

508
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:45,649
in their way Thank You Patrick

509
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,710
this next question is for you Benson and

510
00:21:45,649 --> 00:21:50,658
this is a two-part question again how

511
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:55,190
would you describe the nanog community

512
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:58,159
to a newcomer to Nanog what is special

513
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:02,570
and unique how can they make new

514
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:04,250
professional connections so I probably

515
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:08,090
honestly start off by saying it's a

516
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:10,159
bunch of old white dudes and you know as

517
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,199
a way to break the ice and the tension

518
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,380
around introducing yourself you know get

519
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,140
in front of people say hello I mean I

520
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:20,059
know for myself going to any new event

521
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:23,240
where I don't know people it's it's not

522
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:26,480
it's not fun so I think helping people

523
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,070
get sort of past that barrier finding

524
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,240
people that are like them or people that

525
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,220
aren't going to be nice to them answer

526
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,880
questions introduce them to other people

527
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,899
I think I think that's a key if you

528
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,840
could remind me the second part of your

529
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:40,699
question what is special and unique how

530
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,149
can they make new professional

531
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,830
connections oh well I think I almost

532
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:50,780
answered that with my first answer but

533
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:52,280
you know this community I mean these are

534
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:55,370
the people who make the internet work

535
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,539
some of these people sell things to the

536
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,729
people who make the internet work right

537
00:22:56,539 --> 00:23:02,570
meters there's a very concentrated set

538
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:06,320
of maybe arcane knowledge at these

539
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:08,780
events I think if you if you attend

540
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,549
nanog for that yeah you know for that

541
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,649
content for that set of relationships

542
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:17,470
and knowledge you can make the most of

543
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:18,830
it I'm not sure I have much more read

544
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,370
that's good

545
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:25,580
thank you our last question and I'm it's

546
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:27,590
just for you Brad what makes you stand

547
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,970
out as a potential new member of the

548
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,970
board of directors

549
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:39,440
that's kind of a difficult question

550
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:40,820
don't like talking about myself what

551
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,670
makes you stand out I think if anything

552
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:48,230
is my drive to see this organization

553
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:51,380
succeed I've put a lot of time and hours

554
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:53,059
into the program committee previously

555
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,230
the communication communication

556
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:56,600
committee that we used to have before we

557
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,780
disbanded it I have put a lot of time

558
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:02,240
and effort into making sure this isn't a

559
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:04,580
successful event every time we have a

560
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,980
meeting I want to put that same Drive

561
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:10,250
and focus into making a nog the best it

562
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:12,530
could be I think something that I bring

563
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:16,340
to the table is a different outlook on

564
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:20,629
how we continue down this path I think I

565
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:22,010
bring a new viewpoint in because I've

566
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:24,980
come from a complete of a background I

567
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:27,379
have different viewpoints I focus on

568
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,960
different things than other members of

569
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,630
the board currently future members I

570
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,490
think just my diverse background will

571
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:38,809
bring new blood into Nanog thank you

572
