1
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:18,810
good afternoon my name is - so I'm a

2
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,979
principal engine Network engine and

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,959
manager for my close up

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,330
asier so I would like to take this

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,990
opportunity to talk about what we have

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,028
done to migrate a bunch of regions to

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,128
from all data so architecture to new

8
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,230
architectures and some of the challenges

9
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:39,000
that we face and some of the tools and

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:41,730
we put together so let me pull up put

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,629
out the problem statements but for the

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,569
last five years

13
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:49,289
I should have been going for going 10 X

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,590
so we have to actually migrate a lot of

15
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,870
infrastructure to new infrastructures so

16
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,920
question is how do you actually test on

17
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:02,010
mob so here's some of the criteria I

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,860
think everyone's would kind of agreed so

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,289
we are 24/7 business so we don't have

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,970
any downtime for any customer so when we

21
00:01:07,289 --> 00:01:11,039
do migrations we also look at the

22
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,390
traffic volume as well the volume is

23
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:15,539
pretty much the same for every single

24
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,709
day so there's no lower volume day that

25
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:20,720
week I should go and choose to do

26
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:23,399
migrations and the criteria for us is

27
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,530
when we do the migrations we cannot

28
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:27,899
actually impact a customer because they

29
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,330
are twenty four sevenths some of the

30
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:32,759
challenge on our end is this migration

31
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,849
need to be repeats for 30-plus regions

32
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,319
so we need to have scaled out to form

33
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:39,660
our purple team to help us to do

34
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,979
migrations so how can we actually

35
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:47,179
guarantee the quality of the migrations

36
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:50,039
so let's talk about a mop method of

37
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:53,310
operations so traditionally what we do

38
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:55,500
is we figure to figure out idea of how

39
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,869
we want to do the migrations we go into

40
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,660
lab get a few devices put together do

41
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,789
some testing so we do like unit testing

42
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,530
so test on one boxes make sure the

43
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:08,598
command work make sure there's no syntax

44
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,919
errors we do some small-scale testing by

45
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:13,109
replicate the post production network

46
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:16,649
using small imported wises connecting

47
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,180
together trying to see does the mob as

48
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,400
you make sense if you execute that

49
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,440
sequin of step which actually caused an

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,890
expected impact

51
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,840
right then we go to production say okay

52
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,390
we go to the staging production we try

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,790
it if it doesn't work we go back and try

54
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,850
again so when we think about this

55
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,959
approach to us is not good enough it's

56
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,880
not acceptable

57
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,400
because we don't want it testing

58
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,670
productions we don't want it as using

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,740
customer traffic so what do we do

60
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,299
so a couple of others that have come

61
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,740
together and think about what can we

62
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,770
actually how can we actually solve these

63
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,650
problems so what if we can actually

64
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:58,110
create emanated replica production

65
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,120
Network then we can actually test out

66
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,390
the whole mob and to end and even

67
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,060
automate the testing as well well if we

68
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:08,160
can hit a button hit a command we set

69
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,620
the environment and try different mob by

70
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,780
dear meaning I can try different way to

71
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,410
actually do certain things and give our

72
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:20,610
age the impact and try again try again

73
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:22,200
because it's all automated way and with

74
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,570
this kind of environments we can

75
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,220
actually go and practice so we can

76
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,010
actually have the engineer go and Pat is

77
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,209
a couple hundred times if they want make

78
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,920
sure they know extent of what they're

79
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,140
doing so they do a mental picture of the

80
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,149
mob we can't you bring in a new team

81
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,489
members from other team as well to

82
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,350
actually train them on the procedures so

83
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,820
when they go and do the migration this

84
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,590
is not the first time they actually look

85
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,200
at the mob this is not the first time

86
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,500
they look at the devices there's not the

87
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,540
first time that you look at the tunings

88
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,810
so at the end we build something we call

89
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,829
open network emulator so we were able to

90
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,540
create a replica of a production network

91
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,520
in some instant we have about five out

92
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,890
of five thousand router in that web

93
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:09,709
applications and we use it for testing

94
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,708
so we get into a little bit details

95
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:17,230
so thing about it so you fear for memory

96
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,860
of gns3 so this is thing about this is

97
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:23,170
gns3 that deploy in the tower and wow

98
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,570
man that you can scale so that is what

99
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:27,160
this is what that is thing about your

100
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,930
productions we have the hardware we have

101
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,880
software we have configurations so we

102
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,090
took the hard way out we virtualize it

103
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,850
put it on on top of ashes and run in

104
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,429
real network OS that we are using in

105
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:43,440
productions and push our configuration

106
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,440
to it so that how we create environments

107
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:51,640
so here is a detail pictures so in our

108
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,020
data center we actually describe our

109
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,909
production network using a lot of

110
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,650
meditators so we actually have a

111
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,380
blueprint before we actually build a

112
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:03,789
network so by using that data is that

113
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,980
you help us to do this create a replica

114
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:09,460
of our production network using them at

115
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:12,220
the data we create a software to go into

116
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,890
Azure we we have our own subscriptions

117
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:18,100
to go a naturist bring up a bunch of VMs

118
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:20,260
that we are networking OS on its example

119
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,540
today we support sonic which is our

120
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,789
in-house operation system that we have a

121
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:28,330
talk yesterday we support other vendor

122
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:31,480
as well cisco Western junipers so we

123
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:33,130
stood up the VMS we create over in

124
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,960
network to actually connect them

125
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:40,060
together according to how we connected

126
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,409
in production network we push the

127
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,000
configuration that we have from

128
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:48,160
productions to these virtualizer devices

129
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,230
and we have jump boxes that we can

130
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,730
actually run our tunings Windows Linux

131
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,980
different about your box different type

132
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,860
of two lanes so everything is set up

133
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:59,080
like this so imagine this is automated

134
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,090
so all I need to do is go in a portal

135
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,090
that we have and leaves of devices and

136
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,520
interested in emulators will fetch the

137
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,989
data from our metadata system to

138
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:12,400
actually all the interconnection between

139
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:14,800
all these devices and we will have a

140
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,909
jump box that you can log in by going

141
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,300
through the jump box you can actually

142
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,370
log into all these networking devices

143
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,860
the user experience from an hour

144
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,639
angel upon of you it just like normal

145
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,340
router we don't

146
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:31,180
I should see the different so that is

147
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:33,248
how the environment being set up so the

148
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,009
next one is the typical workflow that we

149
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:39,759
do do for the more validations so thing

150
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:41,740
about as a network engineer I can create

151
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,150
a where picker on the region that we

152
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,139
interested in doing migration work or

153
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,150
interest in doing a

154
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:49,270
testing the map idea or anything else

155
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:51,219
that you want to test we use our tools

156
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,620
to actually apply the configuration to

157
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:55,389
all the devices right for example your

158
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,370
mob have certain step you do certain

159
00:06:55,389 --> 00:07:00,599
things ship traffic away ship it back

160
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:05,279
and others so we execute the mob

161
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:08,710
automatically in their environment we

162
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:11,550
define a bunch of validation testing to

163
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:16,089
actually see the statue create impact

164
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:18,460
even every single step and if you have

165
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:21,339
hope if you find any problem which is

166
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,560
not expected so we have the output data

167
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:25,089
back to the user so the user can look at

168
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,610
and say oh that's that doesn't make a

169
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:29,740
lot of sense because we actually cut off

170
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,650
the deeper routes to the data center

171
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,479
which is pretty bad right so then the

172
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:36,219
user as you figure can go in and look at

173
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,688
the step and see what happened what's

174
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:39,550
going on they can actually log into the

175
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:41,439
virtual environment you do life

176
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,879
troubleshooting as well but remember

177
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,120
this is all virtual

178
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,469
so there's no customer impact so we can

179
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,240
actually repeat this a couple of times

180
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:50,830
we have automation helpers to actually

181
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,909
go and submit a mob to your executors

182
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,430
mob do the testing

183
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:56,469
give feedback to the users right if it

184
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:01,599
pass then we'll go to our cab and

185
00:07:56,469 --> 00:08:04,060
scheduled for production change so by

186
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,069
using these methods as I mention a

187
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,949
couple of things we can do we can wire

188
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:10,659
mop pass it through a system we can

189
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:12,300
catch all the syntax errors make sure

190
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:14,529
the command we put in as your work

191
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,430
different vendor different command so

192
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:20,740
that as you have a lot we can use it as

193
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,089
so testing environments for ideas so I'm

194
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,560
a thing about different way to ship

195
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:26,680
traffic I may think about different way

196
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,240
to move traffic around right I can

197
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,440
actually use this for testing to see

198
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,360
what is the control plane impacts and

199
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,059
and how does our tooling actual work as

200
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,830
well I mean our tunings scales in a

201
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:42,429
certain way we have any

202
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:44,590
tunings and this also also help us to

203
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:46,959
attribute training as well so if I get a

204
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:49,690
new engineer on board I can actually

205
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,150
sell a woman for him or her so and she

206
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:55,180
can actuate he or she can check all food

207
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,829
him up and go and execute he or she can

208
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,589
do it by hand so he can actually get a

209
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,030
sense of how I've been working she can i

210
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:04,060
he or she can actually do the show

211
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:06,699
command to understand more or how the

212
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,439
mob actual being created and the reason

213
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,330
behind them up as well so this is

214
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,700
extremely powerful because you have a

215
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:15,670
hand on aspect of running and migrations

216
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,050
one thing you don't want to see is the

217
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,310
person that you're one in a migration

218
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:23,319
the first time I should look at the mop

219
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:25,380
that is disaster that we've easily

220
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,840
become a disaster

221
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,360
so using this couple methods so we have

222
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,590
completed all the major migration for

223
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,390
the last two years so we have been

224
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,850
working on migration for the last two

225
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:39,880
years all the major migration already

226
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:42,250
completed so far just know custome

227
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,140
impacts there's no news on the internet

228
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:47,350
that actually have any problem so it's

229
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:50,590
good news for us we find a lot of bugs

230
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:52,200
from the needs of a couple of the more

231
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:55,660
planned the tooling so we find

232
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:59,260
configuration problems type all of the

233
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:02,770
commands I was our management's script

234
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:07,030
is have some boxes well we find some OS

235
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:13,210
problems that causing actually some we

236
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:15,430
are behavior and so as estimation if we

237
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,590
weaved out this system we can easily

238
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:23,469
cause about five different outages which

239
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:25,810
is quite a big outages so that is what I

240
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,930
want to talk about I will open up for

241
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,930
questions

242
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,090
okay so let me go to one slice I want to

243
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,580
call out so the the one network

244
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:46,530
emulation emulator the details are on

245
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,630
the link the presentation will be aware

246
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:52,020
about if you have any questions you can

247
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:54,990
email the ideas which is a software team

248
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:57,329
or if you have any questions on how to

249
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,030
use it user experience you can talk to

250
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:05,040
me I will be around as well

251
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:10,350
questions yes Petra staining is it

252
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:14,390
possible to use this open network

253
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:19,380
emulator for layer 2 stuff as well yes

254
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:21,390
so basically we are emanating the we are

255
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,730
connecting a bunch of VM together the VM

256
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,069
is a real OS ok right so you can

257
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,670
actually try that as well

258
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:31,650
great thanks I I haven't Blaine Williams

259
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,689
Juniper Networks I'm just curious

260
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,910
do you guys have any plans to proc ties

261
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,670
this for other folks around the room to

262
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:41,699
try to do this type of thing in Azure or

263
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:44,640
their setups yes so so eternally we have

264
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:53,120
a plan to open sources but unfortunately

265
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:53,120
I don't have the date yet thank you

266
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,569
you

267
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,000
you
