1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,049
I'm not sure I'll get through this in 30

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,960
minutes so I can start now girl do our

3
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:20,259
brief intro my name is Silva dart I'm

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,450
from Cisco obviously I work as a team me

5
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:25,180
and Cisco mostly focused on a network

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,488
architecture at Bennett Cisco for about

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,890
two and a half years but I spent around

8
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:32,439
I'll say 20 years working for service

9
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,230
providers so after two years I still

10
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:40,149
have some brain cells left but next year

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:42,269
they'll probably be gone the talk today

12
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:45,520
is really you know the intersection of

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,690
optical transport and routing and next

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,000
generation networks

15
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,500
I used the word intersection because

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,380
people have talked a lot in the past

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:56,470
about convergence between IP and optical

18
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,329
transport it really hasn't paid off that

19
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:00,190
much in the in the past but really this

20
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:01,960
is kind of a new way of looking at how

21
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:04,780
we converge those two networks in the

22
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,090
future kyv enabled by innovation that's

23
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,189
coming you know both on the optics side

24
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,020
as well as some things on the router

25
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:13,479
side that that's being done to really

26
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:17,740
enable a next-generation architecture

27
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:20,469
that's truly converged I've kind of a

28
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,658
quick agenda I will kind of take a brief

29
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:24,219
look at what current multi-layer network

30
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:26,229
architectures look like and that really

31
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:28,359
when I say multi layer I mean an IP

32
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:31,569
routed layer and then an underlying

33
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:33,038
transport optical transport layer and

34
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:34,600
what that looks like you know what that

35
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:36,399
design looks like what are some of the

36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,350
current issues with those types of

37
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,779
deployments then we'll take a brief look

38
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,189
at the next generation architecture you

39
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:43,899
know what the components are of that

40
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:45,609
what really are kind of the building

41
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:48,249
blocks that are enabling this in the

42
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:50,469
future and then you know time permitting

43
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:53,889
we'll look at a modeling example of a

44
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:56,229
real network to see how these this new

45
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:59,259
design stacks up to what we would say is

46
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:04,209
a existing or current multi-layer design

47
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:05,829
oh I'll take a step back you know in the

48
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:08,020
beginning and kind of talk a bit about

49
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:11,140
you know how to Paulo jeez have evolved

50
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,450
for IP networks over the years the first

51
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,970
IP networks from there deployed you know

52
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,920
really just hop-by-hop IP networks I

53
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,380
mean when I say hop I hop it really

54
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,500
means that a packet at a pack

55
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,600
lair and that would maybe originally

56
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,220
been deployed years ago using an ATM

57
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,200
network you know and we connected

58
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,800
routers via ATM networks but an ATM

59
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,260
network is still a packet network and

60
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,390
over time things evolved to have a

61
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,579
network where we needed to you know

62
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,769
potentially move away from having

63
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,990
traffic pass through every router and a

64
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,960
ring the main thing that drove that was

65
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,820
traffic demand and cost you know router

66
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,060
interfaces have been pretty expensive

67
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,280
for a long time so we found new ways or

68
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,330
novel ways to bypass router interfaces

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,550
based on a to Z traffic demands really

70
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,230
you know that the traffic demand you

71
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,580
know drives what the topology of the

72
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,489
network looks like or at least the

73
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,200
logical topology so that really drove

74
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,870
the need to have like an underlying

75
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,739
system you know that can make better use

76
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:17,130
of things like the fiber optic you know

77
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,990
transport between locations because like

78
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,299
I said that Roberts didn't really keep

79
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,760
up with capacity and they were also very

80
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,840
expensive to deploy in that sort of

81
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,790
hop-by-hop ring manner they really kind

82
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,920
of led to you know multi-layer networks

83
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:34,290
where I do have a separate optical

84
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,630
transport layer and then I have an IP

85
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,670
routed layer or packet layer on top of

86
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,070
that and those are typically deployed

87
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,690
today in you know two different ways the

88
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,390
one on the left there I called a router

89
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:48,209
plus MUX ponder model you call that IP

90
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,070
plus DWDM but that really kind of fits

91
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,020
the way many networks are deployed today

92
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,700
with a rod and layer and then a

93
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,459
completely separate photonic layer

94
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,929
underneath that where I'm using active

95
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,360
elements in that network so that's

96
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,270
that's with MUX Bonners it's with active

97
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,560
rotom's doing add drop and there may be

98
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,450
other components in there such as

99
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,360
amplifiers that are used for longer

100
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,579
distances another method of deploying

101
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,440
this is you know what we call IP / WD a

102
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,510
you know the difference between these

103
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,060
two is with that you know router + MUX

104
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,250
ponder model the wavelength on that

105
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,580
network is being launched by the optical

106
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,280
transport system and the DW WDM model

107
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,810
it's being done on the router itself and

108
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,059
we still see a lot of deployments of

109
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,090
that mainly in lower speed networks

110
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,950
access networks

111
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:38,159
they you know utilizing things like CWDM

112
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,890
and DWDM with you know 10-gig optics and

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,800
now we're seeing more with 100 Gig 200

114
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:45,780
gig you know kind of see a PD Co but

115
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,970
still mainly in I'll say lower speed

116
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,880
aggregation networks are not really high

117
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,460
bandwidth Metro regional and long haul

118
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,440
backbone networks we also see a lot of

119
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,049
this in DCI where there's a shorter

120
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,060
reaches involved you know between those

121
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,550
different router elements so we've seen

122
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,220
things like 100 gig you know Pam for

123
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,900
optics become you know popular yeah for

124
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,490
DCI

125
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:11,520
recently but not really used in metro

126
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,620
regional or long-haul networks here's a

127
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,450
bit of kind of a linear view what these

128
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,070
different connectivity types look like

129
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,690
and I'm not going to read through all

130
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,190
the bullet points but you know it's

131
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,140
really you have connections over a dark

132
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,120
fiber you know and obviously that's just

133
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,669
connecting two routers back-to-back over

134
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,290
standard optics or they may be long

135
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,170
reach optics of some sort if you have a

136
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,850
longer distance involved but it doesn't

137
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,410
make the best utilization over a piece

138
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,600
of fiber or it doesn't make the best

139
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,820
resource utilization utilization of

140
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,550
fiber which is a fairly expensive

141
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,320
resource you're really limited to just

142
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,230
the speed you have in those those two

143
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,400
optics they never connect those routers

144
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,590
the second type is the one that I just

145
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,780
spent a bit of time talking about and

146
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,340
the way that most I'll say a higher

147
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,229
bandwidth networks that are deployed

148
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,330
today when you look at regional and

149
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,400
long-haul networks to really maximize

150
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,400
you know what you get out of a piece of

151
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,140
fiber and that does have multiple active

152
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,760
elements where I do have a transponder I

153
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,880
have a Rotom that's grooming that

154
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,400
traffic on to the fiber and you can see

155
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,860
kind of in the you know transceiver view

156
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,960
there the number of optics I need to

157
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,570
complete that connection end-to-end

158
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,729
you know I have a typically a great

159
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,200
optic connection back to back gray optic

160
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,290
connection between a router and a

161
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,849
transponder or MUX bonder and typically

162
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,770
you know you're either have a some sort

163
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:32,220
of you know these days there might be a

164
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:35,010
CFP to DCO or a co optic out of a

165
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,020
transponder shelf or it may be an

166
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,390
integrated you know kind of photonic

167
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,219
interface that's actually putting that

168
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:43,140
wavelength out to go onto the piece of

169
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,730
fiber but there's a lot of components

170
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,520
that are involved in that that

171
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,260
with Network it uses more power and

172
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,270
obviously you know from a space power

173
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,710
efficiency perspective you know it's

174
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,630
it's a lot more that we're doing over a

175
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:58,680
dark fiber but you do unlock the fourth

176
00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:00,870
capacity of that piece of fiber IP over

177
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,150
WDM again you know there's no

178
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,500
transponders involved in this the

179
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,080
wavelengths are launched off of the

180
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,850
router itself in this use case I just

181
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,770
have kind of a simple MUX that's you

182
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,970
know connecting those two elements it

183
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,340
still allows me to get better

184
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,860
utilization out of the fiber between

185
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,469
those two endpoints but without all the

186
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,390
active elements that are involved but in

187
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,540
this case you know I can't bypass one

188
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,340
router through a Rotom I'm every hop is

189
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:30,840
you know point-to-point between the two

190
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:32,789
routers so what are some of the issues

191
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,940
with these current kind of IP Plus

192
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,160
optical and IP plus DDM DWDM deployments

193
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,630
and this is these aren't new bullet

194
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,190
points if you've looked at anything

195
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,260
around you know packet off to a

196
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,740
convergence in the last you know 10 or

197
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,180
so years these kind of ponies come up

198
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,070
the big one is that I'm operating you

199
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,900
know multiple kind of opaque networks

200
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,120
you know if I'm using back-to-back gray

201
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,489
optics between a transponder and a

202
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,020
router there's really no information

203
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,970
sharing they're completely different

204
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,240
control planes between those two

205
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:05,040
networks typically on the transport side

206
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,800
the control planes are you know wholly

207
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,830
proprietary you know we we had these

208
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,040
this notion of using gmpls and G MPLS

209
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,599
has been worked on for many many years

210
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,730
never really kind of satisfied its

211
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,160
original goals of creating this kind of

212
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:22,230
multi-layer control plane that we could

213
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,910
use between those two layers so today

214
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,160
there isn't much work done between the

215
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,780
router layer and the the transport layer

216
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,390
and trying to make those elements talk

217
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,429
to each other something that's probably

218
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:35,130
a bit newer is this notion of different

219
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:37,469
protection schemes something you know

220
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,140
optical restoration which is restoring a

221
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:42,390
circuit on the optical network you know

222
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,710
so it does not go down on the rugged

223
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,480
network you know it's become a little

224
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:48,210
bit more popular but when you restore

225
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,850
paths on an alternative you know fiber

226
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:53,490
path the router network really has no

227
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,320
idea you know what that path is you know

228
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,720
if you're doing you know constraint

229
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,879
based routing where you're

230
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,790
and ano shared risk linked groups or

231
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,170
paths disjointness for services it's

232
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,750
very hard to share information between

233
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,189
those two different layers yes you end

234
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,980
up with mismatch protection and

235
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:11,629
potentially in certain failure cases you

236
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,600
know your service is going to go down we

237
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:16,970
don't expect it and then just

238
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,189
organizational silos and time their

239
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,500
speed to actually turn up services or

240
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:24,889
turn up circuits in many organizations

241
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,050
there's a separate IP group from a

242
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:29,149
transport group there's a few where

243
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,649
those are combined groups but very often

244
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:32,360
they're different Operations teams

245
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:34,850
they're different engineering teams or

246
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,100
different architecture teams so it takes

247
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,629
a lot of work in order to plan those

248
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,490
networks to engineer them and then

249
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:42,230
ultimately operate them and you're

250
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,209
typically duplicating some of the same

251
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:48,920
tasks over and over when it comes to

252
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:51,319
those those planning functions so this

253
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,899
is kind of the the fancy 3d model of you

254
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:55,729
know what a lot of these I'll say higher

255
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:58,160
bandwidth IP networks look like today

256
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,959
and it's really two layers you do have

257
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,870
that routed layer that's connected via

258
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:04,309
gray optics to this Rotem layer within

259
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,949
the Rotem layer really is what gives you

260
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:09,769
any any any - any connectivity between

261
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:12,079
the routers on that network I make the

262
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:14,930
point of this this network does not have

263
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,239
you know OTN services on it if you're

264
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,920
using OTN you know just add another

265
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,559
layer to the network that's sandwiched

266
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,110
in between the routed layer and the

267
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,959
underlying you know optical transport

268
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,699
layer so that's you know I said if you

269
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,069
had that OTN layer it just adds more

270
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:34,089
complexity to the network at least

271
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:36,589
that's that's my world view on on OTN

272
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:38,120
but you know so how does this evolve

273
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:40,279
like how does this change and how do we

274
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,459
kind of how would we look at building

275
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,559
networks in the future sort of the the

276
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:47,209
second one and this is kind of where

277
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:49,550
we're focused in the future on you know

278
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:51,258
how we build really kind of high

279
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,809
bandwidth next networks in the future

280
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:56,750
and you see that this is no longer has

281
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:59,149
that Rotem layer underneath it is just a

282
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:01,430
bunch of interconnected routers with

283
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:03,920
those wavelengths being launched off of

284
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:06,589
the routers people who don't like me to

285
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,240
call this IP over DWDM at Cisco but

286
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:10,470
really that's that's what it is

287
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,139
so it's a reimagining of that

288
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:15,779
but you know with innovations it doesn't

289
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,759
have the the drawbacks of the previous

290
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:20,129
iterations of this and I'll explain it a

291
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,709
bit more of that on the in the follow in

292
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:23,819
the following slides but most people

293
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:25,378
look at this it looks like a lot of

294
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:28,459
Cisco routers and we're just trying to

295
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:30,750
sell you more router ports which is true

296
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:32,459
but we're also an optical transport

297
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,319
vendor so we're talking about

298
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:39,420
eliminating those layers for good

299
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:42,810
reasons let's put it that way I think

300
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,550
some of my icons left the slide here but

301
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,410
so when we look at that and not go back

302
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:49,500
so you know I really call this a single

303
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:51,000
layer hop-by-hop fabric so you'll see

304
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,829
people at Cisco uses a term hop-by-hop

305
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,500
this is kind of really what we mean is

306
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:58,529
this single packet layer unified packet

307
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,850
layer without the Rotem network and this

308
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:02,069
is really talked about like what's left

309
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,889
of that optical transport network when I

310
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:06,959
move to this type of architecture you

311
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:09,029
still have you know see band and L band

312
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,920
multiplexers we want to make the most

313
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:13,319
efficient use of the fiber that we have

314
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,479
so we still need multiplexers to put

315
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:17,910
those signals on the fiber you're still

316
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,980
gonna have amplifiers you may have local

317
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,990
amplifiers where you need them you have

318
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,480
ila if your distances are greater than

319
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,279
you know say 80 kilometers you still

320
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,110
need amplifiers in this solution you

321
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,439
know that's not magic we haven't solved

322
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,579
those issues so you still have some

323
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:33,959
portions of the photonic network what

324
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,849
you don't have is you don't have MUX

325
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:38,579
ponders you don't have transponders that

326
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:41,339
function has been built into the the

327
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:43,349
router optic well you also don't have as

328
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:45,810
a Rotem network so there's no any to any

329
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:48,149
you know multi degree wrote of network

330
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,008
that you're using anymore the switching

331
00:12:48,149 --> 00:12:52,259
all goes through the IP and packet

332
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:54,899
devices you also don't have to worry

333
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:57,089
about region and some people may say

334
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:59,519
well a router is a really fancy region

335
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:01,319
and that's absolutely true you know so

336
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,269
but you no longer have to worry about

337
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:05,790
that at the photonic layer of the

338
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:07,769
network you know since I am hop-by-hop

339
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:12,000
between routers I no longer have to

340
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:13,949
worry about that at least of the last

341
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,810
kind of horrible point should be things

342
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:19,380
they aren't in the net

343
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:21,060
anymore I get this question so I

344
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,529
mentioned convergence and convergence

345
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,589
being something that people have talked

346
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:28,110
about many times over the past you know

347
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:29,430
10 to 15 years and how they weekend you

348
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,560
know either emerged these networks

349
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:34,380
either at layer 3 through things like IP

350
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,540
over at DWDM you know cisco did this

351
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,770
with the the crs many years ago and

352
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,140
there were large networks that were

353
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:42,860
built using these 40 gauge line cards

354
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:45,960
the reason this really didn't you know

355
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,820
made it didn't I'll say continued to be

356
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,290
mainstream and a lot of networks is

357
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,660
really kind of the bottom bullet point

358
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,400
is is density there's always a density

359
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,339
penalty with using these types of

360
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,740
interfaces and routers and it's that's

361
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,540
always been the case and and that's

362
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,550
really that the main problem in the

363
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,680
future that we're innovating to solve is

364
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,479
that did not really have a density

365
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,199
penalty when you look at these types of

366
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,029
optics and routers the other thing is

367
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,339
cost you know router cost is pretty

368
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:17,040
expensive IP interfaces in the past were

369
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,839
pretty expensive you know so bypassing

370
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,660
those routers on the photonic layer was

371
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,850
was a more inexpensive proposition it

372
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,620
followed the traffic demands that that I

373
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,200
needed it sliced that everything you

374
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,810
know generally comes down to density and

375
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,060
cost and I measured a little bit earlier

376
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,439
around router capacity with a lot of the

377
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,050
really high bandwidth networks we have

378
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,300
today I maybe I couldn't simply build a

379
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:41,099
hop-by-hop ring based Network because

380
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,740
routers didn't have the capacity and to

381
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,810
end to fulfill those bandwidth needs and

382
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,640
I think with the the advancements in the

383
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,560
future and things like 400 gig that I'll

384
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,780
talk about we finally kind of unlocked

385
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,270
the capacity we need to make this more

386
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,730
applicable on a wide scale outside of

387
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:59,640
you know specific kind of niche

388
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:01,800
applications you know so what are some

389
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,870
of the short benefits you get out of

390
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,719
going to that you know single layer

391
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,610
hop-by-hop architecture you know things

392
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,740
protection is is all done with the IP

393
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,959
layer and that's kind of an easy easy

394
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:15,000
given one in many networks today they do

395
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,640
all of their protection and restoration

396
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,320
at the IP layer anyways I would say the

397
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,240
majority of networks do but if you are

398
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,400
using something like optical protection

399
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,600
and restoration this simplifies that

400
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,009
quite a bit

401
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,470
um I P network utilization and that's

402
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:33,290
kind of the stat Marx equation if I'm

403
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:35,839
using bypass with high capacity circuits

404
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,339
like 100 Gig and 400 gig I'm really

405
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,249
building a lot of capacity to that I'm

406
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:41,810
that I'm not potentially utilizing if I

407
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:44,180
get if I build things in more a

408
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,040
hop-by-hop manner then I can get the

409
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,219
gains of staff muxing at every hop

410
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,599
across that network wavelength

411
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,980
efficiency and I've got a slot next

412
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,129
slide about that that I'll explain a

413
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,600
little bit you know how that works

414
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:58,249
obviously simplifying network operations

415
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,499
if you're eliminating layers of the

416
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:02,480
network that network you know should be

417
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:04,579
easier to operate it's easier for me to

418
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,860
stand up here and say that and we have

419
00:16:04,579 --> 00:16:08,449
to find ways to make networks easier to

420
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,329
operate and that's you know things that

421
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:14,359
were continuing to work on and hand in

422
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:16,128
ham and that goes into faster turn up if

423
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,230
I don't have to you know talk to the

424
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:20,470
transport guy or open a transport ticket

425
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:23,079
to get a new circuit between two routers

426
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:26,480
obviously that makes things much faster

427
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:28,189
when it doesn't solve and this is you

428
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,980
know I think you can't completely get

429
00:16:28,189 --> 00:16:32,870
rid of the optical transport guys you

430
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,610
still need to do wavelength planning

431
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,930
there may be less of it

432
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,670
you still need to figure out which

433
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,229
wavelengths go between each router you

434
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,889
still need to you know figure out how

435
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,430
that works

436
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:46,550
you still have to manage you know

437
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:48,290
multiplexing equipment amplifiers so you

438
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,240
know you still need people with the

439
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,519
knowledge of that photonic network that

440
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,110
know how to manage that and the last

441
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:56,300
bullet point is really around you know

442
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,879
there's a lot of services that that ride

443
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,769
over some current networks other than

444
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,379
just you know IP circuits between

445
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:05,659
routers they may be wavelength services

446
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:08,059
for customers you might have legacy TMS

447
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:11,030
or circuits on there or OTN based

448
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:12,230
services there that are non IP so we

449
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,539
have to look in the future at how we

450
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,640
solve solve those problems I'll say in

451
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:18,530
this talk it's a bit more about the high

452
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,839
speed IP networks that may not have

453
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:23,178
those services but we're definitely

454
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,458
looking to find out how we solve those

455
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:27,079
other types of services through through

456
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:32,840
emulation just like we did with

457
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:34,668
low-speed TDM services so this notion of

458
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,559
wavelength utilization and how its

459
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:38,809
improved when I you know basically have

460
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,620
a router at each hop and this is sort of

461
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,600
a pre-canned

462
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,120
example of that you know

463
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,969
I do have a ring of nodes and these

464
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,979
would be routers on this ring where

465
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,380
they're you know equally spaced you know

466
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,970
400 kilometers apart like that it's bit

467
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,009
of a canned example that probably would

468
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:57,169
not happen so much in the real world but

469
00:17:55,009 --> 00:18:00,590
between my a to Z locations you know

470
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:05,509
those are 1,600 kilometers apart and

471
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:07,428
really this gets you know into the when

472
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:10,190
you when you have higher speed bit rates

473
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:12,769
on the optical side there's always a

474
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,330
trade-off with distance and so if I want

475
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:18,649
to carry a wave like the hundred gig

476
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:20,149
wavelength the longer distance if I want

477
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:23,629
to you know use bit rates that are

478
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:26,029
higher like 200 gig 400 800 gig or you

479
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:27,799
know even one terabyte today the

480
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:30,740
distance I can carry that signal you

481
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:32,418
know continues to decrease and this guy

482
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,100
gets to the point that every router hop

483
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:36,649
is really like I know it's an OE yo

484
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,139
conversion it's a region so I don't

485
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:42,320
really run into the the penalties of

486
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:44,539
carrying a signal on long distance so I

487
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,059
have that 400 gig signal that's really

488
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:49,519
regenerated at each hop if I'm using a

489
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,980
direct 200 gig wavelength between those

490
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,629
a 2 Z points I can't really use a

491
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,210
foreigner gig wavelength I have to use a

492
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:58,580
200 gig wavelength so now at each hop

493
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:01,700
I'm sort of unlimited on that piece of

494
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,649
fiber to a 200 gig wavelength which

495
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,570
doesn't make the most maximum

496
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:08,239
utilization out of that single piece of

497
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,649
fiber so really that's kind of how we

498
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,700
unlock you know better wavelength

499
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:15,379
utilization in this hop by hop banner

500
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,700
and you may say you know if I've got to

501
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:18,590
send that signal through every router

502
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,240
that's a really expensive thing to do

503
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:22,129
versus sending it through the road of

504
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,080
network but those are the things that

505
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:27,080
were we're trying to solve in the future

506
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,649
to make that that not the case to make

507
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,899
sending that traffic through the routers

508
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:37,029
you know near the cost or less costly

509
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:37,029
than sending it through a road network

510
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:41,090
so you're sort of you of kind of the

511
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:43,190
innovations that are coming down the

512
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:47,029
pipeline that really enable this type of

513
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:48,919
architecture you know 100 gig 200 gig CF

514
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:51,080
B to D Co has been very popular and

515
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:52,909
access and aggregation networks that are

516
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,080
a bit lower speed and you'll see almost

517
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:56,179
every vendor today

518
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,059
has a device that's some number of

519
00:19:56,179 --> 00:20:01,730
10-gig ports with a few CF p 2 d co

520
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:03,408
ports because like I said for access and

521
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:06,350
aggregation that's become if you want to

522
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:08,960
build a 200 gig access ring it's a very

523
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:11,090
viable technology I'll say for long-term

524
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,130
growth and for higher speed networks

525
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,279
it's not really a solution it's really

526
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,929
the solution in the future is looking at

527
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:21,409
400 gig interfaces it's specifically for

528
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:24,950
gig Zr and something called 400 gig ID

529
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:26,240
what we call open Zr plus and I've got a

530
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,340
few slides where I'll talk about that

531
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,039
specifically the other thing is our

532
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,720
router MP bandwidth capacity and kind of

533
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,139
the continuing growth in what we can

534
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,970
carry on a single device and IP router

535
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:39,799
interface costs other folks that cisco

536
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,480
may not like me to say this but IP

537
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:43,399
interface costs are going to continue to

538
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,100
drop and I'll talk a bit more about this

539
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:47,389
complexity in optics and minimizing

540
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,250
transceiver counts it's a bit of a

541
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:52,600
complex sentence but I'll explain a bit

542
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:56,090
what that means in a later slide

543
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:58,519
excuse me we look at like coherent

544
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,590
optics so 400 gig and 400 Giggsy are

545
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:02,480
those are coherent optics and I'm

546
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,428
there's other talks and where you guys

547
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,340
can can learn about what coherent optics

548
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:09,649
are but what's really unlocking that the

549
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,709
density that we can you know supply in

550
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:14,059
the future using this solution is the

551
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,029
advancements that have allowed us to

552
00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:20,570
package all of that technology into a

553
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:22,100
QFP 56 DD form factor and that's in a

554
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,990
relatively short amount of time the

555
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,279
first couple of you know optics that you

556
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:28,159
see there that's really kind of an

557
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:30,559
integrated on a line card optic you know

558
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,169
and then we quickly move to CFP to ACO

559
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,690
where the DSP was still in a line card

560
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:38,419
and now you know it's very ubiquitous

561
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:41,570
now to find a CP to D Co where we put

562
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:43,429
the coherent DSP on the optic itself and

563
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:47,980
very quickly we're moving to being able

564
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:50,600
to do that at 400 gig in a QFP DD optic

565
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,309
and looking at foreigner gigs this is

566
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,658
Scotty the alphabet super foreigner gig

567
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:55,039
standards the ones that are important

568
00:21:53,659 --> 00:21:58,760
here are really

569
00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:01,299
CR and CR plus 40 gigs er is an O I F

570
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:04,090
which is the optical inner working form

571
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:06,360
it was really an initiative to have a

572
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:10,290
interoperable

573
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:12,290
DWM DWDM based foreigner gig optic from

574
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:16,200
from day one and this is single channel

575
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:17,040
400 gig open zr plot you know open four

576
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,809
gigs er+

577
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,170
and really the real difference between

578
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:23,700
these two is the standard for CR was

579
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:27,299
really to have a 15 watt power

580
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:30,299
dissipation but people saw it like other

581
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:32,220
applications too for these coherent DWDM

582
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,870
optics at four hundred four hundred gig

583
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,210
and routers in the future but they

584
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:39,389
required a dissipation greater than 15

585
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:41,130
watts so zr+ really it relaxes some of

586
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,970
those requirements it allows us to do

587
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:46,559
more with the the optic than zr does i

588
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:48,690
won't go over this too much but zr+

589
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,970
it does allow you to have different

590
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,530
modulation schemes depending on the

591
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,500
distance and reach that you need without

592
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:58,918
optic but the key things this is this is

593
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,900
a tunable DWDM optic and the form factor

594
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,669
that we're looking at you know there

595
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:05,940
will be varieties of this that are CF b

596
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:08,700
to d co bist but really the key one for

597
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:11,610
doing this single layer how by up

598
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:15,270
architecture is the QSF b56 DD because

599
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:18,418
now i can take a line card that's you

600
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:21,150
know built for 24 36 400 gig interfaces

601
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:22,590
and not just use grey interfaces in that

602
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:29,070
i can use each one of those interfaces

603
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:31,168
as a coherent DWDM interface this is an

604
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,960
interesting graph that i I stole from a

605
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:35,850
colleague of mine that it shows the

606
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,820
growth of traffic delivered on the

607
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:41,370
internet over time and gigabits versus

608
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:44,250
the speed of it the capacity of an NP

609
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:46,918
you and as you can see the the router

610
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,809
mpu capacity has lagged behind the

611
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,929
growth of traffic on the internet for

612
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:54,510
for many many years and people have seen

613
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:56,850
that if you buy routers line cards have

614
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:59,790
either lots of em pews or you need lots

615
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:01,230
of devices but now we're finally getting

616
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:03,720
to a point where we have very

617
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:06,059
specialized MP use especially in cases

618
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,820
where I'm handling a lot of aggregation

619
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:10,559
and transit traffic and not a lot of you

620
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:13,110
know queuing not a lot of you know

621
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,460
high-touch services we're building very

622
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:16,469
high capacity and P

623
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,480
that are you know soon gonna eclipse you

624
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:21,180
know 10 terabytes per second in a single

625
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,340
npu I said those are highly specialized

626
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:25,230
in pews for you know mostly transit

627
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,030
traffic but it's one of the things that

628
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:29,010
really allows us to kind of unlock this

629
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:32,010
architecture because it drives down the

630
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:34,379
overall cost of the device because I

631
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:36,720
don't have multiple MP use to cool to

632
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:39,780
power and it just overall lowers what

633
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,820
that individual interface cost is this

634
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,800
kind of this graph gets to sort of what

635
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,889
I was talking about the minimization of

636
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:49,290
transceivers and what it's comparing is

637
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:51,540
the total cost of an interface broken

638
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:54,270
down by what the router host interface

639
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:57,450
cost versus what that optic cost that

640
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:59,310
pluggable optic costs and with 10 gig

641
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,810
most of that cost was still you know

642
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:03,929
kind of buried into the router itself

643
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:06,300
with 100 gig as the complexity in the

644
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:08,970
optic really you know it gets you know

645
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,290
more complicated obviously with 100 gig

646
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,780
we're talking about you know 4

647
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:15,240
wavelengths with most optics that go in

648
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:18,300
routers that optic is more complex so it

649
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,770
raises the price of that versus the cost

650
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,639
of that host interface in the router

651
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:26,040
with 400 gig the router the optic is you

652
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,360
know relatively even more complex and

653
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,210
just do it like what I showed previously

654
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,550
with MPU bandwidth you know that's gonna

655
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:34,860
continue to drive down the cost of you

656
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:37,020
know gigabit per you know dollar per

657
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,610
gigabit or whatever you know metric you

658
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,620
want to use of what that router

659
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:43,679
interface costs per versus what that

660
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:46,439
that optic cost so in a case we are

661
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,790
using a MUX bonder or a transponder you

662
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,220
really want to minimize the number of

663
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,960
optics reusing so if you're using a MUX

664
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,840
ponder that has back-to-back gray

665
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,640
interfaces I have a lot of cost know in

666
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,550
those optics that have to go into each

667
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,170
side of that connection so I really want

668
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:04,110
to minimize the number of those optics

669
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:06,810
that I'm purchasing what this graph

670
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:08,810
doesn't show very well as the kind of

671
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:12,360
price compression of everything overall

672
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:14,639
so if he really had a fair comparison of

673
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:17,790
absolute cost between these pills you

674
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,800
would see them go down a lot and when

675
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:22,170
you look at the comparative price of the

676
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,990
projected comparative price of 400 gig

677
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:27,720
and I get bits per second level versus

678
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:28,260
10 it's a fraction of that and I said

679
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,250
that really

680
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:33,300
unlocks the the cost element of this

681
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,970
versus the way we used to do thing

682
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,830
versus you know building these networks

683
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,570
in the past were very cost prohibitive

684
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,370
and that's what led to these multi-layer

685
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:43,470
architectures but now passing that

686
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:47,030
traffic through a router is not as

687
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:49,950
expensive as as you might think it is

688
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:51,750
and I'll try to quickly go through kind

689
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:53,760
of a modeling example that we've done

690
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:56,190
and and with this type of architecture

691
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,790
we've done modeling to date I think for

692
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:01,830
over 20 networks both already deployed

693
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:04,290
networks like I said this is sort of a

694
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:06,510
can sample Network and the span of this

695
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:08,850
network is around 100 kilometers which

696
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:12,120
is maybe a typical in the u.s. regional

697
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:14,149
or metro network and this is a what we

698
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,919
call more of a subscriber heavy network

699
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,480
so there's really four traffic sources

700
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,220
and then every other side of the network

701
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,810
is like a traffic sync a lot of

702
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,120
north-south traffic so like I said

703
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:27,090
triple typical kind of service provider

704
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,489
network these days and then we we do it

705
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:31,500
to a traffic model and really the

706
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,540
traffic model is just north-south

707
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,910
traffic that's traffic from these

708
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:38,580
caching sites and Gateway sites down to

709
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:42,030
subscriber sites so there's really no

710
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:44,370
traffic that goes in between the edge

711
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,660
sites on this network why so this is

712
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,090
typical of what we've seen a lot of

713
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:50,970
either residential or mobile subscriber

714
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:54,659
networks these days so we look at this

715
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:56,670
you know hop by hop approach and we are

716
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,520
building you know basically packet rings

717
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:02,280
it in this approach and you can see this

718
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,350
is a very high capacity network so you

719
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,290
know and this is all built with 400 gig

720
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:10,649
interfaces so in this use case we use

721
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:12,690
over 1300 you know 400 gig interfaces to

722
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:16,290
do this some of the lag sizes are very

723
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:18,770
large but this uses you know no photonic

724
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:21,720
elements other than multiplexers and

725
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:23,520
amplifiers so there's no box ponders no

726
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,430
transponders there's no rotom's in this

727
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,020
network at all we look at the

728
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:30,390
hollow-core approach which is kind of a

729
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,920
worst case scenario for optical things

730
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,900
like wavelength utilization this is

731
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:36,000
building a still having that full

732
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:38,190
photonic optical transport network and

733
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,660
building you know circuits from each

734
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,700
source site to each edge

735
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,070
site and I would say you know very few

736
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,930
networks are built this way today but

737
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,820
the likes of this holler core approach

738
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:50,280
we just do it for comparison reasons

739
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:54,929
between these different different

740
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:56,760
potential options and then we look at

741
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:58,320
optimized bypass and that's really the

742
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,240
way a lot of networks are deployed today

743
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,030
they have a full Rotem network

744
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,010
underneath they look at you know they do

745
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,720
there's modeling that's done to figure

746
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:09,720
out you know how to interconnect things

747
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,960
logically via optical circuits that you

748
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,970
know really lead to the lowest cost you

749
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,100
know of carrying that traffic from the

750
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:19,020
source of the destination and like I

751
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,060
said to date this has really been the

752
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,460
cost efficient way to deploy networks

753
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,110
and really why these multi-layer

754
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,900
networks - we're at a point to begin

755
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:29,699
with and it uses less interfaces than

756
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,640
they have be other options but you still

757
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,500
have that Rotem layer underneath here's

758
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,090
a way we kind of you know compare these

759
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,640
different options and this is a load of

760
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:40,290
50 terabytes per second which is a

761
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,150
pretty high capacity network there's

762
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:45,420
very few networks today that have 50

763
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:47,460
terabytes per second of bandwidth and

764
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,710
obviously you know the number of router

765
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,590
interfaces used is much higher on the

766
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:54,540
but on the hop-by-hop network and that's

767
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,250
to be expected because now I'm passing

768
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:59,909
all these trap all this traffic through

769
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:01,230
each router verses the bypass the big

770
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,880
thing to keep in mind though is this

771
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:05,160
there is no road of network so there's

772
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,030
no Rotom Network to manage there's no

773
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,230
transponders or MUX Ponder's it doesn't

774
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:12,780
mean that you couldn't use you could use

775
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:15,170
the bypass network without MUX pounders

776
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,610
and transponders and just simply rotom's

777
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:19,110
but that Rotom cost is still there you

778
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,870
still have to manage that layer of the

779
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:24,870
network and this does not have sort of

780
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:26,459
the absolute cost comparison we can

781
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,840
absolutely do that for certain networks

782
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,210
because we don't really want to talk

783
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,010
about absolute cost now you'll find that

784
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,440
the absolute cost of carrying this in

785
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:37,410
the future even with 1300 router

786
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,600
interfaces is very comparable to this

787
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:42,360
solution that's a bypass based and

788
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,080
definitely less costly than the hollow

789
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,080
core model

790
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,200
this is a bit too complex to go over in

791
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,480
zero seconds

792
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,010
so if guests have questions about this

793
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,440
in the future you could take a look and

794
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:58,299
feel free to email me but I've learned

795
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,929
need questions cuz I think I am just

796
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:00,929
about out of time

797
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:16,929
all right be quick here Dave Swanson

798
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:19,269
from Siena at Nana on 54 in San Diego

799
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:21,309
one of your colleagues Lawrence actually

800
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:22,779
gave probably the best presentation I

801
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:24,609
ever saw at Nanak he was actually

802
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:26,190
talking about power consumption in

803
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:29,109
high-end routers

804
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:30,879
he made a lot of the same points you

805
00:31:29,109 --> 00:31:33,218
made with density basically being the

806
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:37,658
one thing that sells boxes or everything

807
00:31:33,219 --> 00:31:38,769
else of course do WDM systems exist

808
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:41,259
because they're cheaper

809
00:31:38,769 --> 00:31:44,829
is it the contention here you think

810
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:46,389
that's gonna flip yes okay and a lot of

811
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:48,219
that comes from the complexity and

812
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:50,708
former gig optics and it's probably LJ

813
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:55,450
LJ is of great speed yeah yeah exactly

814
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:59,609
okay thank you Steve our core is no

815
00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:02,859
networks just kind of curious the

816
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:04,629
density alignment with optics and router

817
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:08,739
interfaces is great I was just curious

818
00:32:04,629 --> 00:32:10,718
as to how you saw transport services

819
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:13,029
which are being delivered over the

820
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:15,940
existing Rotem infrastructure kind of

821
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:18,309
evolving and you have service providers

822
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:20,829
who have to deliver both the you know

823
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:23,379
packet service and transport service

824
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:24,820
kind of sweating those assets or you

825
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:27,248
know how that transition is gonna take

826
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,869
place yeah it's hard nobody can really

827
00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:31,929
build a Greenfield Network today it's

828
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:33,789
very hard and it's not that the solution

829
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:35,739
I showed couldn't run you you could have

830
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:37,929
transport obviously you can transport

831
00:32:35,739 --> 00:32:40,329
those foreigner gig wavelengths over as

832
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:42,359
alien waves over an existing system we

833
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:45,399
see that as kind of the migration path

834
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:47,439
for things like 10 gig or even 100 gig

835
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:50,079
services we are looking at you know bit

836
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,200
transparent emulation for those services

837
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,609
so we realized you know we have to find

838
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,019
a way to deal with those those

839
00:32:54,609 --> 00:33:00,009
traditional transport services long term

840
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:02,940
yeah it's definitely something we're

841
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:08,320
looking at but not fully solved today

842
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:10,979
good Brad Tonto Rackspace maybe you

843
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,559
could help me get past this block but

844
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:16,659
merging these two these two networks is

845
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,729
a problem with me because my routers

846
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:20,049
need to be upgraded on a regular basis

847
00:33:18,729 --> 00:33:21,900
they need to be rebooted on a regular

848
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:24,540
basis but my transport nodes are

849
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,580
pretty much stable and they're up for a

850
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:28,620
long time so I see that big map and I

851
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:33,240
see a router it needs to be taken down

852
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:34,709
for maintenance now I've lost 50 25 50

853
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,290
percent of my capacity for their entire

854
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:39,810
metro region just to take a single

855
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:41,340
router out of service is that just a

856
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:45,000
mental thing I need to get past is

857
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:47,010
theirs is there a counter to that well I

858
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,450
would say that you know I came from a

859
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:50,400
service provider it was a very

860
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:52,530
residential service provider but by far

861
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:56,010
the number one failure we had in our

862
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:59,010
networks was fiber outages router

863
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,990
outages were very infrequent obviously

864
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:02,670
maintenance is a whole nother you know

865
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:04,650
planned maintenance and that's

866
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,720
absolutely true if I have that much

867
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:09,480
capacity through a device and transport

868
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,940
elements aren't upgraded nearly as often

869
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,550
as router elements but that wasn't the

870
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,110
main failure mode that we saw pretty

871
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:18,600
often and obviously Rackspace you might

872
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:20,730
be in more of a metro DCI news case

873
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,899
where that doesn't happen as often but

874
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:24,840
yeah it's definitely definitely a

875
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:31,380
concern on how you you know managing

876
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:36,540
that that capacity in the future who do

877
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:39,480
folks really comb I somewhat tend to

878
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:42,418
interpret this comment like well okay

879
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:46,350
you probably have to throw into the

880
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:50,219
overall calculation the need for more

881
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:52,918
spare capacity to deal with events like

882
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:55,589
the question yeah it really comes down

883
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:57,750
to how you've been handling protection

884
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:59,250
in the past and how much capacity you

885
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,360
have for whatever traffic's on your

886
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,030
network if you want a hundred percent

887
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,800
failover capacity at like layer three

888
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:07,920
then you may have already been doing

889
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,620
that I said optical restoration is not

890
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,140
wide not really you know widespread in

891
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:15,270
widespread use that that was a method to

892
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:17,250
maybe do cheaper than layer three

893
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:18,690
protection but it's all part of the

894
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,060
capacity planning and looking at your

895
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:23,220
traffic flows and if I've got lots of

896
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,080
best-effort traffic and someone loses

897
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,629
their cat videos for a minute maybe

898
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:30,690
that's okay but critical traffic that's

899
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:32,700
a whole different story all right well

900
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,120
having exhausted my time so thank you

901
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:41,350
everybody

902
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:41,350
[Applause]

903
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,620
you
