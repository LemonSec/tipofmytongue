not disclose geographical location who

a teen for now some of this information

you obviously can derive from directory

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,169
can be determined so a little bit on

38
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,780
history and evolution like most

00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything else for the with the</font>

00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:12,430
but let's go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to history and</font>

49
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:14,260
evolution RFC 791 1981 said if you want

50
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,050
an IP address send an email to john

51
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:19,060
he'll give it to you that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly how</font>

52

it started how it worked this<font color="#E5E5E5"> myth about</font>

55
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,549
way it started<font color="#E5E5E5"> course very soon John</font>

56
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">realized that he had other things to do</font>

57
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:33,720
besides manage handing out IP addresses

58
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:37,510
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we had the beginning of the</font>

59
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:41,470
system of IP address management now

60
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:44,500
beginning in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the early 80s the central</font>

61
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:47,130

62
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:51,400
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> sr i-- and eventually moved to</font>

63
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:54,970
network solutions and it existed all the

64
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,730
way up to nineteen ninety-seven the

65
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:00,700
first regional registry was formed in

66
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:04,600
1992 is ripe<font color="#E5E5E5"> ncc followed shortly</font>

67
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,579
thereafter by the AP Nick Aaron was the

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,329
last major or bigoted registry of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">original set to be formed in 1997 in</font>

black<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick evolved as the fourth the</font>

out of Aaron<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fifth reginal registry</font>

75

which we expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to become operational</font>

76
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,010
next year 2005 a zapper<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick and is</font>

77
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:42,010
actually now currently being

administered by ripe<font color="#CCCCCC"> NCC ap Nick and</font>

79
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:48,370
Aaron one other organization from the IR

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,500
perspective that's important is that

81
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,740
over the years the IRS have found it

82
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,880
necessary to work together<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do things</font>

83
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:59,530
many things and also have found it

84
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:02,829
difficult at times for people to go

85
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:04,630
straight to the IRS with with something

86
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,190
for example the IETF wants to do

87
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and so once it give it to the</font>

88
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,720
address registries a dude it didn't have

89
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,240
anyone to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to I mean they can go to</font>

90
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,650
ripe<font color="#E5E5E5"> NCC the ripe NCC shares it but the</font>

91
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,300
delegation of and directions you see

92
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,350
that goes down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Erin same thing blah</font>

93
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:22,060
blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah so what we did is that we</font>

94
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,440
formed this organization to take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

95
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">these kinds of things and I'll go into</font>

96
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">more about the in our own later and then</font>

97
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:31,360
lastly that red bar on top indicates the

98
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,770
beginning of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the desire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a part of the</font>

100
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:40,539
of the internet management business and

101
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,370
so I can was formed in 1999 I can is

102
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,740
still operating under a memorandum of

103
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:49,350
understanding with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US government</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

104
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:52,390
that expires I believe some time in 2005

105
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:55,000
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the service regions</font>

106
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,979
before that existed today our errand

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:49,149
doing what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it look like it's</font>

148
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:51,309
basically got two sub organizations one

149
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:53,229
is a set of supporting organizations of

150
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:55,569
which there are three the address

151
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:57,909
supporting organization the country code

152
00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:00,339
name supporting organization and a

153
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:02,998
generic top-level domain name supporting

154
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:06,039
organization then there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> series of</font>

155
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:07,930
committees and task forces and there are

156
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,789
actually a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> committees than what</font>

157
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,009
I show here these are the ones that are

158
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:14,649
advisory committees to the board of

159
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:16,569

160
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:18,519
the at-large committee the government

164
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:29,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">the technical liaison group which is</font>

165
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,580
really how the IETF interfaces with the

ICANN board and the address<font color="#E5E5E5"> supporting</font>

167
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,930

168
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than an advisory body for global</font>

169
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,430
addressing policy I will say this

170
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:45,990
there's very very little policy would be

171
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:48,309
global addressing policy I was math

172
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:50,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">ninety-nine point nine nine percent</font>

173
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:52,599
somewhere there at the Senate<font color="#E5E5E5"> II of all</font>

174
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:55,569
addressing policy is actually regional

175
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:57,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">in nature and now it's coincidental that</font>

176
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:59,080
allow these policies are very similar

177
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,240
and that through various regional

178
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,099
registries have the same policies but

179
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">they don't</font>

180
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:07,950
the same flavor of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy everyone</font>

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,540
we wanted to hormone eyes our

cooperative efforts and we put the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NRO</font>

together to do three<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we want to</font>

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:32,490
doing the INF function that is a single

point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of failure and there certainly</font>

214
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,110
needs to be some mechanism in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> event</font>

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,610
that I can't go no longer perform that

00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,380
function I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily talking</font>

217
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,940
about i can going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of business but it</font>

218
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,020
is in Marina del Rey and they do tend to

219
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">have earthquakes and things like that</font>

220
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:49,230
there's well we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> promote and</font>

221
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,530
protect the bottom of policy development

222
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,960
process what we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want is a body to</font>

223
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:57,390
sit there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and dictate to you the users</font>

224
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,710
what is the policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for how you're going</font>

225
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,180
to get IP addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're</font>

226
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,800
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with them it's very</font>

227
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,329
important that this be an open and

228
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,829
democratic process the way it has

229
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,170
existed for years and you

230
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,060
and years so as another reason why we

231
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,670
formed in our oath protect that process

232
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,489
and lastly I kind of alluded to already

233
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,290
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the NRO as axes that focal</font>

234
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,540
point for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet community to input</font>

235
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:20,339
into the IR system so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

236
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:24,240
three things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we formed the NRL to</font>

237
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:31,400
do so what's it look like well you can

238
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:34,350
see the the registries at the bottom

we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting ready to in fact it's</font>

263
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:44,310
something else that I guess it must be

<font color="#E5E5E5">something in the air about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an errand</font>

00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:04,949
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NRO will operate and act as the</font>

change so the two are elected at-large

281
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:34,380

members is met we decided would be

289
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:55,230
better suited that if one of those

290
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,560
people really was there and knew what

291
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:00,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">was going on we have been blessed so far</font>

292
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,388
that the generally the people that are

have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> elected for the address</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">council have an idea what address space</font>

295
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,250
management's about but there's no

296
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:12,630
guarantee that that would happen

297
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,860
future so what's the interval looked

298
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,120
like it's got the Executive<font color="#CCCCCC"> Council</font>

the executive councils has appointed

307
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,949
described a little bit about what the

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:46,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> where there's actually a rotation</font>

AP Nick the<font color="#E5E5E5"> secretary is from ripe NCC</font>

315
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,270
ripe NCC staff the treasurer is from

lack Nick and Aaron this year does not

317
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,199
have an officer position and so we

318
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,660
contribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> goodwill and a lot of writing</font>

319
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,660
efforts now because two groups are

320
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,370
composed of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people from the various</font>

321
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,140

322
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,630
engineering coordination group is

323
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,880
chaired by the chief technical officer

324
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:23,790
from the ripe NCC since that's where the

325

appointed senior engineers to this group

327
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:32,100
this allows the IRS<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the group to</font>

328
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,470
coordinate and do joint activities I'll

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,960
similarly the coordination group is

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,260
chaired by the senior communications

00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:16,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's got everything it's a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if you haven't been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Derek you</font>

392
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,310
should go there because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a lot</font>

393
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:23,899
of background information a lot of

394
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:26,560
documentation and the copies of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mou</font>

395
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,800
that formed the in a row plus the

00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:33,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">document that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to form the ASO</font>

397
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,850
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk a little bit now</font>

398
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,560
about the world summit on the

399
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:40,480
information society and since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I finished</font>

400
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:43,370
this I am done with high-level politics

401
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">government's for a several period of</font>

402
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,419
time have been involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in trying to</font>

403
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,850
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do about the internet</font>

404
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,410
and as the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> government tries to get</font>

405
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:56,300
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it there are other governments</font>

406
00:17:51,410 --> 00:18:01,700
are trying to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so out of</font>

407
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:03,110
this concern arose a idea that there

408
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:08,180
should be a world summit on the

409
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:10,310
information society and as a result of

410
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:12,920
that through the years 2002 and

411
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:15,350
culminating in december 2003 in geneva

412
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,330
at the site at the first summit meeting

413
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:19,520
two documents were produced a

414
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:21,770
declaration<font color="#CCCCCC"> of principles and a plan of</font>

415
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,980
action and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Declaration of Principles</font>

416
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:27,340
is just that it

417
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:30,160
is a actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty long document that</font>

418
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,199
describes the principles by which the

419
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,290
summit believes the internet should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

420
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,540
operated in governor and the plan of

421
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:40,149
action is the needs of their proposing

422
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:41,440
on how to get there<font color="#E5E5E5"> now nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

423
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,140
really happened with you these two

424
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,110
documents because we're actually now

425
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:49,240
going into a phase<font color="#CCCCCC"> two now the ITU is</font>

426
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,889
the one that basically sponsored the

00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:05,969
governance so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your acronym bag you</font>

432
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:09,309
now have whistles and wigging and the

433
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:11,980
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group recently about three weeks</font>

434
00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:14,410
ago they conducted a consultation in

435
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,150
Geneva to figure out what it's going to

436
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:18,190
do and to figure out who gets to be in

437
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,070
the working group now I attended that

438
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:22,299
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guarantee you it's a lot of</font>

439
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,090
governments wanting to do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

440
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:27,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and everyone has all the little</font>

441
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:30,250
things that they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see done so</font>

442
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:32,650
it's it's it's a lot of complicated

443
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,940
things going on so that layer 9 is

444
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:38,440
really getting worked over real hard

445
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:42,040
here and the outcome is as expected in

446
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:46,390
2005 to have another summit in Tunis at

447
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:49,389
the end of 2005 and so between now and

448
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,919
then there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be several prep comms</font>

449
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:53,410
that actually the first one was<font color="#E5E5E5"> held</font>

450
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:57,250
earlier this year this next one is going

451
00:19:53,410 --> 00:20:01,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be in February and the last one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

452
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:04,760
scheduled to be in July and where we go

453
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:07,640
from there it's anybody's guess

454
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,740
so what's the plan I'm not going to go

455
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,720
through this when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the web</font>

when i get to think of vertigo PDF file

00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,610
finally you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to see this up on</font>

can do which is probably more important

510
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:32,169
from some perspectives is that you can

511
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,820
nominate and vote for members<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

Aaron meeting Susan Hamlin the director

525
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:07,210
harping on a little bit here its

526
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:10,270
industry regulated and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's regulated</font>

527
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:14,260
from this perspective that the Executive

528
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:16,000
Board of any<font color="#CCCCCC"> ir is elected and its</font>

529
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,500
industry regulated in that members

530
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
approve activities now what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

531
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,810
mean you sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and vote on every</font>

532
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,880
time that I tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Leslie to go do</font>

533
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:26,230
something I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

534
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,520
really means is that you're the ones

535
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:32,560
that create the policy I don't make

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,600
the problem is we don't make policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

541
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:47,470
only executed we do what you tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font>

or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we should engage in some type of</font>

an<font color="#E5E5E5"> activity for example</font>

552
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:13,570
list and also in a public policy meaning

553
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:17,470
I can't remember when it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was</font>

554
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:18,760
Phil but in the end the people in the

other registries as well but that's how

training so those are organizational

590
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,910
activities that take place now I said we

591
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,290
don't make policy but you couldn't make

592

policy if you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the tools to</font>

I Arab reforms are those that will help

595
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,590
you make policy so maintaining the

596
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:59,950
discussion lists the email list

597
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:01,379
archiving those things conducting the

598
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,820
policy meetings in other words

599
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:07,010
going out and engaging a venue and

600
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:11,580

612
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,570
published the policy documents these

613
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:39,090
include two forms of documents one is

614
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:41,040
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual policy itself and the second</font>

615
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:43,770
is a procedural document that says

616
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,080
here's how the policy is implemented now

617
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,879
in some cases it's an actual procedural

618
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,800
guide in other cases is probably just

619
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:54,330
detailed instructions on a template and

620
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:57,600
here is the house of IP address

will be treated exactly the same way

689
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,210
using the same procedures because those

690
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,850
procedures are documented and you have

691
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:04,130
the opportunity look Adam see what it is

697
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:20,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">think Aaron</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should do this and then a</font>

698
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:23,149
discussion would start so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

699
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:25,040
cycle to this cell<font color="#CCCCCC"> and first one is what</font>

need has to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> identified now there's</font>

702
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,290
several different ways and needs get to

703
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:32,720
be identified<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is by a change of</font>

executive boards of the various I ours

711

are the final arbiters on whether or not

712
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:59,870
consensus was reached and then it's

713
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,690
implemented and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's implemented not</font>

only by the registry staff but also by

753
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:55,619
one is is that that central registry

754
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:58,799
space represents a lot of legacy class a

755

763
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:22,289
represents is is it's interesting that

764
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:26,129
out is that the conservation principle

765

769
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:38,849
significant is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that most if not all</font>

770
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:40,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that occurred during</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dot-com boom</font>

while the numbers may vary from region

to region if you look the curves

basically follow the same shape<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

look at it by economies or countries the

846
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:27,400
US has 94 allocations of x 36 base so

if you can demonstrate an immediate need

00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,009
you don't have to do a lot of other

953
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:08,600
it is a plan and you got a plan to

954
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:12,020
provide ipv6 connectivity that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

970
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:58,430
legally look at what occurs is that the

IP address space goes from sa company a

972
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:05,210
buys<font color="#E5E5E5"> Company B well what happens is that</font>

company a says<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay company b i just</font>

and so forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this equipment right</font>

977
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:19,509
now it's got IP addresses on it and

978
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:24,799
sorry those IP addresses don't go with

979
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:27,890
the machines they go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 22</font>

00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:31,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron but what you really do is you said</font>

981
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:33,230
hey dear aaron i would like to use these

982
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,730
same addresses if i could so there's a

983
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:36,170
transfer policy that takes into account

984
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:38,300
this is how this is going to happen

985
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:40,370
because what you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is you come</font>

00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:47,170
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my justification to address space</font>

so please issue me this address base and

990
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:52,010
because if you knew said well let's make

Company B to Erin back to company yet so

999
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:12,288
although the term transfer is used it's

1000
00:44:09,529 --> 00:44:14,719
actually a return in a justification for

1001
00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:17,210
new space and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to</font>

1005
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:26,690
hard process some additional services

that provided some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1007
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:32,630
repetitive from what I start

1008
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:34,729
literally with IRS general do we also in

1009
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:37,640
there will be a gun to a little bit

1010
00:44:34,729 --> 00:44:40,180
they've tutorial later on this week

1011

<font color="#E5E5E5">about the cryptographic authentication</font>

1012
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:46,399
we've got documentation on our website

1015
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:59,539
480 you can get bulk copies of Aaron who

1016
00:44:56,029 --> 00:45:03,950
is by filling out an AUP and you get

before crisp gets out the door to put up

1036
00:45:55,069 --> 00:45:58,720
the central registry went away well the

00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:02,230
central registry allocator

1038
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:06,160
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of space and a lot of that space</font>

1039
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:09,520
was also in the ripe<font color="#CCCCCC"> NCC region and the</font>

1040
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,170
AP Nick region well the people in those

00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:20,140
change even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though the registration</font>

1044

record was in another registry so it was

1045
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:24,759
kind of cumbersome so beginning about

1046
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:27,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">four years ago and said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well let's</font>

1047
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:30,910
change that let's make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP</font>

1048
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:32,920
only has to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one place and so we</font>

1049
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:36,819
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving these things records</font>

1050
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:39,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">around 1 / 8 at a time and we heard just</font>

1051
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:42,400
about done we are now<font color="#CCCCCC"> into doing this</font>

1052
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:44,530
with the records in a swamp so it's been

1053
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,180
a long and painful process<font color="#E5E5E5"> because a lot</font>

1054
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:48,609
of notifications that we've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> occur</font>

1055
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:52,000
and so forth but for almost finished so

1056
00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:53,710
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is probably one thing that</font>

1057
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,359
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could always point to and say this</font>

1058
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,490
is how well the IRS can work together

1059
00:46:55,359 --> 00:47:05,710
for the good of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet it's just</font>

1060
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:07,450
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> right there cross registry it</font>

1061
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:10,839
was an<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet or information service</font>

1063
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:14,529
of like who is but it's not a

1064
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:17,410
replacement for who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a directory</font>

1065
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:19,420
service there are several<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet wraps</font>

1066
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:22,720
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> available</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF</font>

1067
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:24,640
site look at that working group it

1068
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:29,379
primarily started out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the names world</font>

1069
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:32,140
and from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the addressing perspective we</font>

1070
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,609
were asked would we participate and we

1071
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,779
thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and said well do we</font>

1072
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:36,369
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get involved with the</font>

1073
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,510
names people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we said well no we</font>

1074
00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:39,130
don't want get involved with the names

1075
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:42,369
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we do think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

1076
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:43,450
participate because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

1077
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:45,130
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that something doesn't get</font>

1078
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:47,140
implemented that could have an impact on

1079
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:49,540
us so there are separate drafts or

1080
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:52,359
portions of drafts<font color="#E5E5E5"> that deal with it</font>

1081
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:56,980
strictly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the directory service aspect</font>

1082
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:58,710
from an address in perspective policy

1083
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:00,760
development a little bit more on this

1084
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:01,960
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do the same way everybody</font>

1085
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,080
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it open</font>

1086
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,300
forms and if you're one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the believe</font>

1087
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,589
140 people this register for vote for

1088
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:10,540
both meetings and this is your first

1089
00:48:08,589 --> 00:48:11,799
time to an area meeting welcome I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

forward to your participation our policy

<font color="#CCCCCC">of element is it's responsive what you</font>

1093
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:21,399

1094
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:25,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've got to be careful what you wish</font>

1095
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,500
for technical challenges in policy

1096
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,660
development is always a technical

1097
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,760
challenge that is there's could easily

1098
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:32,830
be through three competing technologies

1099
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:35,230
about how to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and so that</font>

1100
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:37,869
argument will ensue inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room now</font>

1101
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:40,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">erin has a very well documented internet</font>

1102
00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:44,530
resource policy evaluation process it's

1103
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:46,960
at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> URL right there and in fact I</font>

1104
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:49,810
believe we have copies available in our

<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting hand out packets as well so if</font>

1109
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,790
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that a policy has been moved</font>

00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:07,618
through the process without<font color="#E5E5E5"> following</font>

1111
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:10,960
was documented in this process I you

00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:13,510
must<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll say muster you to contact me</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened here and give you an</font>

1117
00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:25,779
answer is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important to us that</font>

1118
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:27,819
we follow this process so some

1119
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:30,400
milestones going back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> those little</font>

1120
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:33,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">things we talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before need okay</font>

1121
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,050
in the urine policy process you got to

1122
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:39,430
submit at least 60 days prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an open</font>

1123
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:41,320
policy meeting and the Advisory Council

00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:44,379
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> erin goes through and does an initial</font>

1125
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:48,310
review and begins the discussion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1126
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:50,560
and there's then a formal proposal

00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:53,890
posting 30 days prior<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the public</font>

00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:59,290
initial review come back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say she is</font>

1131
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,970
already a policy that covers this

00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:04,119
proposal will say this shouldn't go

1133
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:06,310
forward will say so or he'll say that

1134
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:08,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually there's already a policy that</font>

1135
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:11,020
deals with this but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a change to</font>

1136
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:13,359
it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the author might want to</font>

1137
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,930
consider changing the current policy or

1138
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,308
getting rid of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> April</font>

1139
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:17,868
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> one so there may be some other</font>

1140
00:50:16,309 --> 00:50:20,150
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have to be done the language</font>

1141
00:50:17,869 --> 00:50:23,990
may not be clear or maybe some

1142
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:26,240
convoluted logic there but so the AC may

1143
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:29,479
decide while we need to work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1144
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:31,759
author of the policy according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font>

1145
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:34,190
hey let it go and see what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1146
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway 30 days prior to the meeting is</font>

1147
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:38,599
the formal proposal posting and numbers

1148
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:41,900
given to the policy proposal and so

1149
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:43,400
forth then at the open policy meeting

1150
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,839
there's a discussion now up to this

1151
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,819
point there's been discussion on the

1152
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:48,680
mail list and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

1153
00:50:46,819 --> 00:50:50,058
face-to-face discussion in the policy

1154
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,000
meeting and it'll be Thursday or

1155
00:50:50,059 --> 00:50:56,059
Wednesday Thursday of this week then

1156
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:59,599
based upon the discussions on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the email</font>

1157
00:50:56,059 --> 00:51:01,910
list and on and what occurred<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

1158
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,980
open policy meeting the air and AC will

1159
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:05,540
meet this week in fact Thursday night

1160
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,040
after the conclusion of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-day</font>

1161
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:09,650
public policy meeting and do an

1162
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:15,829
appraisal about what they think there's

1163
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:18,140
consensus reached and to assist in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1164
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:22,670
in fact it happens at the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy</font>

1165
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:25,040
meeting Aaron staff provides a summary

1166
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:26,450
of the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the email list</font>

1167
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,069
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> words how many posts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made the</font>

1168
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:30,439
list by how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and what were</font>

1169
00:51:28,069 --> 00:51:32,270
the general threads so it takes a little

1170
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,790
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier for you to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at it</font>

1171
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:36,349
yourself and see what's happened that's

1172
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:39,369
presented at the public policy meeting

1173
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:43,299
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also provided on a routine basis</font>

1174
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:46,910
over time to the Aaron visor<font color="#E5E5E5"> e Council</font>

1175
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:48,619
so anyway they appraise it and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1176
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:50,598
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's consensus that this</font>

1177
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:52,480
thing should move forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Asia or</font>

1178
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:55,670
last call for an additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 days</font>

1179
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:57,799
working days<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last chance for</font>

1180
00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:02,630
people to say things much similar way an

1181
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:04,819
ITF last call works and then they can

1182
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:07,819
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting is generally a telephonic</font>

1183
00:52:04,819 --> 00:52:11,960
meaning to review the results of the

1184
00:52:07,819 --> 00:52:13,369
last call and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> to after all this they</font>

1185
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,530
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's consensus that this</font>

1186
00:52:13,369 --> 00:52:17,829
should move forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> they sent it to the</font>

1187
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:20,390
Aaron board of trustees<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ratification</font>

1188
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:23,579
now the board is not ratifying the

1189
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:25,890
policy the board is looking at

1190
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:28,859
be sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the process was followed</font>

1191
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:31,440
and that the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we're looking</font>

1192
00:52:28,859 --> 00:52:33,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">at is to make sure that there's nothing</font>

1193
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">there that's going to be damaging to the</font>

1194
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:37,920
members in other words we don't want a

1195
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:41,130
policy that's going to cause Aaron to

1196
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,869
get sued and<font color="#CCCCCC"> therefore there's where all</font>

1197
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:45,150
your membership fees went and went to

1198
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:47,999
the pockets of the air and<font color="#E5E5E5"> general</font>

1199
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:51,509
counsel now let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's they have a</font>

1200
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:54,598
fiduciary responsibility and also they

1201
00:52:51,509 --> 00:52:58,229
are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look to determine and see</font>

1202
00:52:54,599 --> 00:53:00,180
to make sure that everybody was that

1203
00:52:58,229 --> 00:53:02,249
they could think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of or should have been</font>

1204
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:07,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">consulted on this process it was</font>

1205
00:53:02,249 --> 00:53:09,930
consulted and it follows things passed

1206
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:11,788
muster then and say here it is the Aaron

1207
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:16,109
staff gets it in the errands deficit in

1208
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:19,109
the process again that's the URL<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

1209
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:22,558
policy process and I can set it will be

1210
00:53:19,109 --> 00:53:24,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">available to hand out later this week so</font>

1211
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,309
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't read this go ahead and</font>

1212
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:28,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">read it and for those who don't like</font>

1213
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:30,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">flowcharts there is a real nice</font>

1214
00:53:28,759 --> 00:53:33,449
complicated flow chart to go with this

1215
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:36,598
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hours going through it</font>

1216
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:38,339
making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are no loops that</font>

1217
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:40,680
Phil you that you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> escape from and</font>

1218
00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:45,509
so forth so it's a fun game in the bar

1219
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:48,868
after about five years so now we've

1220
00:53:45,509 --> 00:53:52,709
added a few things to this first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all</font>

1221
00:53:48,869 --> 00:53:55,440
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said way back that the ACC's</font>

1222
00:53:52,709 --> 00:53:56,910
going to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> things well if the AC</font>

1223
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,130
said now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like this thing</font>

1224
00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:00,989
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it already exists and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so why</font>

1225
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:04,709
should it become and discussed again to

1226
00:54:00,989 --> 00:54:05,999
policy or exists or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it said well we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1227
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:07,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">really want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work with the author and</font>

1228
00:54:05,999 --> 00:54:09,899
it's the author<font color="#CCCCCC"> says well screw you i'm</font>

1229
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:11,369
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work with you so the AC</font>

1230
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:15,900
doesn't recommend that it goes forward

1231
00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:18,690
so the author can petition and all the

1232
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:20,219
author has to do is find for people for

1233
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:23,160
organ from four different organizations

1234
00:54:20,219 --> 00:54:25,079
and it says yes we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this policy</font>

1235
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:27,239
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be discussed and there's a</font>

1236
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:28,619
process to do that and it goes out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font>

1237
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">public last call for people to</font>

1238
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:31,540
participate

1239
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:33,880
and the petition period is open for a

1240
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:35,380
period of time and if four people say

1241
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:39,250
yes then it goes forward and gets

1242
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:42,550
discussed now after the last call when

1243
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:44,619
the AC does our appraisal and say well

1244
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:49,300
we really don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the same met</font>

1245
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:50,859
the last call review or we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really</font>

1246
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:53,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">think there was consensus reached to the</font>

1247
00:54:50,859 --> 00:54:55,869
meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the mail list the author of</font>

1248
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:57,549
the policy could say well I really

1249
00:54:55,869 --> 00:55:01,060
disagree with you and they can petition

1250
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:02,619
again now the hurdle is a little higher

1251
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:04,330
here now you've got to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten people</font>

1252
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:05,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different organizations agree</font>

1253
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:08,799
with you to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing back into</font>

1254
00:55:05,589 --> 00:55:10,599
discussion so if you can successful

1255
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:13,630
petition the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> that policy stays</font>

1256
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:16,180
there so but that does it says that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1257
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:17,830
AC can't be arbitrary and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say well I</font>

1258
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:19,660
don't like John because he's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1259
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:25,619
since I don't like John I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like its</font>

1260
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:31,299
policy proposal and so there has been

1261
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:33,970
fine or how many petitions one to one of

1262
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:36,690
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> each of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them and I can't recall</font>

1263
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:36,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">the outcomes</font>

1264
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:44,560
okay one succeeded and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last call</font>

1265
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:47,210
when did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it works both ways</font>

1266
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:50,120
now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Board of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Trustees has got a</font>

1267
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:52,370
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that can do one is let's</font>

1268
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:54,080
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> something happens well the</font>

1269
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:56,240
Board of Trustees<font color="#CCCCCC"> can suspend this</font>

1270
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:58,520
process is a short process that can be

1271
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,899
used in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Board of Trustees says</font>

1272
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,300
there's an emergency we have to have a

1273
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:04,970
policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with something right now</font>

1274
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:07,640
so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a provision to get this</font>

1275
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:10,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done in a period done in a shorter</font>

1276
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:12,140
period of time also remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said that</font>

1277
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:13,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aea that the board is kind of</font>

1278
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:15,200
concerned about making sure everyone's

1279
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:18,440
voice was heard well they have the

1280
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:21,470
capability also suspending a policy good

1281
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:25,250
example is the virtual web hosting

1282
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:29,470
policy of their 2000 somewhere in 2,000

1283
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:32,780
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah was Tuesday was 2000 2001 and</font>

1284
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:35,870
a policy was passed in 2000 which

1285
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:39,020
basically dealt with virtual web hosting

1286
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:40,190
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were bunch of guys it didn't</font>

1287
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,560
participate in this discussion because

1288
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:44,930
they really didn't pay attention what's

1289
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:47,600
going on and this would hazard<font color="#CCCCCC"> my web</font>

1290
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:49,879
services and so they started<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming to</font>

1291
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">Erin to get single IP addresses for each</font>

1292
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:53,210
one of their web servers in there and

1293
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,980
said gee no you don't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font>

1294
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:58,100
this policy says you can do virtual web

1295
00:56:54,980 --> 00:57:01,810
hosting he said well no<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can't and so</font>

1296
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:06,220
the board suspended the policy in

1297
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:08,210
September of two thousand and said okay

1298
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:11,029
this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to be discussed more</font>

1299
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:13,040
and those I said suspend it didn't

1300
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:15,560
disapprove it they didn't cancel it they

1301
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:17,840
suspended its implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> they went</font>

1302
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:20,960
back out for discussion and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

1303
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:22,160
following April at the San<font color="#CCCCCC"> Francisco</font>

1304
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,630
meeting after having gone through mail

1305
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,730
discussion and also through another

1306
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:28,310
policy discussion the policy was

1307
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:31,520
implemented but it was modified to work

1308
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:34,570
for the people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it had objected to</font>

1309
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:38,030
it so that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of how a</font>

1310
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:39,440
group can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> listed so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I also use this</font>

1311
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,730
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say you better pay</font>

1312
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,390
attention was going on at whizzes

1313
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:45,839
because you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be those web</font>

1314
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:47,609
if you're not careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> so some recent</font>

1315
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:50,069
things we've added<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process and</font>

1316
00:57:47,609 --> 00:57:52,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next iteration of the document</font>

1317
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:54,240
there's now a mandatory requirement for

1318
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:56,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">the air and general counsel to review</font>

1319
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,720
every single policy proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> beforehand</font>

1320
00:57:56,819 --> 00:58:02,730
to make sure that there is a

1321
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:06,149
determination that you can see where

1322
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:07,799
there may be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron</font>

1323
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:10,950
staff is now required to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide an</font>

1324
00:58:07,799 --> 00:58:12,690
implementation analysis you don't want

1325
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:14,308
one of the unintended consequences of

1326
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:17,099
implementing a policy is for me to go

1327
00:58:14,309 --> 00:58:19,410
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hire 20 more people it's going</font>

1328
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:21,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">to cost money or you don't want me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1329
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:23,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to build a new equipment room to</font>

1330
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,470
put in 10,000 servers do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you deal with</font>

1331
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:28,140
this thing that you thought would be

1332
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:31,049
nice thing to have so that becomes part

1333
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:33,089
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the discussion set and at the meeting</font>

1334
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:34,319
later this week you will see results of

1335
00:58:33,089 --> 00:58:40,259
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in the policies that are</font>

1336
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:43,950
currently under<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion lastly almost</font>

1337
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:45,630
lastly policy manual if you are a

1338
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:47,308
frequent user of the air<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> web site</font>

1339
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:50,849
you know the Aaron policies are kind of

1340
00:58:47,309 --> 00:58:52,470
like said this way and said that way and

1341
00:58:50,849 --> 00:58:54,599
someone got numbers and summer don't

1342
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:56,519
have numbers and they're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hard to</font>

1343
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:57,930
follow around and you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> T those guys</font>

1344
00:58:56,519 --> 00:58:59,308
are really doing a good job of<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

1345
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:02,098
sure I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand what's happening</font>

1346
00:58:59,309 --> 00:59:06,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">here and so maybe they should get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a pay</font>

1347
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:08,789
raise for that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway yeah we saw</font>

1348
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:11,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> too the board said hey this has got</font>

1349
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:16,079
to be fixed so earlier this year the

1350
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:17,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">board said fix it so Aaron staff was</font>

1351
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:19,769
given the task of taking all those

1352
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:22,339
policies if you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> at collating and</font>

1353
00:59:19,769 --> 00:59:25,950
argue in organizing them into a single

1354
00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:28,890
document if you will and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font>

1355
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:30,598
symbol single manual and so it's now

1356
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:35,038
makes it easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reference</font>

1357
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:36,660
back and forth and find things and it

1358
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:40,380
also helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect the integrity of</font>

1359
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:44,160
the documentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of self now just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1360
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:45,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">make sure that you didn't change your</font>

1361
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:48,328
policy when we set your and dissing

1362
00:59:45,779 --> 00:59:49,460
editorial work on it or<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh we didn't</font>

1363
00:59:48,329 --> 00:59:52,040
write a new one

1364
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:54,560
the Advisory Council was involved as

1365
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:58,279
well and their job<font color="#CCCCCC"> was to do first of</font>

1366
00:59:54,560 --> 01:00:02,150
all review of the proposed structure of

1367
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:03,619
the document and they did that and said

1368
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:05,150
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> this looks like a good structure</font>

1369
01:00:03,619 --> 01:00:07,010
and that's what they recommended to the

1370
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:10,190
board<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that the manual should follow</font>

1371
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:14,300
this structure then as we went through

1372
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:16,280
and made all those changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

1373
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:18,650
thing that happened was is that the

1374
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:20,420
Advisory Council there's 15 of them by

1375
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:22,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way they've broken the small teams</font>

1376
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:24,410
and each two portions with a manual and

1377
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:26,569
they went through and made sure that

1378
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:29,029
there were no changes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policies as</font>

1379
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:32,300
they were stated and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jen restated so</font>

1380
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:34,550
lastly they met and they made that

1381
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:36,440
determination and they recommended that

1382
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:38,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Board of Trustees adopt this and so</font>

1383
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:41,780
the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trustees that their meeting</font>

1384
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:44,740
on the twenty-ninth of September said

1385
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:48,109
Dave early this is now the policy

1386
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:50,750
document now all those other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1387
01:00:48,109 --> 01:00:53,869
had been the<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy document they've all</font>

1388
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:54,920
been archived so they still exist if you

1389
01:00:53,869 --> 01:00:58,280
want to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and check for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself</font>

1390
01:00:54,920 --> 01:01:00,410
and I encourage you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so if you have</font>

1391

any doubts just go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

1392
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:04,848
