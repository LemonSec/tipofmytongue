1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:09,179
ok hello everyone I'm sorry for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this</font>

2
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:11,429
when we were talking about slightly less

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">than ideal heard actually hoped it to be</font>

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,870
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> my laptop seem to have blew up</font>

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,779
as I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the movie something</font>

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,580
odia what's wrong there so uh this is

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,670
suppose the merit of having backups at

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,709
least so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the PDF version of just</font>

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,289
a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an explanation before I</font>

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:33,180
actually show a backup of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual</font>

11
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:35,010
movie so anyway just to give a current

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,050
status of where the routing tables at

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:41,040
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment I think most of you have seen</font>

14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:44,040
pictures like this many<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites many</font>

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,339
mailing lists and so forth so you see

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:51,180
the features of this this picture starts

17
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,360
just about 1994 just before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet</font>

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,870
went classless see all the big growth

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:01,219
through to 2001 the internet bust and

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,419
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gradual recovery after that</font>

21
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:08,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so that's that's the picture more</font>

22
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:11,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">just with with just one view in it in</font>

23
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">the last couple of years we can see the</font>

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,760
kind of steady growth again<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the</font>

25
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,770
recovery late two thousand and two

27
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,850

28
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,390
represented<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the Internet routing</font>

29
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,298
table today you can see various steps

30
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,400
within that just explain this Jeff's

31
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,079
view jeff has got several views of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,540
internet and these are all superimposed

33
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,460
here so again I think check his website

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,899
for the precise views that he has but if

35
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,390
you look carefully in these you see

36
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:50,009
various step functions appearing those

37
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:52,259
are due to 2<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 3 / 8 networks that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seem</font>

38
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,600
to appear and disappear at random from

39
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,310
time

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:59,048
time so we're actually yeah but that's

41
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,360
it taking just one view you can see it a

42
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:03,100
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear those jumps are all</font>

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,780

45
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:12,580

at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most specific</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advertisements in</font>

52
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,049
looks like that you saw a general d

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,670
aggregation of the internet up to two

54
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,760
thousand and one and then it's kind of

55
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,799
hovering around fifty percent or so

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,880
thereafter<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues at least has been</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you can't see the colors but</font>

it's the big the next line down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

74

bottom the three lines at the bottom you

76
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,940
remember which one refers to which but

77
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:37,590
that is if you ignore any of the path

78
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:41,230
information just do complete solid

79
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,940
removal of sub prefixes so there's a

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:48,310
fair amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> D aggregation within the</font>

83
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,700
600 or

84
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:59,560
prefixes again depending where you look

85
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:01,989
and the number of unique a SMS in v6

86
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:05,680
again is creeping up slowly around about

87
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:08,320
450 so the v6 writing-table slightly

88
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,660
bigger than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual number of a SMS</font>

89
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:17,349
out there the v6 aggregation potential

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:20,260
mole v6 internet the moment is well I

91
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:22,990
suppose better aggregated than the v4 is

92
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,849
but we're still seeing a little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

93
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:30,730
aggregation happening again probably due

to traffic engineering needs now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

along the bottom axis that is represent

the / 8 so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look along the yellow</font>

101
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,770
parts all the address space that still

00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,440
marked as I think iono reserved or or

103
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:59,890
what would I think designer reserved is

104
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,350
called so it's fairly significant amount

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> be4 address space still being held by</font>

00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:36,370
1918 address blocks now the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red</font>

115
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,110
basically represents the / aids that

116
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,090
have been allocated to the regional

117
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,270
internet registries so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

118
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,669
rars get / 8 blogs every few months so

119
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:50,049
you see those appearing quite clearly

120
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:55,060
there so of course on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the space from say</font>

121
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:56,600
193 upwards as well as around<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 80</font>

00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:01,850
in a roundabout I'm

127
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:17,799
that has been allocated by the rars but

128
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:20,930
is not routed at all it's been allocated

prior to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the RAS existing but is not</font>

130
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:28,220

131
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:31,490
light green or gray areas present in

132
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,590
this particular snapshot so we'll see

133
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,690
more of this in the movie but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

134
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,340
and remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> those colors because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

there's quite a bit of information there

fewer and fewer of them actually

appearing on internet today in v6 land

152
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:32,950
well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left-hand half of that picture</font>

153
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:35,390
shows the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 220 01 / 16 address block so</font>

154
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:37,909
allocations have started out of that

155
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,890
block is as you probably know and of

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> while the dark green has been</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right-hand side of the picture that</font>

00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:01,128
experiment and all that you see the dark

163
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:05,419
green portions are what's right it

164
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:07,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so how did we get here now</font>

165
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:09,619
unfortunately I've only got a backup of

166
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:14,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">the movie so it's not all quite as</font>

167
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:18,800
fantastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it might have been let me</font>

168
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:29,409
see I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this think I've got to do</font>

169
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:29,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">that stop stop stop stop</font>

170
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:37,299
how to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this go through okay</font>

171
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:42,370
preferences video display full screen

172
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:50,020
mode now go full screen mode how to make

173
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:54,220
a pleasure right okay um maybe if I just

174
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:58,300
do started playing you can see it I know

175
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,650
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool screen anyway right so</font>

176
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:04,000
there we go it starts starting about

177
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:06,280
1982 so most of everything is yellow so

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,790
at the top of God that before address

179
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:14,050
space the bottom the air<font color="#CCCCCC"> swampers so</font>

180
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:17,189
going through<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8485 the meters in the</font>

181
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,810
middle show you the rate of I suppose

182
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:22,080
utilization of<font color="#CCCCCC"> B phone and the air</font>

183
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:25,319
samples so early days of the internet

184
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:29,650
when i do / aids<font color="#E5E5E5"> being handed out</font>

185
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:37,380
otherwise pretty quiet also not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great</font>

186
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:37,380
deal of the essence so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go through 86</font>

187
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:46,369
so we get into 87 through to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 90s</font>

188
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:50,779
NSFNET so some of the university's

189
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:52,670
starting to get hydrous blocks starting

190
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:55,399
to use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Class B space</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we notice</font>

191
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:57,349
around 128 one or two<font color="#CCCCCC"> classes being</font>

192
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:00,079
handed out around 192 if you look

193
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:03,139
carefully now you start seeing it's

194
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:06,199
picking up the class B's get more

195
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:09,139
excited is so I think classes get more

196
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:14,779
excited still that many<font color="#E5E5E5"> class sees out</font>

197
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:20,089
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we got notice the ipv4</font>

198
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:22,600
meters showing more activity the

199
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:25,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of starting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take off</font>

200
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:29,899
more / aids or more classes class<font color="#E5E5E5"> B's</font>

201
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:32,360
appearing remember the dark green<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

202
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:33,920
what's what's being allocated what

203
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,529
what's being routed the red is what's

204
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,529
being the blocks that are being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font>

205
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:46,069
notice the Moray s numbers appearing as

206
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:47,540
well on the net these are the good old

207
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:49,459
days these are the good old days these

208
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,290
are the classful internet days look at

209
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:53,118
the IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> media it's really hammering</font>

210
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,949
through now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this shows the</font>

211
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,779
concern that people had around that time

212
00:10:54,949 --> 00:11:00,319
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out at b4</font>

213
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:04,610
space so if the captain said the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rush is</font>

214
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:10,368
really starting now more class a's Class

215
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:12,170
B explosions happening through 92 still

216
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:15,230
not many a s<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so not a great deal</font>

217
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:20,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">of networks now we start transitioning</font>

218
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:23,350
to cider and the are our system starts

219
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:27,290
jumping into life still more class b

220
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:29,360
consumption and so forth but notice the

221
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,819
former class c space<font color="#E5E5E5"> 19</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tuned above</font>

222
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,929
those more allocations of routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:34,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">prefixes happening there</font>

224
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,050
this is

225
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,730
no unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> music is on my dead</font>

226
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,410
laptop which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great shame because</font>

227
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,560
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> music that goes with this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just makes</font>

228
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:51,270
it that anyway because you know that

229
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,589
what the song at the moment is money

230
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:56,370
money money you know because it's

231
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:58,140
explosion<font color="#CCCCCC"> internationals might also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

232
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:00,180
it's a great shame famed you knows how

233
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:07,860
to fix<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows 2000</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shorted using a</font>

234
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:11,040
mallet let me know so 96 so again<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

235
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,320
you see that the IP usage growth is slow

236
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,930
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> meters one or two and this shows</font>

237
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,210
this success of the register system as a

238
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:20,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">Scott a pointed out earlier that really</font>

239
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,680
had put the brakes on the growth of the

240
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:27,810
address consumption very little growth

241
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:30,270
in the in the farmer<font color="#CCCCCC"> clase blogs now</font>

242
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:33,449
jeff has actually got access to the

243
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:36,990
registry allocation data so that's why

244
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:38,910
you see what's being allocated fastest

245
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:43,080
what's being routed so that's appeared

246
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:44,850
in as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so you look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whoo okay Susan</font>

247
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:50,640
what's happened that's just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen</font>

248
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:52,530
savers<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so you see in the form of</font>

249
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,660
class a bluff<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's quite a lot of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">address space that's allocated but not</font>

251

write it and look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the growth of the a</font>

252
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,810

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting bit going through 2000 and</font>

so forth the more more organizations

probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming and so forth the s</font>

256
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:11,040
number growth is massive and one thing

257
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:14,390
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is quite clear from this</font>

258
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:18,839
that the advent of the 4-byte asn umber

259
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:20,970
should be thought of more than probably

260
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,460
looking at a large address<font color="#E5E5E5"> space because</font>

261
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,440
the rate they<font color="#CCCCCC"> SN's are going we've</font>

262
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:30,720
probably only got three four<font color="#E5E5E5"> years left</font>

263
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,790
this sort of rate ok so the bust

264
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,130
happened notice one thing with the bus

265
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,750
does a lot of address space has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>
