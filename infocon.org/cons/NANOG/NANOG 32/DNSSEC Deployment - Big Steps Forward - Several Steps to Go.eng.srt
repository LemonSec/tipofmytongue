introduction thank you did you flip the

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,289
Bill I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">deployment of the DNS security protocol</font>

8
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:33,840

13
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:50,730
somewhat larger effort where the the

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:55,530
essence of this whole project that been

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:57,839
described here is a community building

16
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,359
exercise to try to get everybody moving

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,539
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same direction and untangle the</font>

18
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,549
problems that occur in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process so</font>

19
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,420
let me walk through the pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

20
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:13,500
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the view is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are</font>

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,920
actually some real threats that dnf

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,439
security can be helpful in addressing

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,680
here's a handful of them listed it's

24
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,080
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get into serious arguments</font>

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,380
about are these<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the threats are</font>

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:32,189
these threats real how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are</font>

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:35,220
being exploited these days such a

28
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,529
discussion can go off tracks weird

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,229
versions of it are how<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we stimulate</font>

30
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,119
more attacks so that we can demonstrate

31
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:47,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the necessity of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pmf security I don't</font>

32
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:50,549
want to go there but there is a there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,850
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that says there's</font>

34
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:56,810
spoofing of very sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS and there</font>

35
00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:04,259
are opportunities to give more violence

36
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:06,140
waiting to happen dns security was once

37
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,889
upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> a time and extremely urgent</font>

immediate problem

39
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:13,329
there were some demonstrations in the

40
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">early 90s that led to concern at high</font>

levels in the US<font color="#CCCCCC"> government which</font>

42
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,760
resulted in very quick action Vint Cerf

43
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,470
called me up urgently one day and said

44
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,820
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix this and we started a</font>

45
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:30,630
major project and the project continued

46
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,560
and continued and continued the

47
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:37,209
specifications have gone through three

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,550
major cycles and are now<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally in see</font>

49
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:41,500
what's the official status<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've made</font>

a pass last call and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been sent to</font>

52
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,130
essentially done except for the

53
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,549
publication cycle which also takes

54
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:55,000
forever there's been some big strides to

55
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:58,180
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS security operationally viable</font>

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,019
in these iterations so for example one

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:04,030
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big changes was the relationship</font>

58
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,370
of a parent zone to a child's own which

59
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,730
you'll see in a minute was too tight

60
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,290
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and led</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great operational</font>

difficulties whenever changes need to be

62
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:18,190
made now that's been set apart enough so

63
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:20,890
that the pieces can be updated<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

64
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:23,019
independently they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

65
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:27,070
spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> making these specs more robust and</font>

66
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:30,870
now a coordinated global effort to grow

67
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:33,640
the deployed base so we're hopeful

68
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,320
despite some people who looked at this

69
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:40,000
whole process<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a distance and say</font>

70
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:41,290
it's taken too long and give me we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,360
know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever going to happen we're</font>

72
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,489
hopeful<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the time</font>

73
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,160
but it's not going to happen completely

74
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:51,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">on its own there's too many parts that</font>

as you will see<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have some diagrams</font>

109
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:33,090
of those lead to some fairly intricate

110
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,460
and detailed discussions if we have time

111
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,289
i'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be happy to engage in those</font>

112
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussions so here's what the</font>

113
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:42,900
end-to-end protection looks like you

114
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:46,530
have a trusted key is this this shows

115
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:49,560
you have a trusted key at the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

116
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:55,679
signs the zone for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top-level domain</font>

117
00:05:49,560 --> 00:06:00,030
and then there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a d/s key for signing</font>

118
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,460
the the key for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next zone and so</font>

119
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,049
forth on down we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hierarchy of</font>

120
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:08,460
keys and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a pair of keys</font>

121
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:10,530
at each level one that signs the

122
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,830
individual entries within the zone and

123
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,549
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is signing the the key signing</font>

124
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,469
key

125
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,140
well for the for the for the whole zone

126
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,990
and that double key arrangement is what

127
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,969
provides the manageability for making

128
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:28,110
changes within his own without having

129
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:30,720
that trickle up to the parent zone and

130
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,030
cause tremendous set of changes here's

131
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,410
what dns operations look like in an

132
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:37,169
unsigned environment you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an</font>

133
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:41,400
unsigned child zone and unsigned parent

134
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:44,160
zone and glue information and then the

135
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,320
parent zone whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a change</font>

136
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:52,800
made reloads the<font color="#E5E5E5"> parent zone and this</font>

137
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:57,740
not very<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy child is waiting for the</font>

138
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:00,360
correct information to appear in DNS SEC

139
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,940
operations things are a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> complex</font>

140
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,090
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys have to be generated and</font>

141
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:09,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">then used for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> signing the elements of</font>

142
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:12,510
the zone and then that information has

143
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:16,500
to be exchanged preferably in a secure

144
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:18,870
fashion<font color="#CCCCCC"> and else some of the protection</font>

152
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,090
information so now going to look briefly

153
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,030
at several points of view and see what

154
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,369
has to change so from the registrant's

155
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,320
point of view that's typically an

156
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,060
enterprise what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> different well they</font>

158
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,560
management they have to engage in their

159
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,479
own zone signing operations and they

160
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,520
have to provision the name server and

161
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,410
they have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way of securely</font>

162
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,770
transmitting the DNS SEC related

00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:14,730
information to the registrar and all of

164
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:18,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all of that only gives the zone</font>

165
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:21,600
sign and the the signature is propagated

166
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,430
but to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be to be really useful they</font>

167
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,490
should actually check signatures from

168
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,110
time to time I'm being

169
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,889
seizures<font color="#CCCCCC"> that reject</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them all the time</font>

170
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:34,430
so you have to have validating resolvers

171
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:35,779
that provide security checking and then

172
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,489
every once in a while something goes

173
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:39,708
wrong or there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are updates and so forth</font>

174
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:43,149
so incident handling is required from

175
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:45,140
the registrar's point of view that

176
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:46,310
information they have the complementary

177
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,770
side of it the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information has to be</font>

178
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,229
received from the registrant and then

179
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:54,260
has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be transmitted into the registry</font>

180
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:57,230
and and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course there will be a need</font>

181
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:00,760
for handling changes and incidents and

182
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:03,910
so forth from the registry point of view

183
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,709
several<font color="#CCCCCC"> things need to be done obviously</font>

184
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:09,980

191

and protecting the private key is

192
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,520
obviously a very strong concern leading

193
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:36,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to lots of discussions some of which are</font>

pragmatic and some of which are

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,899
religious about what kinds of risks are

nervous about that there are some

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:53,390
operational issues in that the size of a

upon various parameters of the signing

so that each record in the zone is is

205
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,810
that much bigger and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course so it</font>

206

207

transmitting that record that takes up

208
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:21,620
the same additional amount of bandwidth

209
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:23,500
so this puts<font color="#E5E5E5"> some pressure from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

important that is and

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,839
question of the computational power

required to create the signatures in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

first place signing operations typically

228
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:13,329
are computationally intensive and it's

229
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,579
not a big deal if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have very</font>

obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a lot better if you can</font>

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:34,600
get this job done offline and then

237
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,310
provision those signed records but then

what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do when you have to make</font>

to do it in the the sort of expected way

249
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:19,600
to do it is to deliver up a span an

<font color="#E5E5E5">zero subah zones that have been signed</font>

nothing's happening eventually there

333
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:36,580
clumsy mixture of partial of some zones

00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:39,250
that are signed and many zones that are

335

<font color="#CCCCCC">gana SEC aware and someone or not what</font>

00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:49,390
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do if you make a request for a</font>

338
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:52,090
signed entry and an unsigned entry comes

00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,620
back do you trust it anyway well today

340
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:56,070
the answer it better be yes because

341
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:59,230
that's as good as you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get</font>

342
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:01,360
down the line when<font color="#E5E5E5"> most things are saw</font>

343
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:06,130
outside the answer may be no

344
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,660
a more useful intermediate position is

345
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,880
you may have reason to believe that

346
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">certain zones are signed and if you get</font>

347
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,990
back an unsigned answer then you should

348
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,010
be suspicious of it where would such a

349
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:20,709
reason come from so the notion of trust

350
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,809
anchors<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist where there's multiple</font>

the parents are not yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a position to</font>

separate trust anger and then that then

357
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,090
leads to the operational question of how

side effect of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current protocol plus</font>

379
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:47,350
a expected implementation is that it

00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,270
makes it easy to walk through a zone and

381

<font color="#E5E5E5">discover each and every entry in a</font>

00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:59,440
now some subsequent investigations as to

whether there are ways to thwart that or

385
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:09,000
alternative implementations there's

386
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:12,750

00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:57,940
manage the key at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root this is not</font>

440
00:21:54,879 --> 00:22:01,238
technically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very hard or interesting</font>

441
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:04,200
problem taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> by itself just the</font>

442
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:06,460
extraordinary level of visibility and

443
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,009
multiple agendas that attend to that

444
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:12,789
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting problem as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

445
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:16,629
are there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any applications that fit</font>

446
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:21,369
together with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the NF sec so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

447
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:24,629
would serve<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a major accelerator or to</font>

448
00:22:21,369 --> 00:22:27,389
propel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a must-have situation</font>

449
00:22:24,629 --> 00:22:31,988
possibly we're still waiting for

450
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:35,228
specifics to emerge and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

451
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:39,789
trust anchors it's not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad if you</font>

452
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:41,950
have 1 2 3 10 20 50 trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> members it</font>

453
00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:43,749
gets hard if you have hundreds and

454
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:46,779
thousands of trust anchors then you have

455
00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:48,849
a whole new system if one examines the

456
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:50,799
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the natural arc we're going to</font>

457
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:52,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">start with a very small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number of trust</font>

458
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,719
anchors it's going to grow and

459
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:58,629
eventually the need for separate trust

460
00:22:55,719 --> 00:23:01,059
anchors will disappear as the tree is

461
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:03,399
filled in and it's that intermediate

462
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:05,609
stage where the tree is not very well

463
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:08,379
filled in but there's still enough there

464
00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:11,408
that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know quite how messy all</font>

465
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:13,299
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get here's some</font>

466
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:16,119
resources I think these slides are

467
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:20,259
available online so there's no need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

468
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:22,449
scribble very hard and that's the quick

469
00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:25,879
tour through the DNS SEC deployment

470
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:42,989
activities today

471
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:50,699
we have time for questions um any

472
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:52,409
questions Sam where are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I they</font>

473
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,789
would expect Sam whether to stand up

474
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:57,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since i'm already up here I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can ask</font>

475
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:59,070
some questions but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Spencer you have</font>

476
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">this August panel you can ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him you</font>

477
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:06,829
don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask Steve he's already</font>

478
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:10,259
talked a lot and LSD algis panel uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

479
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:11,989
noticed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just had the president</font>

480
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:17,190
presentation that was talking about

481
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:19,469
larger resource records and the

482
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:22,589
increased incidence of truncation and

483
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:25,259
TCP retrievals which may succeed or my

484
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:31,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">fail where are you guys than picking it</font>

485
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:34,200
through it is it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a concern yeah it</font>

486
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:36,529
is um the thing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there enough</font>

487
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,639
code changes required for DNS SEC anyway

488
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:40,229
that what we ended up doing was saying

489
00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:42,349
you have to support ian has<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero in</font>

490
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:44,369
order to do DNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> SEC just is no other way</font>

491
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:47,718
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there there a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons for</font>

492
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:47,718
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the size issue is one of them</font>

493
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:57,089
go ahead roots

494
00:24:54,509 --> 00:25:00,959
well yeah as Rob said<font color="#E5E5E5"> ed and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a zero</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

495
00:24:57,089 --> 00:25:03,958
really essential for the success of DNS

496
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:05,879
security deployment because the talk

497
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:08,479
before it was talking about describing

498
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:11,509
what was happening falling back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

499
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:15,539
frankly that's that's just an untenable

500
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:17,779
solution and won't work there is one

501
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:20,849
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to note in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that context though the</font>

502
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:22,469
way that the protocol works you don't

503
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:23,668
have to upgrade every step resolver in

504
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:24,749
the world to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting the benefits</font>

505
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:26,399
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so it's not like you have to</font>

506
00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:30,919
have media<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 and all this stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> resolve</font>

507
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:33,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">it it's the protocol</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the verifying</font>

508
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:35,009
resolvers those are validating resolvers

509
00:25:33,629 --> 00:25:37,498
up to the authoritative name servers

510
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:39,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">rainy duty net zero the rest of it is</font>

511
00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:44,519
optional it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

512
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:49,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't strictly need it thanks Bill</font>

513
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:50,940
this is sam Weller I didn't hear a

514
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:53,759
specific list of what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want the</font>

515
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in this room to do what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would you</font>

516
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:59,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">like for them to do and why is it safe</font>

517
00:25:55,889 --> 00:26:03,978
to do that those are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

518
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:06,989
questions of course take them in order I

519
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:09,749
want let's see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I want the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

520
00:26:06,989 --> 00:26:14,879
in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> room to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm learn to spell</font>

521
00:26:09,749 --> 00:26:20,539
DNS SEC would be first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing more</font>

522
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:25,079
seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think two things one is</font>

523
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:27,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">focus attention on DNS SEC as if it were</font>

524
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:31,668
real and think about implementation and

525
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:33,989
what it takes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> either do it or to</font>

526
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:37,199
cause the organizations that you're

527
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:41,389
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it and the other side</font>

528
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:45,119
of that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback and participation</font>

529
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:48,899
identify what the issues are whether

530
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:50,759
they're resource issues or technical

531
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:52,738
problems or operational problems or

532
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,829
missing tools or missing documents and

533
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:56,969
so forth and get involved and be vocal

534
00:26:55,829 --> 00:27:01,859
about that so those are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two things</font>

535
00:26:56,969 --> 00:27:03,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it now why is it safe well you can</font>

536
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:07,030
trust us

537
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:10,940
I don't know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font>

538
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:13,370
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me make one additional up hello okay</font>

539
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:16,250
one additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> response there and that</font>

540
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:19,010
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Steve mentioned earlier that that</font>

541
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:21,490
this is actually the third basic design

542
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:25,580
of the of how we're going to do

543
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:27,650
validation of dns information and quite

544
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,870
frankly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason the first two designs</font>

545
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:32,030
weren't the biggest single reason that

546
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:35,149
they weren't successful is they did not

547
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:38,480
take enough into consideration what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

548
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:40,580
operational realities were as we've gone

549
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,190
through this particular redesign there's

550
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,899
been a tremendous<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee larger amount of</font>

551
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,240
involvement<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the Opera from the</font>

552
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,370
operational community but we need more

553
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,970
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all the feedback we</font>

554
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:54,830
possibly can we'd love to have people

555
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:57,170
practice signing some zones right now we

556
00:27:54,830 --> 00:28:00,020
have some experience some experiments on

557
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:03,170
going and anybody that would consider

558
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:05,900
just running a sign zone for a bit get

559
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:08,510
in touch with<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone of us and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll we</font>

560
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:11,210
will happily work with additional folks

561
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:14,870
to start actually going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

562
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:16,970
mechanics of running sign zones so that

563
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:20,449
everybody learns more as we go forward

564
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:22,460
and one of the important things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

565
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:25,670
for us that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get it</font>

566
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,620
deployed is to get it in worked into

567
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:31,070
your normal workflow whatever your

568
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:34,850
normal workflow is and and to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as</font>

569
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:37,129
as little disruption as possible and so

570
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:39,560
to do that we really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

571
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:42,110
additional input from people as to how

572
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:48,590
they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do go about running their</font>

573
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:49,610
zones today yeah so it's so start

574
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,720
thinking about how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would</font>

575
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:55,550
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this in your office</font>

576
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:57,590
procedures that leave the mics on so my

577
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:59,000
answer to sams question would be we need

578
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">to know what the office procedures are</font>

579
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,180
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff and it's not we sitting</font>

580
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,129
up here at the front of the room do but

581
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,570
in order for this to work the people

582
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,100
actually running systems out there need

583
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to think</font>

584

how they're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this and tell</font>

us what they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we screwed up you</font>

586
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,309

587
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,600
workflow can't be made to fit into your

<font color="#E5E5E5">workflows or some better way we should</font>

590
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,260
this have you got all the pieces in

591
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,360
place to actually securely get the

592
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,470
information from here to bear can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

598
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:34,270
the database of the data is going into

599
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,860
can you make this follow that all that

600
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:37,510
kind of stuff it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,950
stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there and ask another question</font>

604
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:52,440
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Michael to come on up and</font>

605
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:57,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">get prepped for your presentation next</font>

606
00:29:52,440 --> 00:30:01,320
very short questions and even shorter

607
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,320
replies because I do<font color="#CCCCCC"> want the last word</font>

608
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:07,090
thank you Bill Maher coasters verisign

609
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:09,340
and this is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a plea</font>

610
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:11,199
we've had that we talked about up

611
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,539
operations are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to look</font>

612
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,610
at DNS I can and appoint a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

613
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:18,429
from the registry side but we've had

614
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:20,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've not had a lot of success on doing</font>

615
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:23,890
sort of recursive name server management

616
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:26,080
and that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually play a big</font>

617
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:28,600
part of because many of you run some

618
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,090
barely very large recursive name server

619
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:34,928
farms and information coming back from

620
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:37,199
that would be extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful what he</font>

621
00:30:34,929 --> 00:30:37,200
said

622
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:47,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you very much gentlemen</font>

623
00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:50,119
further questions grab any one of them

624
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:51,470
in the halls one of the things while

625
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:53,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">he's getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use this</font>

626
00:30:51,470 --> 00:31:00,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">Michael let me just move out of the way</font>

627
00:30:53,419 --> 00:31:03,859
i will use<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will use this microphone</font>

628
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:05,479
because you can't hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> me otherwise one</font>

629
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:10,189
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that Steve was talking</font>

630
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:13,639
about it DNS SEC and registries and

631
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:15,529
forward stuff remember that the other

632
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:19,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">side of the DNS is the reverse map and</font>

633
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:22,429
as ISPs you have address blocks that you

634
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:24,739
manage so think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you would deal</font>

635
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:26,419
with the key management issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> and those</font>

636
00:31:24,739 --> 00:31:31,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">things for the addresses that you're</font>

637
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:32,659
assigned so that it may in fact be more

638
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:36,200
applicable than you might have thought

639
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:37,609
in the past so again last<font color="#E5E5E5"> round of</font>

640
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,820
applause for these guys get them off the

641
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,820
stage
