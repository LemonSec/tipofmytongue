1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay welcome to this talk and thank</font>

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:09,179
you Steve for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice introduction</font>

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,010
since this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the last talked before the</font>

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,969
coffee break<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll try to make this quick</font>

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,710
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> painless and second slide this is</font>

6
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,119
the one and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see why steeps think</font>

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,890
this is a very interested interestings

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,230
like had I realized of course that it

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,630
would be on the front bench to check my

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,910
quotes with lot of triple checks and

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,599
what I was quoting you actually

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,180
accurately so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opened a whole bass but</font>

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,820
this talk was satisfied by<font color="#E5E5E5"> steve's</font>

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,300
presentation to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana in Miami a couple</font>

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,239
of months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago where he talks about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,809
vast experience in internet exchanges

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,788
over the years and he goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a list of</font>

18
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:52,050
mrs. and you've come across from that

19
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:54,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">turned out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be well yes so as I quoted</font>

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,730
here myth number one on this list or

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,949
like that one a lot and which that 10

22
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,230
megabits is enough and of course with

23
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,120
today's hindsight that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

24
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,298
can we can smile upon us with some

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,580
tenderness at least things have changes

26
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,700
it but back in those days things

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,890
relevant now as Steve said back then

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,180
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was great until it got full and</font>

29
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,119
this is basically where I got<font color="#CCCCCC"> tricky</font>

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that it got full that's what we</font>

31
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,759
have a lot of times it's as well so I

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,369
could relate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and so what we</font>

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,100
wanted to try here today is give you

34
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:33,210
some example we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it gets</font>

35
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:35,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">born</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in our domain and what we do the</font>

36
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,100
bottom it is done in terms of upgrading

37
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,139
and particularly how we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font>

38
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,658
done

39
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,549
a good job easier lives with

40
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,030
implementing optical switching<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

41
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:51,439
and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we'll be focusing on</font>

42
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,360
here what you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a typical</font>

43
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,339
diagram of in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> case this is</font>

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,600
accumulated customer traffic over our

45
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,610
public public facilities over a number

46
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,970
of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see there is</font>

47
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:10,019
of course a healthy growth figure well

48
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:11,819
maybe be too healthy but definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

49
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:13,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is not coming as</font>

50
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,450
any surprise you probably looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

51
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:17,790
this say oh well exponential<font color="#CCCCCC"> Balraj</font>

52
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,980
that's what we're having what we're

53
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,950
seeing every week ourselves but what

54
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">this definitely means for us is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

55
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:28,200
keeps us pretty busy in terms of keeping

56
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,230
the network in shape upgrading

57
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,390
explaining etc for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance over the</font>

58
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,390
last couple of months<font color="#E5E5E5"> of last year</font>

59
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,059
basically we have upgraded off our edge

60
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:42,988
our customer connecting equipment from

61
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:45,780
family iron core platform platforms into

62
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:48,569
a next generation family jet cord for

63
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,130
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to to offer trunks</font>

64
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:53,608
<font color="#E5E5E5">gigabit ethernet connections to our</font>

65
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,230
customers and but that's not entirely

66
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:57,359
the focus of historical in the forms of

67
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,190
this talk is another aspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

68
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:01,470
migration and the changes that was grown

69
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,660
through and that is that we've changed

70
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:08,100
our infrastructure from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ring into a</font>

71
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,720
spoke up topology and traditionally or

72
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:13,709
at least for the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years</font>

73
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network are our infrastructure</font>

74
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,299
looked like four node four

75
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:20,639
interconnected locations for foundry

76
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,609
switches connecting our<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gigabit Ethernet</font>

77
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,250
and Pharisees<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their customers</font>

78
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:27,600
interconnected by<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten gate links and one</font>

79
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,819
of the issues we had with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tree</font>

80
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,549
structure was that we were seeing that

81
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:36,190
the internal volumes internal traffic

82
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:39,550
was was exceeding and<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing in the</font>

83
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:41,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">nishi and particularly because of course</font>

84
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need to scale the entire platform and</font>

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,630
all the links involved to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

86
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,390
cover the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backup load in case of lean</font>

87
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,640
failure scenarios and we were hoping we

88
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,279
were expecting we were counting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

89
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,799
fact that by transforming our network

90
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,720
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> his fog spoke up topology we would</font>

91
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,150
at least reduce the amount of internal

92
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,120
traffic second argument to consider

93
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:07,920
going over to you spoke up topology was

94
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,480
the fact that we were getting basically

95
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,829
this relates back to discussions

96
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,250
internally we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> two in the summer of</font>

97
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,500
2003 and at that point in time we were

98
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,660
getting the first customer demand or

99
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,600
inquiries about providing 10 Gigabit

100
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,490
Ethernet customer connections and we

101
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,140
couldn't look back then and we were

102
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,970
think what we were thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we</font>

103
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,990
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to in order to provide</font>

104
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:34,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and providing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them from a central</font>

105
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,400
point out in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> network compared to</font>

106
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">providing from all of the edge notes</font>

107
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,460
looked as a preferred scenario to us

108
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,250
firstly because the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it would</font>

109
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,530
help us to again increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decrease</font>

110
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:52,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">the amount of internal tracker traffic</font>

111
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:53,890
or at least decrease growth of that and

112
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,690
secondly of course by providing the

113
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,210
negative Ethernet to customers from a

114
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,010
central location that would reduce the

115
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,320
amount of initial hardware costs

116
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:07,390
involved to provide content Gigabit

117
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,940
Ethernet a third argument that work for

118
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">us or that we that we felt was supposed</font>

119
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">elephant what's the fact that in general</font>

120
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,580
we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that expansion could be</font>

121
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,770
handled more easily in a platform you

122
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,300
spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> of environment in terms of adding</font>

123
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,090
additional notes adding a new so-called

124
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:25,060
size but of course with with these

125
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:28,690
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> Addison point decided to migrate</font>

126
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:31,270
into a spoke up environment that we

127
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely had a major concern or what</font>

128
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,560
we had several<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerns but at least one</font>

129
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,420
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our concerns was was how to go about</font>

130
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,590
implementing this and not

131
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,960
getting massive road work on the

132
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:44,049
platform for a significant or even for a

133
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,760
smaller period of time so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where</font>

134
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,370
the optical switches the photonic

135
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:52,289
switches came into our into our thinking

136
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:56,320
and that's what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into now</font>

137
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:58,360
with this presentation firstly what is

138
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,170
optical switching in the way we applied

139
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,450
it well or<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is what is not actually</font>

140
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we have not implemented is what i</font>

141
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,170
would call packet switching in<font color="#CCCCCC"> y'all</font>

142
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,090
optical domain that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe something</font>

143
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:13,300
that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> initially think of when they</font>

144
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,789
hear about optical switching it's not

145
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,470
what you read about in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the press in</font>

146
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,650
terms of London switching what what you

147
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:22,240
need to think about in our case is

148
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:24,940

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,490

192
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,900

all of the the interconnecting to do and

the memory in the box there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is some</font>

modest amount of signal loss this might

204

like to make it more readable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> db's</font>

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,500
which is well it's not how I but it of

206
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:56,950
course it can be an essential amount of

207

season loss in some<font color="#CCCCCC"> boundary cases and</font>

208
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,390
then we have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've had some</font>

reliability reliability issues with the

<font color="#CCCCCC">course well since then fortunately in</font>

214
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,079
the boxes have been running very

smoothly and most importantly despite

216
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:21,099
these these hardware issues we've had no

297
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:53,140
now into this environment we<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduce</font>

298
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,689
the first photonic switch and went on to

299
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,340
add some links into the platform

300
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:00,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">rearranged some backup links and some of</font>

301
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:03,730
our active links and of course added the

302
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,800
first door switch and as you if you look

303
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this diagram we're still in the in</font>

304

305
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual transition to</font>

306
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:16,230
stop bulk up the proper topology is

307
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:20,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">always the proverbial push of the button</font>

308
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:25,050
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what we basically did by</font>

309
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:28,950
transitioning to the by reconfiguring a

310

set of active<font color="#CCCCCC"> links active and inactive</font>

311
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:34,850
links that were flowing through the

312
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:37,620
photonics which we transitioned from a

313
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,630
ring topology to a spark up topology as

314
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,520
you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the actual</font>

315
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,980
transition was not entirely as

316
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,870
instantaneous as this presentation of

317
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,820
course is suggesting what was it was

318
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:50,550
close to that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font>

319
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,680
switchover of the individual links via

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,930
the photonics which is in your honor of

321
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,750
a few hundred milliseconds and of course

322
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:01,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">running stp or rapid stp as was the case</font>

323
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:04,980
in our in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation the transition</font>

324
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:07,829
took a bit of time because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the risk</font>

325
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,470

00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,600
all in all this this first switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

327
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:15,620

now in our next in my next example

330
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:25,530
that's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a bit later later</font>

335
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,670
the same topology although I've

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,250
rearranged all the boxes at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom</font>

337
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,800
now you see our H nodes at the top

338
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:44,490
there's the core note and the packets

enabling the the links<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are grayed</font>

358
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:37,209
out in this slide unfortunately at this

359
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,500
stage<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the at this station in the</font>

360
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:42,850
inner migration what we had there was

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">two core boxes that were actually</font>

delivery buses because what the

00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:51,910
intention<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that we would provide we</font>

network elements with foundry which have

366
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,240
longer devices which were at the time

367
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,370
that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start implementing these</font>

368
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,720
which were not<font color="#CCCCCC"> available yet at least in</font>

369
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,089
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> view would they were not ready for</font>

370
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,820
prime time so what we did it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

371
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:08,529
reimplemented temporary core systems

372
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,500
with family regarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> Big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Island</font>

373
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:13,320
switches and of course well or maybe not

374
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,870
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course but what on the show here is</font>

375
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,839
that at a certain point in time when we

376
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:22,510
were convinced that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was was</font>

377
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,690
quite stable and things were<font color="#CCCCCC"> hunky dory</font>

378
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:27,550
we started to we started to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for</font>

379
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,040
trouble again of course by bringing

380
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">additional equipment which was the new</font>

381
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,740
witcha ground the devices labeled MGA th

382
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:39,160
one here so again the pack the photonics

383
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:41,529
which gave us the option of easily

384
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:45,930
switch over to switch over between what

385
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:48,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">was their core</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> core two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to mgh one and</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course with that switch off were</font>

387
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:52,900
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> place in the back of environment</font>

388
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:54,310
the photonics which was not as essential

389
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,380
there as it was in the previous example

390
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,209
however the real value of having a

391
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,130
photonic switch in here was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually in</font>

392
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:02,439
the fact that we could easily transition

393
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:05,230
back to the situation with a core<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a</font>

394
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,199
core two bucks so transition to the big

395
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">islands and move away from the nth into</font>

396
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:10,839
in case that it had turned out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

398
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,869
functioning in our life environment as

399
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,869
it had as it was expected now this

400
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:21,399
didn't happen but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> core function of</font>

401
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:23,168
the earth of the photonics which there

402
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,760
was to provide us with that without

403
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:29,789
value with capability of returning<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

404
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:32,679
now the third example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have for you is</font>

405
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:33,940
actually coming pretty close to if you

406
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,710
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this diagram it's going pretty</font>

407
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:41,380
close to our network network as it is

<font color="#CCCCCC">build up today what you see here is</font>

409
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,039
again the double star topology you see

00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:03,309
the way we implement that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brazilian Lee</font>

438
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:05,770
is by hooking up via photonics which

439
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:07,510
number one in this example and photonics

440
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,090
which number one actually takes care of

441
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:15,070
the connectivity from the customer

442
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:18,209
router<font color="#CCCCCC"> unto the active core switch and</font>

443
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:20,530
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case of a vsop state change that</font>

444
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,300
that's the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the</font>

445
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,660
photonics which<font color="#E5E5E5"> control demon that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

446
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,649
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier in one of my slides</font>

447
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,080
actually kicks in which is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

448
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:32,860
software running on our external

449
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:35,230
external control system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the software</font>

450
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:40,000
is being triggered by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use of these</font>

451
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:43,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">stages and instructs automatically</font>

452
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,150
instructs in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> PSW one to</font>

453
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:50,380
reconfigure the connection from the

454
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:54,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">customer out from mgh to on to mgh one</font>

455
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:56,440
so what you see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reconfigured</font>

456
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network gone over to the backups state</font>

457
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:03,760
where omgah one is now taking control

458
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:05,950
via photonics which number two and all

459
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:12,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the previously in active links have</font>

460
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:16,300
been have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been activated okay one one</font>

461
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:18,880
thing to out here this with tested is

462
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,820
this model in our labs and we've also

463
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,190
worked with a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ed customers and</font>

464
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:27,280
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this model works fine and there's</font>

465
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,780
only one funny well as funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> haha but an</font>

466
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting aspect that we've noticed</font>

467
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:34,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">with some of our some of our customer</font>

468
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,850
routers that we disagreed and that's

469
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,399
that with a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of very fast customer</font>

470
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:43,090
routers we saw that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual switch</font>

471
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:46,450
out the period took longer and after

472
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:48,580
looking at in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some detail the for the</font>

473
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:51,190
moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think that the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

474
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,050
this happens is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> faster</font>

475
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,510
the faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> model</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of routers that we have</font>

476
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:59,680
connected up there in in these tests

477
00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:01,480
actually have<font color="#E5E5E5"> detect a link failure or</font>

478
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">declare early failure on to at the</font>

479
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,010
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the link is swapped to the</font>

480
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:09,850
other side which is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like up to</font>

481
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:11,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">a few hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> milliseconds reconnection</font>

482
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,620
time so the faster route<font color="#CCCCCC"> was actually</font>

483
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,540
declared a link failure and have need

484
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,939
more time to reestablish linked whereas

485
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:22,930
other routers do not detect early

486
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:25,370
failure and just keep alive<font color="#CCCCCC"> a link up so</font>

487
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:28,400
with that I'm almost done coming

488
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:32,179
this slides and asking myself or asking

489
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:35,120
as you are we done well<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously having</font>

490
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,890
learned from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve's list of myths we're</font>

491
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,439
not nearly done and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't expect to</font>

492
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:42,230
be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in near future as quoting</font>

493
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,480
again from from the list myth number six

494
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,520
from steve was under megabits per second

495
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,850
is enough well still my bike<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would say</font>

496
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">and but the real lesson there of course</font>

497
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,740
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should have think that</font>

498
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:56,750
by implementing this new fancy enabling

499
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,610
technology you said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've saved your</font>

500
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:01,550
life you've maybe bought<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of time</font>

501
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:04,389
to prepare yourself forward in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

502
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:07,040
series of<font color="#CCCCCC"> james</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and looking at today's</font>

503
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,809
traffic patterns we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently at</font>

504
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,730
something like sodium gigabits per

505
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:13,010
second peak traffic on on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our platform</font>

506
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:16,190
and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the growth growth</font>

507
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:17,540
growth predictions based on history we

508
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,250
can expect something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font>

509
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:23,059
gigabits per second by the end of next

510
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:25,820
year as the peak volume to take take

511
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:28,490
care of on the platform and that's

512
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:30,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty scary so we need to start</font>

513
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,690
planning today also plenty is a bit

514
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,760
optimistic because we know we all need

515
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:38,350
equipment that's not on a market today

516
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:41,420
we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll probably technology that's</font>

517
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:46,010
what most<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely not even in the vendors</font>

518
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:48,650
labs today so we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite some</font>

519
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,870
changes ahead of us and but definitely

520
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,970
we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and one of the</font>

521
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,340
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> released to be</font>

sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasonably sure of based on our</font>

00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience today is that will have the</font>

00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,460
photonic switches in the middle<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

there to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide us with their great</font>
