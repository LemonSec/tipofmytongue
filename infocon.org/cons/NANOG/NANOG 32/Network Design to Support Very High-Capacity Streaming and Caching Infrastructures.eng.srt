1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,980
alright so basically I'm Vijay Gill and

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,019
this is chris right Chris Wright is

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,849
actually one of the engineers who works

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,990
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same group as I do and we are</font>

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:18,090
responsible for media access and dashing

6
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,560
part of the network and I'll explain

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,800
some of the other parts of the networks

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,470
that we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them so when I started</font>

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,750
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for AOL when Mom asked Anne Hurd</font>

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,250
called me up from India and said hey I

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,380
heard you're working for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> now what</font>

12
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,300
are you doing there somes like hey mom

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,519
you know when you log<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to AOL and you</font>

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,949
have mail and the voice says you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,950
mail well guess what the warehouse

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,020
filled with thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and I'm</font>

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,940
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and if you have mail I speak</font>

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">into this little microphone you've got</font>

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,099
mail so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> been two years and my mom</font>

20
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,660
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to like log onto and</font>

21
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:57,210
check her email and hoping to hear my

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,858
voice so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this point I should</font>

23
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,680
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell her that that's not going</font>

24
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">to happen it's a pre-recorded voice but</font>

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,340
you let it<font color="#CCCCCC"> go for now</font>

26
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:08,520
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look at the problem</font>

27
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,740
space

28
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,750
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to solve here because</font>

29
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,119
although some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the stuff we do is cool</font>

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,939
nobody's really paying us especially in

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,799
this environment post-crash to play with

32
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,048
cool stuff we actually have business

33
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,579
problems to solve and we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

34
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:28,829
them and AOL has a huge set of networks

35
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,779
we will only<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on streaming and</font>

36
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,568
caching portions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network because</font>

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,909
well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we are our main focuses</font>

38
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:39,630
on and we will go over the caching and

39
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,399
the streaming not in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> order so this</font>

40
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,348
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what kind of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet looks like</font>

41
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:49,170
right you have the internets you have

42
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:53,670
the backbone riders you have like things

43
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">that connect to data centers so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

44
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">how the thing goes do they have a laser</font>

45
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:04,259
pointer system and this time I promise

46
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:07,949
not to huge muscles in my own eyes so

47
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:10,500
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the context in which we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

48
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,450
engineered and built our data centers so

49
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,510
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the spatial view of the network</font>

50
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,399
and while you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the scope and</font>

51
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,340
size of the network it's not as

52
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,400
interesting as this view which is

53
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,950
actually a utilization and time view of

54
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,100
the network this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is far more interesting</font>

55
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,420
from an engineering perspective this is

56
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,670
far more interesting from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

57
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,030
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective because you can</font>

58
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,670
see if you if you overlay the census

59
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,260
data from last year on to this this map

60
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,988
you will see that the vast majority of

61
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:47,160
the the user base so to speak is either

62
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:50,340
on the California side the left coast or

63
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,579
the right coast for the US and of course

64
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:59,910
certain major cities in Europe so you

65
00:02:53,579 --> 00:03:01,919
overlay your spatial build out where to

66
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,200
match the population centers so this is

67
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:09,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">a special you</font>

68
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:13,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">Layla corner anybody anyone else I'll me</font>

69
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,159
with your 30 million 10

70
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,720
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the spatial I mean</font>

71
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,400
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the utilization and the timing</font>

72
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,010
of the network this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is from a tool that</font>

73
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,100
is built by some of our internal tool

74
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,440
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> people they map various</font>

75
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,579
bandwidth utilization from the network

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">onto this graph so if you look look at</font>

77
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,380
the network you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see the red dots</font>

78
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,739
and the pinkish lines those represent

79
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:52,290
high bandwidth points in the network or

80
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,090
high bandwidth links in the network so

81
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,459
the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are trying to solve is to</font>

82
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:01,230
give the best user experience possible

83
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:02,910
with the minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of maintaining</font>

84
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,320
that service because that's the only way

85
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can survive you have to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

86
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,329
best experience at the minimum<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost so</font>

87
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,190
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the bandwidth we will</font>

88
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,340
look at the bandwidth as it proxim as a

89
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:16,019
proxy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost because if you run out of</font>

90
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,630
bandwidth you have to incrementally add

91
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,729
more circuits and they cost money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

92
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,590
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the latencies and I'm only</font>

93
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">showing a few of them because the rest</font>

94
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,330
are relevant you get the idea you're

95
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,700
looking at latency as a proxy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

96
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,430
user<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience people normally go</font>

97
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,050
online and expect it to be fast and for

98
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,930
some definition of fast with the many

99
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:40,470
definitions and that can for the first

100
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:44,460
order can be approximated by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTD the</font>

101
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:47,010
latency and the Jedi so this basically

102
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,440
this diagram here sets out our problem

103
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:52,140
space we want to minimize our costs and

104
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,130
provide the best user experience within

105
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,120
those parameters of course in 99 we just

106
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to provide the best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> user experience</font>

107
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,880
without regard<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cost unfortunately</font>

108
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:05,190
those days are long gone so then we look

109
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,890
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> our major</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peering points and those</font>

110
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,900
peering points normally jump out as

111
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,000
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want to push content</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

112
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,090
do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're looking at here is</font>

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,480
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people like FedEx Walmart</font>

114
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,260
amazon.com have been doing for years

115
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically what you're looking at is a</font>

116
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,270
large operations research problem in

117
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:26,280
optimizing your cost of goods

118
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:29,580
distributed and in this case we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

119
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,409
pushing parcels are we on our shipping

120
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,180
parcels<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Goods around</font>

121
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,440
internally we are just pushing packets

122
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,360
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same equations</font>

123
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,460
immigrations research principles can be

124
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,530
applied to the network so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

125
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network you will see certain and</font>

126
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:48,320
this is a very small multivariable

127
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,660
problem with we have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it in</font>

128
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,250
beautifully in some cases I mean this

129
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:56,420
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually very fairly small</font>

130
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,770
network if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in number of</font>

131
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,840
like the variables we have to optimize

132
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,250
for so most of the stuff we can do in

133
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,619
dutifully like this looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a good</font>

134
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,630
place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get approximately close</font>

135
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,580
to the correct answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sometimes we</font>

136
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:11,900
apply a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more research into it and</font>

137
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:15,050
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> optimize an effort based on that so</font>

138
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:17,120
basically the solution given given the

139
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,380
solution space now we have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

140
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,110
what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is you want to</font>

141
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,930
distribute the thing that costs us money

142
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:26,180
which is bits as close to the user as

143
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,460
possible this optimizes two things this

144
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,730
reduces our overall bits carried on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

145
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:34,760
network reducing costs and improves the

146
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:40,310
user experience leading to a better

147
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:43,690
service this isn't i'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point it</font>

148
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,690
away from me because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm gonna shot</font>

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,729
this one's better whoever it is like

150
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,539
catching afterwards other if I walk off

151
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:56,469
with it so what we're going to do is

152
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:58,990
we're going to distribute the right

153
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,699
content to the right place<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically try</font>

154
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,560
to take the content from our data

155
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:04,900
centers and push it out air force the

156
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,729
user as possible and using various

157
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,679
techniques such as content distribution

158
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:10,810
networks distributor diabetes and

159
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,819
distributed caches because caches

160
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,680
content I'm sorry our<font color="#CCCCCC"> webpages are</font>

161
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:16,870
content and things like we've developed

162
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,349
in-house like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ultravox and we'll go</font>

163
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:22,630
more into detail later and of course

164
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:25,150
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best place to put content</font>

165
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,580
cash it is on the users pc directly

166
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:30,280
because well you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> RTD is almost sarah</font>

167
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,320
and so with their things like AOL top

168
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,349
speed which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the products we</font>

169
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,060
sell which actually decide and do a much

170
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:40,090
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> cash in job on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user's pc then</font>

171
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:44,289
say the default program given to us web

172
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:46,090
bill so having said that this is what a

173
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:48,219
functional breakdown of an AOL data

174
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,049
center looks like keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

176
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,720
correct method views this is basically

177
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:57,340
functional<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will be focusing on the two</font>

178
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,699
red circles here which is basically

179
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:04,000
streaming networks and the web cache

180
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,930
networks each one of these little silos

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,370
here could take up an entire

182
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,000
presentation of like an hour what is

183
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,169
extremely interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and which</font>

184
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,380
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't have time to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

185
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:18,159
into today is the oscar boss complex the

00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:20,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">oscar boss complex supports aim and the</font>

189
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:27,849
actually stupendous unfortunately we

190
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:30,070
will not be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to those so</font>

191
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:32,770
basically data center design philosophy

192
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:36,819
the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> data center is in sourced so</font>

193
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:40,208
to speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> chris myself james on over here</font>

organization that

200
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,710
so we own it and when which has some

201
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,510
optimizations because now we can make

202
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:01,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the thing is done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right it has</font>

203
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,160
some problems in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if stuff breaks we</font>

204
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:07,640
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it ideally we want</font>

205
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:12,770
the responsibility without any any blame

206
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:14,900
but can't have it all so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the</font>

207
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,449
network is it looks like a fractal if

208
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:20,449
you would every component inside we try

209
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:24,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to like dual home have two of each and</font>

210
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:26,360
then the bats we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> written in pads</font>

211
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,310
and then at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top level we have</font>

212
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,250
redundant data center so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can lose any</font>

213
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,229
cluster and migrate the users either

214
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,800
transparently for example with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oscar</font>

215
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:40,670
boss are redirecting in DNS rotors for

216
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,689
other stuff into<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that is still</font>

217
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:47,089
up we were also<font color="#E5E5E5"> not big fan of vlans we</font>

218
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,760
are not a big fan of<font color="#CCCCCC"> VTB even a big fan</font>

219
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:51,530
of layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 networks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in general they tend</font>

220
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,410
to cause more problems than they solve

221
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:57,680
in our experience so we basically try to

222
00:09:54,410 --> 00:10:02,270
stick to layer 3 and above element as

223
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,709
possible is Richard<font color="#CCCCCC"> galella</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in here if</font>

224
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:07,880
it was you would have asked him<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

225
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:11,750
some of the ATM bridging stuff

226
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:14,000
and eventually we come to system review

227
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,260
this is a very important part of AOL we

228
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,360
go through the back<font color="#E5E5E5"> wall and go through</font>

229
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,830
data centers then we review our current

230
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,750
bandwidth utilization<font color="#CCCCCC"> czar current</font>

231
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,690
number counts and see what what would

232
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:25,160
happen if<font color="#E5E5E5"> X components failed we just</font>

233
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,990
normally look at the components and we

234
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,969
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a bunch of clusters out and</font>

235
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,190
see if you can map the remaining

236
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:35,090
capacity we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have available on to the</font>

237
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:38,080
demand so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what the data center</font>

238
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:40,730
cluster is another reason you look like

239
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,310
there is the reason the you can put them

240
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:44,840
up here there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing visible because</font>

241
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,180
to actually really see them you would

242
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,100
need a plotter sheet about the size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

243
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,829
the stable wide and what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> long so</font>

244
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can read what's on the on the things</font>

245
00:10:51,830 --> 00:11:00,230
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the context of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> naval data</font>

246
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:02,930
center<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if you take the data center</font>

247
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,570
cluster out we will only focus on on the

248
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">cash part which is this like Bob box</font>

249
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:10,420
over there and the streaming networks

250
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:13,760
some of the network's down below

251
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:16,339
represent the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oscar complexes would give</font>

252
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,670
you some idea of what what the network

253
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,670
looks like

254
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,690
so caching

255
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,230
so when able to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out</font>

256
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:31,929
um

257
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:40,699
the users were terminated on these

258
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,939
complexes like the dot complex the bots

259
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:46,579
and each one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems was</font>

260
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:48,800
designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support X number of users</font>

261
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:50,329
and of course exchanged as the capacity

262
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,969
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system degrees as we got better</font>

263
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:54,859
cpu better more horsepower in the boxes

264
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:59,089
the problem with this architecture was

265
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,860
that it was fixed so each switch each

266
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:02,869
cluster supported a fixed number of

267
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:07,009
users and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was you</font>

268
00:12:02,869 --> 00:12:09,050
can scale systems that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> running out</font>

269
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:11,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">of capacity now of course the simple</font>

270
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,699
answer is why don't we throw out some of

271
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:16,040
the safe example you ran<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of DNS why</font>

272
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:19,998
don't we throw out the DNS with boxes

273
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,529
and replace them with faster cpu which

274
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:23,019
is normally the approach you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

275
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:25,550
at from a theoretical perspective

276
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:27,290
unfortunately our financial planning

277
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:29,240
people would shoot us if we try to do

278
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,790
that because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have these cycles we</font>

279
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,829
have amortization schedule that we have

280
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,660
good here do so we just couldn't for

281
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:37,519
example throw out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of boxes and</font>

282
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,529
replace them the faster boxes so

283
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,899
basically whenever we had to build more

284
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:44,059
capacity<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a node so we</font>

285
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:46,220
built on the unit of maintenance the

286
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:48,170
unit of construction who support a user

287
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:52,490
or the node and so we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build that</font>

288
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:57,170
node out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the solution was via</font>

289
00:12:52,490 --> 00:13:00,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">couple each service from the fixed</font>

290
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:02,479
neural architecture into a farm<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

291
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:05,179
speed where you farm out different

292
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,439
services for example DNS forums caching

293
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:11,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">forums and as each cluster of each</font>

294
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:15,589
particular service ran out of capacity

295
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:17,779
you would just<font color="#E5E5E5"> add more hosts they're</font>

296
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:21,199
much much easier to do than trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

297
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:24,170
swap in these swap in flight a machine

00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:28,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">that Rodney's return so basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

299
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:31,599
decoupled a service growth from our

300
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:36,880
nodal architecture

301
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,880
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> font design so you have</font>

302
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:44,850
so you hit the farm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the web</font>

303
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,840
cache routers up top and each of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

304
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,700
little boxes now silos provide a service

305
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,280
and you can basically arbitrarily scale

306
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:56,340
each one of these in any dimension that

307
00:13:53,280 --> 00:14:00,420
you need in terms of CPU memory or or

308
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:04,920
space and I'll go more into detail and

309
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:06,750
secondary so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what the new web</font>

310
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,449
cache architecture looks like keep in

311
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:12,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind that this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a dot on the big</font>

312
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,550
green map that I showed earlier so you

313
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:18,480
have the ipd forms which are their

314
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:20,160
tunnels which terminate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user the</font>

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the slide in interests of disability so</font>

319
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,720
to speak but there's a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> cluster of</font>

320
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,480
these

321
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,750
these evil user comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> enter minutes on</font>

322
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:40,199
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these these forms and then they</font>

323
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:42,360
do these clusters provide the various

324
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,829
services that we need and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font>

325
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">have some of the ia people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here who</font>

326
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:47,870
actually run the

327
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,070
the hosts over here and that they do is

328
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,170
killing stuff

329
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,330
so all in all this cluster here serves

330
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,329
about 13 billion requested<font color="#CCCCCC"> damage in the</font>

343

then load balance there is a virtual dns

switches you send a request to the farm

350
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:47,300
switches and there's force things like

351

layer formatting reverse and forward

354
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:57,349
so you make a request to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS form</font>

355

switches the dns van switches will load

366
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:29,719
trying this out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this actually leads</font>

367
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:31,429
to such an even load distribution that

368
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,739
if you look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one of our graphing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">duels you cannot tell that each server</font>

370
00:16:33,739 --> 00:16:37,129
from one server from the other because

371
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,799
all the lines are coincident upon each

372
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:43,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">other this is almost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred-percent the</font>

373
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:46,399
only grail of load balancing so now of

374
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:47,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">course billions of DNS requests coming</font>

375
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,110
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> ALB</font>

376
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,450
they all get served across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS farms</font>

377
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:55,510
and keep in mind this is a question

378
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:58,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are many other clusters like it</font>

379
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,380
this one is mine

380
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:06,159
people caught that reference

381
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:08,370
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> some day so that then does the dns</font>

382
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,370
server

383
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,950
of course the same technique is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

384
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:16,980
applied to modulo like stateful things

385
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:18,660
like DCP across web caching and so

386
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically now we can scale any of these</font>

387
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,610
in arbitrary dimensions that we require

388
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:26,060
now streaming data scattering let's take

389
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:28,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">a look at streaming on streaming a</font>

spread<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out to the content</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> you locks</font>

410
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,059
so basically the you box is a set of is

a set of protocols set of hardware and

want to go

414
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:39,820
so the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> is couldn't do whatever</font>

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,420
I just put the<font color="#CCCCCC"> N saw the nullsoft video</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">life content servers</font>

430
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:17,649
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what the cluster looks like</font>

431
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:19,479
this is a mini data center in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chicago</font>

optimization for time and optimization

434
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,510
for bandwidth you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

435
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,860
then you push it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the edges where</font>

00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,330
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> midget</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peering points are and if you</font>

437
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,120
look back up your slides you'll see

438
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,919
Chicago<font color="#E5E5E5"> community appearing buttons so</font>

439
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,149
you have a to the end you have fears

440
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,150
coming off these riders

441
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,919
you have a router there we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> ultravox</font>

442
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,199
which at this point consists<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

443
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,240
specialized hardware which fetches

444
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,450
content and then does the unicast

445
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,980
replication split I wonder if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

446
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:54,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">admirers here no we are not going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

447
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,930
multi gas first and nullsoft video this

448
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,120
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Death Star complex so for example</font>

449
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:01,460
if you click on CNN you want to see a

450
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:04,678
video<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a news collect</font>

451
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:07,800
that is so awful

452
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,750
the Death Star complexes

453
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,700
this over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and we'll go and do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

454
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:15,740
in more detail is the unified storage

455
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,740
complex which consists of some arrays

456
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:22,170
the systems that push content into the

457
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:25,139
race there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fiber</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> channel I over IP</font>

458
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:28,020
replication across to the west coast<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

459
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,340
then you have the same information

460
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,379
happening there so basically they're

461
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,270
synchronized over fcip so we have

462
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,440
encoders on both coasts that company

463
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:37,200
line to the repository<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

464
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,110
magically synced across either either

465
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">coast so this is what a unified storage</font>

466
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,889
complex looks like

467
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,330
some magical method of getting data into

468
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,450
the

469
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:56,809
repository the repository is then

470
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:59,539
sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> across to the other repositories</font>

471
00:20:56,809 --> 00:21:02,059
and when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that star people</font>

472
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:04,100
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ultravox one content somebody goes</font>

473
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:06,860
and joins example in one wants to watch

474
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:10,570
a video clip they will do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> death</font>

475
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:13,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">star the death star then does a benefice</font>

476
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:16,559
load balance to request to one of these

477
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,629
servers which is everyone

478
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,149
and then the closest one and then you

479
00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:22,740
dump<font color="#E5E5E5"> it dump that clip over to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Death</font>

480
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:25,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">Star and then the Death Star rep sends</font>

481
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,879
it out to the user so what what this

482
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,158
means is that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

483
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:31,439
speeches and<font color="#CCCCCC"> want and video clips</font>

484
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:34,679
trailers that people want to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

485
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,710
would if we unicast let them<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

486
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:41,100
data centers would take up terabytes of

487
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:44,129
bandwidth now we only send out one then

488
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:47,009
copies and replicate them 100 200 200

489
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:50,870
thousand times at ugh this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a huge</font>

490
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:52,610
huge gain on a statistical model

491
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,439
then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's things like live</font>

492
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,059
content which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> always painful to do no</font>

493
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,360
matter where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are this has never been</font>

494
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:58,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">easy</font>

495
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,860
so we have this thing called the

496
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,989
broadcast operations center

497
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,370
so a lot of life content is encoded<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

498
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bak and then you send it out to the</font>

499
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:10,929
unified complexes and then within the

500
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:13,150
unified complexes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

501
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:15,520
some kind of multicast they should make

502
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:18,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">waves slightly happy and the multicast</font>

503
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,400
is only act to act as a transport<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs</font>

504
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,710
within the data center it never leaves

505
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,810
the cluster of hosts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

506
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:28,570
connected

507
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:30,250
for example let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the large news</font>

508
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">corporation this is not CNN by the way</font>

509
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:35,480
just so

510
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:37,610
each the news corporation encodes their

511
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,279
data to send it out in two or three bit

512
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:42,949
rates just using<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here and then put</font>

513
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:45,259
it to the transmitters here we go so

514
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:48,440
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a large new site they encode</font>

515
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:50,419
their their content send it over the

516
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,999
backbone into these light transmitters

517
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:55,340
these live transmitters collate and then

518
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:57,019
send that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> distributed</font>

519
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,509
streaming on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> unified storage</font>

520
00:22:57,019 --> 00:23:03,270
complexes which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> distributed around</font>

521
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:05,310
there around the background

522
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:09,980
and then of course those couldnt

523
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,980
depository and then out out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the end</font>

524
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:16,420
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what the box looks like are</font>

525
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,419
we doing of dungeon

526
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,210
hurry about

527
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,629
I

528
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:28,340
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bar looks like and</font>

529
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,900
again the problem with this is that the

530
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,730
density of

531
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,500
mission high enough that we really can

532
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,860
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything so just have to go by what</font>

533
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,860
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> stayed</font>

534
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:41,779
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these hosts doing coding is</font>

535
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:44,059
monitoring so you wanted the video

536
00:23:41,779 --> 00:23:45,500
streams you monitor the encoders you put

537
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:47,420
stuff into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

538
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,710
unified storage complexes and then you

539
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,870
push it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there so this is</font>

540
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:54,190
basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nerve centers so to speak</font>

541
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,189
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrows really complex</font>

542
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:00,460
so any questions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> before this sounds</font>

543
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:03,750
like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oscar screech I would really like</font>

544
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:06,520
to say this is a very large and very

545
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:08,530
complex operation no single person or

546
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,590
even single group of people can do this

547
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:12,790
so some of these people are here I would

548
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">really like to thank them some of these</font>

549
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">are actually here this james watson</font>

550
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,370
Derek Watson Terry raise your hands

551
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,480
these are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the engineers that</font>

552
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:23,199
work on this and make this a reality

553
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:25,540
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a major pain to operate run and</font>

554
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,920
design flaw and this a lot of hard work

555
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,710
that goes into the slightly give my

556
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,340
thanks

557
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:32,809
and yesterday while<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually most of our</font>

AOL party the sorry we were handing out

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,659
those USB key thingies you'll never<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

people and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

one of the person of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the group replied</font>

567
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:56,130
oh they must be the marketing guys so

568
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,420
for you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not sales and</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll end with the final quote which</font>

572
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:08,540
I promised the Amazon guys on the show

573

questions

574
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,980
howdy

575
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,470
what issues did you have with

576
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">authentication so what issues did you</font>

577
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:21,760
have a pathetic

578
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:24,750
start cashing streams of

579
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,750
with sites that

580
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,590
yes there are

581
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:34,080
I'm not like you go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

582
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:35,968
extremely complicated really actually

583
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">have tended asian issues we have solved</font>

584

them I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if I'm allowed to say</font>

585
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:42,230
because I didn't go into that what

586
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:45,110
exactly we

587
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:46,909
some that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is IP that we are we have</font>

588
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:49,248
surrounded by by legal

589
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:51,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's a number that seems like one</font>

590
00:25:49,249 --> 00:25:54,000
of the trip

591
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,370
I mean like actually let me give you a

592
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,140
little hint of some stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I was</font>

593
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,949
saying that there's all kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reverse</font>

594
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,630
netting

595
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,519
and forward nothing happening here in

596
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:06,440
life you deform switches

597
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,729
are you familiar with the AOL concept of

598
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,909
da hah which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dynamic design</font>

599
00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:12,950
hotels<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay basically when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you connect</font>

600
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:14,419
you get to IP address as you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your IP</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">address on their ass when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you dialogue</font>

602
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:17,239
and then when you connect to the year

603
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,219
old service and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> attenti gate you</font>

604
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:22,459
also get another IP address inside the

00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:28,668
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> the daha the tunnel into the ipt</font>

609
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:32,839
protocols and then expose ib and then

610
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:36,168
they use the data to do the

611
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:38,479
authentication inside the complex the

612
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:40,309
problem with that is that the request

613
00:26:38,479 --> 00:26:42,139
came in from the advanced IP address

614
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:43,639
you're operating on the da hah now you

615
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:45,918
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maintain a mapping between the</font>

616
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:47,988
<font color="#CCCCCC">rass IP address in the da hah and that</font>

617
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,770
is some of the the tricky IP property

618
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:52,300
that is is fenced around by

619
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,879
because unfortunately I kind of moved

620
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,950
back

621
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oh Spencer Dawkins you were talking</font>

622
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:01,670
about using<font color="#E5E5E5"> multicast within</font>

623
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,470
I gotta Sooners yeah is that like

624
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:05,770
I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just curious what kind of what</font>

625
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,770
kind of

626
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:12,050
basically it's it's very small really

627
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,220
this on

628
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,389
the multicast itself

629
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:29,330
not that large women

630
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,500
saves us<font color="#E5E5E5"> from having to replicate</font>

631
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:34,610
of thousands

632
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,610
screams all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> engines</font>

633
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:43,000
essentially a multicast is the data bus

634
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,928
the data transport was inside the thing

635
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,970
if you really want to know about

636
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:47,149
multicast diversity started with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazon</font>
