00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
hi boy last time I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> at nanog was</font>

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:10,740
probably about five years ago or so no

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,750
wait actually I was in Oakland but this

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,820
has gotten much bigger than I remember

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,890
back in the early<font color="#CCCCCC"> days when we met in</font>

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,070
the Bay Area it was probably about one

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,359
third or maybe 16 the size anyway I

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,820
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about good engineering</font>

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,789
practices regarding wireless because I

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,010
have seen a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of ISPs</font>

11
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,130
decide to go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the search</font>

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,770
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wireless business to try to</font>

13
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,329
circumvent the last mile<font color="#E5E5E5"> that usually</font>

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">the corporate monopolies has a hold of</font>

15
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:45,040
like various cable companies and in

16
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:48,328
telephone<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies but excuse me my</font>

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:53,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mac decides to</font>

18
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,449
I get down in on here

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seems to be a lot of</font>

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,820
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> clueless but there's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

21
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,710
much RF clue fulness that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing</font>

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,779
deployed and because of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:19,410
deciding<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a lot of unlicensed</font>

24
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:22,080
spectrum where things tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

25
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:24,240
somewhat more anarchistic than licensed

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,380
spectrum and because of that there's a

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,940
lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> stepping on each other's</font>

28
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,530
toes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to talk about good</font>

29
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,820
engineering practice to be able to

30
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:35,700
ensure better up time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

31
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:38,550
as well as other people's networks to

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,930
prevent interference and such so next

33
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,310
slide I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about good</font>

34
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,310
engineering practices which is

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,370
30

36
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:54,570
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> called star office on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac</font>

37
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay stander is a good engineering</font>

38
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,070
practice that used to be a term that the

39
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,420
FCC actually pre previous for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FCC</font>

40
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,829
which is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the federal radio</font>

41
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">commission used and eventually morphed</font>

42
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,940
into the FCC's rules and regulations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

43
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,150
not sure why it's freaking out like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

44
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,150
go back

45
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,879
to that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually currently</font>

46
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,340
meant as kind of a set of standards or

47
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,629
as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> proper way of doing things to</font>

48
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,819
cheer more uptight and minimize

49
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:30,470
interference to yourself and to other

50
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:33,380
people so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are using as i</font>

51
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,180
mentioned 802 11 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

52
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,910
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the upsides and downsides of</font>

53
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,310
that and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> how this works a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

54
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,890
engineering practice obviously the

55
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,260
biggest reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's non-licensed the</font>

56
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:50,109
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that is that it's</font>

57
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,109
significantly less regulatory oh man

58
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,400
hassle that you have to be able to do to

59
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,530
be able to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> these boxes up you don't</font>

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,140
have to no expense of licenses and

61
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,060
coordination the arcane regulatory

62
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,399
knowledge need to license radio is not

63
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,470
needed and what I mean expensive

64
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,930
expensive license<font color="#CCCCCC"> and coordination by</font>

65
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,959
the way that can end up being like tens

66
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,489
or maybe at least single digits single

67
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,840
thousands of dollars or tens of

68
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:17,599
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars sometimes for</font>

69
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,700
coordination and search for license the

70
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,638
hardware costs is magnitudes less than

71
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,010
the equipment lysis technology if you

72
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:29,209
had a standard sort of carrier-class

73
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:32,410
radio this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why we have max come up</font>

74
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:41,960
here beforehand to test it out

75
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:43,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I need them even less okay so carry</font>

76
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,100
a class radio' may cost tens of

77
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,510
thousands of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars whereas you can go</font>

78
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,190
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get an access point for fifty</font>

79
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:57,380
dollars or so doesn't this assignment

80
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:59,690
for outdoors obviously getting 11 254

81
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,820
megabits will and reality is actually

82
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,980
something about half of that is a big

83
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:08,420
win over those old wireless radios that

84
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:10,459
only did 19 to this is going to be

85
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,730
frustrating i can tell after about 45

86
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,730
minutes

87
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,750
um

88
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,238
I don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's in the</font>

89
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:26,280
Darwin x-mode because I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

90
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:27,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">staroffice obviously 802 11 is a little</font>

91
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,159
bit more plug and play because it's

92
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:32,009
based on ethernet standards and actually

93
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,560
the software pretty much any modern

94
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:36,780
operating system can support it why not

95
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,009
use 802 11 well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is where we're</font>

96
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to start getting into it the</font>

97
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:42,539
biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason is it's non-licensed</font>

98
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">non-existent coordination facilities</font>

99
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:45,719
there are couple companies or

100
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:48,750
organizations are trying to put organ

116
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,888
they get really upset when you started

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,349
interfering with them they're called

118
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">Public Safety and they use it for things</font>

119
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:35,940
like video between helicopters and the

120
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,610
ground and such and if you interfere

121
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,979
with them they tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to they tend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

other issues besides that well the

124
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,069
biggest thing for unlicensed is that you

125
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,650
have no priorities over any other

126
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:55,800
traffic if you go into the FCC rules and

127
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:58,049
regulations in part 15 dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 it says</font>

operations of an unintentional or

incidental radiator subject to the

131
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:06,620
conditions that no harmful interference

132
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:06,620
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to have</font>

133
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,960
which I knew this my heart is caused and

134
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:19,469
that interference must be accepted and

135
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,469
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be caused by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

136
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,810
I can copy this up in us being you do

137
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,810
that

138
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:35,440
basically you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no rights Oh can we</font>

139
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,440
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use yours okay</font>

140
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:39,930
exact same<font color="#E5E5E5"> boss</font>

141
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,100
it's

142
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,580
you have it in mirrored mode

143
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,940
take up most of my time just playing

144
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,940
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Macintoshes</font>

145
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,990
so anyway you have no rights over any

146
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,120
other users of the band and particularly

147
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,280
you don't have any rights over licensed

usually people complaining about you

deploying these things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course</font>

179
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,140
there's various local ordinances on

antenna deployment and such building an

expensive network on 8211 or unlicensed

182
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,200
can be used a risky as you have no

183
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,660
rights or priorities and you may sink a

184

189
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:08,330
like FCC rules changes are pressures to

get the FCC to enforce rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> the active</font>

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:16,340
hopefully changing the FCC's rules so

195
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:25,520
talk a little bit about good engineering

practices for RF deployment basically

197
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,490
from point A to point B is what you're

198
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,630
trying to do you're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a</font>

00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,709
engineering practices will only put

talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some deals so there's kind of</font>

213
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,960
like two vectors you have to work with

214
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">in designing an RF like one is the power</font>

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,650
again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to cover that turf</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much it for every deployment</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">about engineering the lane antenna</font>

going to be doing for short distances

247
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,150
you could pretty much sort of look and

248
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,560
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it so i can</font>

249
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,870
tell that i can probably get to that

that out there's a bunch of software out

actually show details on a free<font color="#E5E5E5"> one here</font>

EDX makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really nice software package</font>

and software<font color="#E5E5E5"> modeling package but</font>

262
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">unfortunately it cause like tens of</font>

thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars if you're doing a</font>

264
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,180

<font color="#CCCCCC">EDX would be a good solution something a</font>

267
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:02,720
little bit cheaper company by a name and

268
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,339
path loss puts out for about 4 grand if

269
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,930
you're doing sort of like if you're a

270

standards or ISP and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to make</font>

sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get your backbones</font>

272
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,450
working at such I would you probably

273
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,519
invest in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

274
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,860
really cheap it's actually free there's

275
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,470
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company as a package out there called</font>

276
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,240
radium<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile which actually kind of is</font>

277
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,100
actually in some ways it's more accurate

278
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,529
than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> others because it actually uses</font>

279
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:30,079
the shuttle RF elevation modeling that

280
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:32,060
they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> about three or four years ago</font>

281
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,339
and so it's actually accurate to about

282
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:37,279
one meter for elevation and terrain and

283
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:39,829
such but the more you pay the more

284
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,959
accurate<font color="#E5E5E5"> app time and coverage</font>

285
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:43,640
predictions you can get what they do is

286
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:46,279
the more expensive ones have better

287
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,930
knobs for for tuning adjustments like

288
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,820
weather and things like that and they

289
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,899

291
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:58,970
bit longer and and actually it reflects

292
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,070
reality a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better you also</font>

295
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,160
do you see in nearby if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going up</font>

297
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,560
for things like eng antennas or

00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,269
electronic news gathering they tend to

299
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,910
use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same frequencies you will be</font>

tend to interfere<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you very nicely</font>

302
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:23,750
in fact we're already starting to hear

316

about that later but those would be

things like buildings a plane of water

engineering software to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the</font>

343
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,120
question is you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be asking</font>

344
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,040
that software can the antenna see each

other and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into this a</font>

346
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,269
little bit later do objects cut into the

00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:03,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">furnell zones and again we'll talk about</font>

348
00:15:00,269 --> 00:15:06,690
that in later<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides what's the free</font>

349
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:08,550
space path loss what's the prediction

354
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:22,019
link budget and path loss for that you

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,910
have actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> two things you have to</font>

00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:26,069
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just a simple mathematic</font>

357
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,569
formula to figure out if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

358
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:30,630
have enough signal from point A to point

359
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:32,880
B you're going to have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of gain in</font>

360
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,230
certain things like antennas you'll have

361
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,380
gained in the transmitter and receiver

362
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,940
amplifiers and maybe in and and you also

363
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,370
have gained effectively in the

364
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,730
your output you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have loss and things</font>

365
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:47,280
like coax connectors what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

366
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:50,520
called free space loss which is the the

367
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:53,069
loss between one antenna and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

368
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:57,390
antenna which ends up being at least 96

369
00:15:53,070 --> 00:16:01,890
TV and then whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> mileage that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

370
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:03,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have between those two you're</font>

371
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also have obstructions into</font>

372
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:08,610
that will cause diffraction which will

373
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually cause attenuation as well and</font>

374
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,620
then atmospherics notice how much rain

375
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,510
do you have how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> snow at 2.4 it</font>

376
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,040
doesn't really become a factor but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

377
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,660
you're starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use like the 60</font>

379
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:24,540
problem this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a simplified sort of</font>

380
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,400
schematic of what what gain and loss

381
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,339
you're going to have for instance at the

382
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,590
transmitter you have there you're going

383
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,390
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain amount of gain you</font>

384
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,220
have free space loss between those two

00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:37,199
antennas again you know gain in the

<font color="#E5E5E5">antenna loss in the transmission</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> line</font>

train coax a lot of game in the antenna

395

a lot of loss in the path and some gain

396

in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the receiving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> antenna and then a</font>

little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of loss in the coax pit and</font>

398
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:10,540
hopefully the receiver can receive this

called the fade margin which is the end

411

result what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know fate margin</font>

412
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:42,129
is the the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of signal over what</font>

the receiver needs to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to receive</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the signal and typically for longer</font>

415
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,200
links you want to hire a fade margin

416
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,700
because you know that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

have a more variety or very more varied

you're going to have like with

420

throughout mysterious and such it may

421
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,409
actually attenuate a little bit more

442
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,620
compensate for that the refraction will

443
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,979
actually bend the signal up and down as

444
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:57,159
it gets to the receive end so if you

445
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,600
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very tight beam with antenna you</font>

may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put multiple antennas there</font>

to be able to cover it<font color="#E5E5E5"> marine layers</font>

448
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,280
will actually do this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

449
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:09,169
if you have a hot<font color="#E5E5E5"> and cold sort of layer</font>

450
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,620
that'll come in it will actually bend

451
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:15,290
the signal as well we're also going to

452
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:20,659
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fornell zones furnell zone is</font>

a circle or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a zone that will go around</font>

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,850
without significant attenuation

458
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,160
typically you'll need there's a

459
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,290
calculation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you a little bit</font>

460
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,420
later but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to clear at least</font>

461
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">sixty percent of what's called the first</font>

462
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,930

463
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,510
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vernell zone but sixty percent is</font>

464
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:46,430
a good rule of thumb<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can tell at</font>

465
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,290
this schematic that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four nails on</font>

467
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:52,760
and then and thence gets skinny on the

468
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:55,880
ends here so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance if you have a</font>

469
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,920
building that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> say in the middle of</font>

470
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,750
here that cuts into this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vernell zone</font>

471
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:04,130
then you can expect a significant amount

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:05,810
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten uation at the receive end that</font>

00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,220
same spreadsheet that i told you about

474
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:09,950
also will do throw nails own

475
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,650
calculations and all they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do is</font>

476
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,490
put in the miles how far out the

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,980
figure out how far or how wide<font color="#CCCCCC"> the four</font>

480
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:24,020
this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said there's we have a path</font>

481
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,720
that's five miles<font color="#E5E5E5"> long about halfway</font>

482
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,190
through the path about 2.5 miles we want

483
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,340
to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what how wide the furnell zone</font>

484
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:32,930
is and the first the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vernell zone</font>

485
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:35,780
is about 50 feet at that point so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

486
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:38,300
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be at least that that much</font>

487
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:41,960
clearance in the middle of here's an

488
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:44,240
example of why it's a factor and this is

489
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:48,410
a path that I did for an Indian

490
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">Reservation up in and North Dakota where</font>

491
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,130
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get from point A to</font>

492
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,900
point B the receive antennas the

493
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,880
transmit antennas are actually on towers

494
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,280
that's why they look up there above that

495
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,560
ground we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the two</font>

496
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,840
locations that red line but you'll

497
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,879
notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the blue line which is afrin</font>

500
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">is actually not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good candidate what</font>

501
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:13,610
we'd have to do is actually raise or

502
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:15,080
lower this is me raise one antenna or

503
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,678
both antennas to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to clear that</font>

504
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fornells up</font>

505
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:23,100
i also want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about multipath</font>

506
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:24,509
multipath is typically done but you you

507
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,248
encounter that in fact you'll hear this

508
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:28,409
like on FM radio when you're going

509
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:29,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">through like downtown or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

510
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:32,820
that you'll hear this whap whap whap

511
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:35,119
whap sound and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is two</font>

512
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:38,220
signals arriving<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your receiver at</font>

513
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:40,019
different times typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll have a</font>

514
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,909
direct path which will come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

515
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:45,059
transmitter to your receiver and then

516
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:46,889
you'll have some radio frequency that

517
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:49,499
make bounce off of building and then get

518
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:50,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">to your receive location but because it</font>

519
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:52,139
has to bounce off to some of the

520
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:54,178
building gets you it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a</font>

521
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:55,469
longer path to get to you and therefore

522
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,990
it's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly out of phase</font>

523
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,519
in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could be hundred degree 180</font>

524
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:03,419
degrees out of phase and therefore

525
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,590
cancel out the other signal so typically

526
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:06,840
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to consider</font>

527
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:10,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have buildings next to you and</font>

528
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to be concerned about multiple</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">whereas a signal may bounce out that</font>

line receive signal the way to get

532
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,710
around that is typically is have a very

533
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:25,710
narrow beam with antenna to hopefully

534
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:28,860
ignore or attenuate signals that may be

535
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,869
coming off access you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also address</font>

536
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,129
it by using antennas with different

537
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:34,980
polarizations and going to talk about

538
00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:36,570
antennas in a second to other

539
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,100
interference issues are there other

540
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,139
users on the band you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,580
coordinate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people or you can</font>

542
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:45,240
change frequencies or you can do a

a little bit i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you the</font>

how many clients can you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> your access</font>

of signal strength can the clients

553
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:10,320
expect the typically the way that you do

00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:12,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is through kind of an elaborate</font>

555
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,059
form of what what would be known as ray

00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:55,488
meadow these methods so they're actually

572
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:59,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little bit more accurate again this is</font>

at for your clients around their

different antennas for the different

00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,629
usually going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an omnidirectional</font>

discouraged because its spectrum

610
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:27,619
the other direction where your clients

611
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:30,340
are so in the case of point-to-point you

612
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:32,418
may use a directional in both ends

613
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:34,668
point-to-multipoint for instance your

614
00:25:32,419 --> 00:25:38,720
typical little laptop card uses what's

615
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:41,460
called a dipole and that's actually that

616
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,919
is actually a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PC</font>

that's usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> etched on this on the on</font>

618
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,200
the edge of the pcmcia card has very low

619
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,720
gain radiates in almost all directions

620
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,220
equally well or equally badly depending

621
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,690
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point of view it's a an</font>

622
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,120
omnidirectional antenna will usually

623
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,130
have games at some degree and what they

624
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,649
do by that is a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of antenna</font>

625
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:06,870
theory is how you have gained is you

626
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:08,939
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> energy that you'd normally</font>

627
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,500
be going in all direction and you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

628
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,659
squeeze it down and focus it out

629
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,120
someplace else so think of a flashlight

630
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:17,610
when you have a flashlight when you have

631
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,199
it unfocused and the beam is really

632
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:21,389
spread<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of a dim beam but as</font>

633
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,890
you focus the beam where it is actually

634
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,480
becomes more and more narrow that

635
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,770
becomes a brighter and brighter you've

636
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,159
actually increased the gain in that

637
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:30,960
direction so an omnidirectional will can

638
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,130
have gained by taking the energy that

639
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be going to straight up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

640
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,690
straight down and squeezing out towards

<font color="#E5E5E5">the horizon other antennas you'll be</font>

642
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:41,279
looking at as panels or sectors where

643
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:42,779
what will happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> is those are good and</font>

644

652
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:01,500
but you may want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cover about 90</font>

653
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,230
degrees this way so that's typically

654
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,000
what you see is a panel or a sector

655
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:08,039
here's a here's some polar plots for an

659

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see on the bottom it's it's</font>

660
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,169
pretty much a circular pattern<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if</font>

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,330
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the top which is the edge on</font>

662
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:24,870
you can see some horizontal gain where

663
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:26,189
it's not producing any energy up or down

664
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:29,549
but it's pushing out towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the horizon</font>

665
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:32,190
there this is a panel or a sector

666
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:35,250
antenna you'll see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gain again</font>

667
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,510
this is edge on on the top or that's

668
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,870
kind of like that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking at</font>

670

<font color="#E5E5E5">the horizon but if you look from the top</font>

40 50 degrees there directional antennas

00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:54,419
do not radiate in all directions again

675
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,700
this is hence the name directional

677
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,690
the more focus the antennas the higher

<font color="#E5E5E5">want to sort of mention it really</font>

00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:06,290
quickly is because there was some

interest by a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple people here where</font>

00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,770
there like for instance we want to do

00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:21,689
qos you usually won't find

796
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:28,980
we're actually rolling our own another

can look at on the slides or you can

look at the barn side other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware</font>

considerations a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

801
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,670
decided to use amplifiers to sort of

00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:42,360
power through their problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a</font>

803
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:44,610
good idea and a bad idea usually it's a

00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:46,320
good idea if you if you can't explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

805
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:49,679
for any other reasons from getting point

necessarily just to buy these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font>

mix<font color="#E5E5E5"> and match them between antennas and</font>

copper ground in a common point which

861
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:54,339
means usually large copper stakes in the

868
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:09,370
this is a what's called the gas

this a little circle right about here

it does is it's kind of like a neon bulb

875

after a certain voltage it actually

876

there's things like mesh which will

00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:18,100
that is taking image taking 802 11

991
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:19,930
devices and since they get hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> watts</font>

992
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,779
as opposed to us which we only get one

993
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:24,580
watt<font color="#CCCCCC"> tpo they're starting to put use</font>

994
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,350
this the same equipment but

995
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,790
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're kind of restricted</font>

996
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,610
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of con what kind of</font>

997
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:33,070
content<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can put over these networks</font>

998
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:35,620
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> firme answered us I was meaning</font>

999
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:38,530
to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> about frequency shifting devices</font>

1000
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:41,790
like kinds of amplifiers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will also</font>

1001
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:45,570
ship shift from like 2.4 up to 3.5 or

1002
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:49,270
whatever right only that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good point</font>

1003
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:54,150
three point there's we're starting to

1004
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:56,110
see more equipment out of 3.5 tsunami as

1005
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:59,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">proxima starting to make some stuff out</font>

1006
00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:01,600
there you can there's you can use

1007
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,020
transverse and such to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move</font>

1008
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,299
that

1009
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:07,930
up to move common equipment like a 2.4

1010
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:10,600
to up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 3.5 or 5.8 down to 3.5 if you</font>

1011
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:11,620
want to as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't played with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1012
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,290
that much I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what the</font>

1013
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:19,390
legalities of that is so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1014
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:21,490
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that further yeah Charlie Conant</font>

1015
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:23,680
from Next Web I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say first of</font>

1016
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:26,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">all it's a great presentation secondly I</font>

1017
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,790
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the key points to really</font>

1018
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:30,610
note here is the frequency coordination

1019
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:32,050
as you pointed out bank is really

1020
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,390
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> in for those of you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1021
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:36,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">a bank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it is the broadband access</font>

1022
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:39,220
network coordination group in<font color="#E5E5E5"> California</font>

1023
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we have a mailing list that you can</font>

1024
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:45,399
join up for at www<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bank calm and you can</font>

1025
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,800
all sign up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see what other</font>

1026
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,500
wireless ISPs are doing and get

1027
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,470
frequency information for the various

1028
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:56,110
sites that we have deployed there so

1029
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:58,419
thanks yeah thanks I'm glad to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> bank</font>

1030
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:59,170
out there at least I the only problem

1031
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,630
with these sort of frequency

1032
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:03,310
coordinations is and maybe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1033
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:07,120
address this to some degree is how do

1034
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:09,040
you with at least with license users you

1035
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:12,130
take away the license if somebody does

1036
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,509
something bad with with unlicensed you

1037
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:15,190
have to sort of like use peer pressure

1038
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:17,650
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be interesting to see</font>

1039
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:19,060
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to how unlicensed</font>

1040
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:23,140
frequency coordination groups are going

1041
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:25,420
to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so anyway just a quick take</font>

1042
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:27,129
away try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use only the turf in</font>

1043
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,870
spectrum you need coordinate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with other</font>

1044
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:30,730
users and tell them how to coordinate

1045
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:32,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">with you and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also once you mention</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1046
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:35,050
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12-15 there's going to be a</font>

1047
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:37,689
wireless ball that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be down in</font>

1048
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:39,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">the foyer or whatever we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right after</font>

1049
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:40,930
the reception area where we're going to

1050
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:43,359
try to compare notes if anybody has

1051
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:46,500
further interest on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thanks again</font>

1052
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we can wrap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up now</font>
