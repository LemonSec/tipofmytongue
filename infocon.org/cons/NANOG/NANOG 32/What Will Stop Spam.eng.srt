00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:06,180
first of all thanks for letting me come

2
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,360
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk just a little bit</font>

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,899
about new email identity technologies

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:19,198
will they stop spam and if not then what

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:24,029
will stop spam basically email identity

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:28,340
technologies allow us hey terrific here

7
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,340
yeah that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fine thank you</font>

8
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:34,890
they do provide some assurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,739
domain we're receiving email from is in

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,239
fact allowed to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> email to us</font>

11
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:43,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies like Citibank can authorize</font>

12
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:46,559
the use of their name to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending mail</font>

13
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:50,640
it doesn't protect us from companies

14

like CIT one<font color="#CCCCCC"> bank.com it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also allows us</font>

15

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,100

17
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,440
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a balance spam if you're not</font>

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar with bounce spam they send a</font>

24
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,729
it will allow us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> analyze the</font>

responsibility of the owners it's kind

26
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like a credit scoring system it</font>

27
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,979
allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to look at what each domain is</font>

sending how many complaints are

154
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,800
what's coming off<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our network folks</font>

155
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:45,830
it's a real<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye opener it's not always</font>

156
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:50,410
something we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see but that's</font>

where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to go thank you</font>

158
00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:03,300
questions yeah hello two quick questions

159
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,710
are the first you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most of</font>

160
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,590
the spam you're saying is coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

161
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:10,890
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs mail servers which seems</font>

162
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:14,520
reasonable does that mean effectively

163
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:16,740
that all other ISPs overall I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spees need</font>

164
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,890
to stop smart hosting I mean have we

165
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:23,660
reached the<font color="#CCCCCC"> euro where is PS need to</font>

166
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:26,760
stop accepting mail kind of from anyone

167
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,750
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MTA's we really</font>

168
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,550
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just accept responsibility</font>

169
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,130
anybody that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to send through our</font>

170
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,349
MTA we're ultimately responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

171
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,260
we can enforce good authentication then

172
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:38,880
we're good to go if as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP you want</font>

173
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,630
to allow anybody to send anything off of

174
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,770
your ISP then you need to be aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

175
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,110
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be responsible for it</font>

176
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:48,840
and ultimately we're going to end up in

177
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">a kind of credit type system where based</font>

178
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,890
upon the amount of spam that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

179
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,970
network generates you're gonna that's

180
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,470
going to determine whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not your</font>

181
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,580
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are able to send mail and you</font>

182
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,490
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad credit score</font>

183
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:01,710
winning when it boils down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it so do</font>

184
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think a reasonable thing for isps to</font>

185
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,720
do is to require smtp on from all of

186
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,609
their subscribers and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet you know</font>

187
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,460
it does that allow enough of feedback

188
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,140
mechanism to help fix this problem I

189
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,020
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's an end-all</font>

190
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,790
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it but I do think it's a</font>

191
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,710
good idea I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of like</font>

192
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:23,339
locking the front door it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

193
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:25,830
keep the hardened criminal out but it is

194
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to provide some degree of safety</font>

195
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:34,680
and I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first step thank</font>

196
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:36,480
you this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> on yeah you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> described</font>

197
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,839
something that sounds dangerously close

198
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,880
to settlement based spamming<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I'm going</font>

199
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,470
to tolerate a certain volume of messages

200
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,580
from me as<font color="#E5E5E5"> long as you tolerate a</font>

201
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:49,200
certain volume of messages or vice versa

202
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,690
and that sounds like a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> dangerous</font>

203
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,870
road to

204
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,420
go down be honest are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you referring to</font>

205
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:58,580
the feedback loop system yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I</font>

206
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,770
mean what we do with the feedback loop

207
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,720
system is when we get a piece of email

208
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:04,490
that's reported as spam it's come from

209
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">your network we want to forward it</font>

210
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,050
whether it's forwarded to an automated

211
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:11,870
process that processes those complaints

212
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,240
whether it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sums up or tallies up</font>

213
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:17,360
the complaints from certain IP addresses

214
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,820
or perhaps it segregates a based on

215
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,590
customer we want you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be aware of</font>

216
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,210
what's coming off of your network how

217
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,440
you deal with it is completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to you</font>

218
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,640
we've had a lot of companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

219
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,080
to us afterwards and said how do you

220
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,460
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to deal with these you know</font>

221
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,710
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got these complaints what do we do</font>

222
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,320
with them I don't know do what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

223
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:34,400
with them it's coming off your network

224
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,930
and ultimately you're going to be held

225
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,670
responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it what's the</font>

226
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,800
appropriate<font color="#E5E5E5"> action for you to take is it</font>

227
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,599
to block that customer are they on a

228
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,709
static IP address do you go and contact

229
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,920
them and let them know that they're

230
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:48,170
compromised<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know one isp started</font>

231
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,089
taking those reports and using it to

232
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,699
disallow access to their customers and

233
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:54,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">had a phone bank that left a message on</font>

00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,550
their answering machines or contacting

them at home and told them that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they had</font>

a compromise machine that they needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

237
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:02,540
get the vaio off or malware off their

242
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:18,190
show you what it is and let you deal

243
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:18,190
with it however you see fit the waiters

244
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,350
the way your system works now basically

245
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,300
it sends<font color="#CCCCCC"> you an email when you've</font>

246
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,740
reached a certain amount of pass the

247
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,079
threshold I think it's one percent

248
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,510
wouldn't it be smart to allow people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

249
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,140
track what the percentage of complaints

250
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:36,520
is or it becomes a problem absolutely I

251
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,230
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're referring to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

252
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,449
report card system report card is

253
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,090
another process that we have that when

254
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,140
you exceed a certain percentage of

255
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:46,300
complaints based upon the amount of mail

256
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,400
you said or when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> exceed a certain</font>

257
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,900
bounce percentage we will send you an

258
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,630
automated report card the following day

259
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,510
to say by the way here's what your hosts

260
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">are or your network did yesterday</font>

261
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,720
feedback loop system is a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

262
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,850
different and it does provide exactly

263
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,010
what you're telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me or asking for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

264
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,140
that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-time feed of what's</font>

265
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:07,420
coming off your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network a lot of people</font>

266
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">use that as a gauge to determine when</font>

267
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,810
they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and they can watch</font>

268
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,520
network spikes they'll see these

269
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,140
complaints come in and go wow you know

270
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,760
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really weird getting all these</font>

271
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,560
complaints at the same time I'm losing

272
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,670
bandwidth you know what what's the

273
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,500
what's correlation here and they go back

274
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:26,290
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look and sure enough they have a new</font>

275
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,970
set of zombies on their network well the

276
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,180
specific problem that i'm talking about

277
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:33,130
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have many customers that send a</font>

278
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:37,000
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mail and I run hosting company</font>

279
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:38,680
and we we receive a feedback loop email

280
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,170
but it's very difficult to correlate

281
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,270
what's necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> published because of</font>

282
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,459
the volume of the of the email that gets

283
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:48,579
sent to us it's a lot of information to

284
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know to figure out what's happening</font>

285
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,610
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

286
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,140
and I mean if there is a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at</font>

287
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,810

problem AOL actually does an awful lot

294
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,940
on metrics and we look at spam

303
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,520
stop spam reaching our customers they're

304
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,640
not so worried about spam reaching your

305
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,779
customers that's your problem to that we

306
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,550
say well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what if we give you</font>

the help what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start telling you</font>

308
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,810
where your problems are sounds

309
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,980
ridiculous that we would do something

310
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,630
like that because we all manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

311
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,370
networks and yet we would allow a third

312
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,620
party to come and tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us but a lot of</font>

313
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are asking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for it now they want a</font>

list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of IP addresses that are</font>

315
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,510
compromised at any given time they also

316
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,040
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what their spam complaint</font>

317
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,740
rate is or what their mail delivery

318
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,209
volume is at any point in time and

319
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,910
that's something I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you'll see</font>

320
00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:05,810
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very near future thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank</font>

321
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:14,569
you thank you thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>

322
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:18,349
everybody sure it's our next<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaker</font>

323
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:20,390
here sorry little late anything that AOL

324
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:22,820
is doing to improve their users from

325
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:27,560
using the spam button as the delete

326
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:32,209
button well you know it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

327
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:33,979
easy to educate 30 million consumers but

328
00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:36,469
we do have to take that into

329
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,390
consideration certainly if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get an</font>

330
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,800
email that's reported as spam you don't

331
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,240
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about your network being</font>

332
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:45,010
blocked unless you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

333
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:48,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">other issues lack of reverse DNS or</font>

334
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:52,339
credit history if you will that speaks

335
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:53,779
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself so other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than that there's</font>

336
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:56,640
not a whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do to</font>

337
00:14:53,779 --> 00:15:00,670
educate somebody

338
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:02,830
real quickly does the webform take cider

339
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,360
based addresses the example doesn't make

340
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,520
it look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does you know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

341
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it does so there is a comment</font>

342
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">section and believe it or not somebody</font>

343
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,130
actually does look at these got a team

344
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,810
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet services</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it</font>

345
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:16,210
ultimately reaches my team which is a

346
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,439
postmaster team and they do look at

347
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,150
these and determine whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

348
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,470
they're appropriate if you actually have

349
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,959
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> site arrange that you need to put in</font>

350
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:25,540
there we'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

351
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,130
often times though we find that site or

352
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,230
ranges aren't really necessary I mean

353
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:31,270
how many male hosts outbound mail hosts

354
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,800
does any one company really need I mean

355
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:40,290
for our 30 million subscribers we're

356
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:40,290
looking at 2030 thank you again
