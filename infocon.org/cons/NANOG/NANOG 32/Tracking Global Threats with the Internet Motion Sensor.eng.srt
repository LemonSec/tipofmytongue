00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:04,680
so hi my name is Michael Bailey I'm with

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the University of Michigan I'm up here</font>

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,740
with Timothy battles from<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and today</font>

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're to talk a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">internet motion sensor project so I</font>

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,179
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're all going to be terribly</font>

7
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,710
terribly surprised to understand that

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,940
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a bunch of really nasty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,920
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet today like denial of</font>

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,119
service worms I think it'd probably be

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,289
equally surprised that somebody

12
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,698
somewhere thought that that was a good

13
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,949
monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> project how does IMS do is</font>

14
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,210
monitoring as the saying goes all the

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">good ideas in computer science for</font>

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably not true for this one but</font>

18
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,350
pretty darn close we do what you guys

19
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,300
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing for a while</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is we</font>

20
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,129
use the routing infrastructure to

21
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,140
offload packets from the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

22
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,269
analyze them of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you have an</font>

23
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,469
OC 192 backbone the problem becomes one

24
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,079
of trying to figure out what it is that

25
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want to upload to analyze</font>

26
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,870
fortunately there's a couple situations

27
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,129
in which we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some pretty clear</font>

28
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,480
indicators that something's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going wrong</font>

29
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,489
and there's some clear indicators of

30
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,050
what to pull off this includes attacked

31
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:01,019
customer trackit traffic in the case of

32
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,510
DNS traffic outbound to space that's not

33
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,619
allocated and stuff inbound<font color="#CCCCCC"> to parts of</font>

34
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,350
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network that actually don't have</font>

35
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,869
host in them we like to look at the

36
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,669
inbound traffic to unused address space

37
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,650
part of the reason we<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to do that is</font>

38
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,210
that the traffic itself is pre-filtered

39
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,979
because there's no host in that address

40
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,570
space we shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be seeing traffic in</font>

41
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,610
the traffic we do see is because

42
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,080
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> is scanning there's worm</font>

43
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,380
propagation there's misconfigurations

44
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,429
there's backscatter so if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

45
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,020
starting to sound familiar it should

46
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,729
there's been a lot of really good work

47
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,589
by folks in this room in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this area</font>

48
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,429
including the the work by the folks that

early lunch well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's a</font>

52
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,220
couple interesting things about this

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular project and they derived</font>

54
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,000
directly from the design goals of the

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,560
system<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet motion sensor</font>

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,439
project was designed to do four things

57
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,930
based off of some of our experience

58
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,429
doing early monitoring of this type in

59
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,509
particular what we wanted to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is be</font>

60
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to differentiate services</font>

62
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,159
ports which already carry a lot of

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,649
traffic in this face of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all</font>

64
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,149
not all the new exploits and

vulnerabilities happen imports<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

66

<font color="#E5E5E5">already know so we want to be able to</font>

67
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,709
capture those as well

68
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,120
in addition to which we want to have

69
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,680
broad representative coverage of

70
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,209
whatever start<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is that we do see and</font>

71
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,530
finally we want the system to be

72
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:18,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">available if it's going to provide any</font>

utility during these times of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new worms</font>

74
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,090
or threats so why don't we care about

<font color="#CCCCCC">differentiating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> services as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pointed</font>

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,239

during this week you can probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess</font>

88
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,629
where it came out if you had known that

piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information might have been</font>

90
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,069
harder to do it's not until you spend

91
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,510
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> time looking at what the infections</font>

92
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:59,458
are trying to do as we do in the upper

left hand right hand corner excuse me

94
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:05,879
that you can actually see that there's a

signal within that noise why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

102

based on what network you're in what

time of day it is what the fashion of

104

the day is in this particular case we're

105
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:32,970
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a graph of big changes in</font>

108

scanning for the backdoors traded by

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,450
these worms so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we didn't capture</font>

117
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,530
information on these ports if we didn't

00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a monitoring infrastructure that</font>

119
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,859

information obviously a broad coverage

122
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,799
is in great part about getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> as many</font>

123
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,120
sensors as you can the more space that

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,310
you have the broader the coverage the

125
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,989
earlier the time to detection the better

obviously is the large difference the

problem because we don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

190
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,620
what the application

191
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,070
exploit is until we actually initiate

192
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,050
the three-way handshake so our solution

193
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,520
to this is to build a lightweight active

194
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,650
responder to get the first data packet

195
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,479
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> solution is pretty simple we get a</font>

196
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,919
sin we sin a kit and that's generally

197
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,320
enough to get enough of the payload to

198
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,240
differentiate the threats so how does

199
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,460
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> look list let's look at this in the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">what you would see if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were TCP</font>

223
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,260
very into blaster it's a denial of

224
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,890
service attack payload and then tell it

225
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:47,030
to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> execute it and hit so what</font>

226
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,400
does this look like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the context of</font>

227
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">IMS well again as we mentioned earlier</font>

228
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,400
what we're trying to do is illicit

229
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,440
enough of the payload to differentiate

230
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,380
various threats in the case of blaster

231
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,690
you can see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IMS or black hole sensor</font>

232
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,520
or supplying the syn<font color="#E5E5E5"> ack that's enough</font>

233
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:04,400
information for us to elicit the RPC

234
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,659
bind as well as the RPC request we can

235
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,830
notice that the section<font color="#E5E5E5"> teardown stuff</font>

236
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,960
is not there because we don't store

237
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,280
state we just reply with the syn<font color="#E5E5E5"> ack</font>

238
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,659
we're not trying to do full session

239
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,429
reconstruction and that's part of the

240
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,169
reason to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scale it's also the</font>

241
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,760
case that with<font color="#CCCCCC"> respect to blaster</font>

242
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:21,260
there's no real check to see whether or

243
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:24,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the the exploit actually took effect</font>

244
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:26,270
so immediately following its<font color="#E5E5E5"> a buffer</font>

245
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,460
overflow packet being sent it goes ahead

246
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:30,349
and tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to connect on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 444 if you</font>

247
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,659
respond on that port you also<font color="#CCCCCC"> are able</font>

248
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,010
to differentiate and get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little get a</font>

249
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,750
hold of the payloads as well as the

250
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,340
commands

251
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,140
so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the problems with this</font>

252
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,000
particular approach is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you start</font>

253
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">listening more payloads you have more</font>

254
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,960
payloads to store and we saw a drastic

255
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,200
increase in the amount of stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

256
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,850
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> storing on disk one of the first</font>

257
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,190
solutions we try to this was hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font>

258
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,110
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> store new stuff and the way we did</font>

259
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,700
that was we took an md5 hash the payload

260
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,520
and only store palos or to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a unique</font>

261
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,350
ash one of the cool things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen</font>

262
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,579
as a result of looking at that was we

263
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,560
pretty much found that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

264
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,210
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first application</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> halo across all</font>

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,530
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see that most of them have</font>

267
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,699

268
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,260
large percentage almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety-five</font>

00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent in this particular graph you're</font>

00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,040

272
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,969
of five months so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know why is this</font>

273
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,410
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful and why do we care</font>

274
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:27,020
hopefully folks here will remember the

275
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:30,170
SAS earned a burr worms of earlier made

276
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:34,280
this year<font color="#CCCCCC"> sasser was an LSA SS</font>

285
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,780
it actually exploited a vulnerability in

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:59,990

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,050
exploded to her ability in the ftp

291
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,990

notice in the previous slides the spikes

305

the size of the humps is similar each

have some equipment that we can set out

you'd like what you get when you

00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,930
show me yours I'll show you mine kind of

397
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,030
attitude you get aggregate views across

00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:14,050
little bit about why this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful in</font>

403
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:15,760
an operator context so I get the real

so what's the importance

407
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:37,200
alright so what's the importance I mean

408
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:38,880
most most importantly we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have we have</font>

409
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,810
early detection for the worms and

410
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,430
viruses second we can provide the source

411
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:47,640
addresses that are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit these</font>

412
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,170
at these these dark address spaces we

413
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,780
can provide these lists to our abuse

414
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">groups for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cleanup pretty much anything</font>

415
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:55,709
that's hitting dark address space is

416
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:58,469
going to be some type<font color="#CCCCCC"> of malicious</font>

417
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:02,490
variant or scanning or it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed</font>

418
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:05,700
to be there it provides bass lines on

419
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:07,260
footprint measurements one of the things

420
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,760
we do is there's a lot of complaints

421
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:10,830
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> white noise that's going</font>

422
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,590
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet so we have</font>

423
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,540

424
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,850
or have it or some rather large blocks

425
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,069
and we can cut a baseline what we

426
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,350
receive on our are dark address space

427
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,810
and we can go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer we can say</font>

428
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:27,120
well you know one hundred percent of

429
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:28,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">your bandwidth out of that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know five</font>

430
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,560
percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is being allocated to</font>

431
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,540
just just internet noise you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know let's</font>

432
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,400
do a footprint reduction so that you can

433
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,400
you can recoup some of that cost

434
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:51,800
so why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need payload one it enables</font>

435
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,270
the detection of new variants if we're

436
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">not looking at the payload if we're not</font>

00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:58,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at the signatures if you're just</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">relying on something hitting port 80 or</font>

439
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,520
something hitting port 98 98 how are you

440
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever going to know if there's a new</font>

441
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:08,689
variant are you know the typical dark

442
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:11,140
address space it isn't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

444
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,770
unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can pick up on some type of</font>

445
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,990
payload and we can be found murdered by

446
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:22,400
an entirely new variant not even knowing

447
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:25,070
it can be used to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDF signatures</font>

448
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,040
if if a new variant does get released

449
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,990
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quick method that we can</font>

450
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,230
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that signature and we can rapidly</font>

collecting source AAS distributions we

464

can say where's the thread our most of

these sources are they coming from Asia

where to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start placing our access list</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how do we really need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

478
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,600
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> this question if our data is a</font>

00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,340
is absolutely it does us no<font color="#E5E5E5"> good unless</font>

481
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,830
something to say but why did this happen

482
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,020
but if we're going to prevent outages

483
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:07,040
from operational standpoint we need to

484
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:10,310
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-time data and so bringing it</font>

485
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,780
all together this is kind of a more of

486
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:15,200
an eye chart I don't know if you guys

487
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:19,580
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it entirely but essentially you</font>

488
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,650
can operationalize this if you're

489
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,720
monitoring something from ims you can

490
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:26,000
determine whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a new</font>

the old variant see if it's increasing

494
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:35,210
see what source is is it's coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

495
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:37,760
sudden the sourcils is up to the abuse

496
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:41,450
to us for cleanup if it is an invariant

497
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,580
we can go into mitigation and from that

498
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,980
mitigation we can determine what's the

499
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:49,760
severity of it is this is this a little

500
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:52,400
eyes just to my ISP or is this global is

501
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:57,590
this hitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these other blocks I</font>

notify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proper people we can do</font>

firewall updates we can do ids updates

00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:14,140
update perimeter filters activate Tar

507
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,139
Pits based on that

vendor updates contact a vendor because

509
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,200
we have the payload we can immediately

510
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,180
send that off to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor see if they</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">already have a nun patch and patch it</font>

512
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:51,228
sit thank you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you you guys can't</font>

513
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:52,849
sit down because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question so</font>

514
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:54,349
yeah if there are any questions please

515
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:56,330
stand up quickly so that I can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

516
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:59,178
good count because I'm hungry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I want</font>

517
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:03,529
to leave for<font color="#CCCCCC"> lunch have I been counted</font>

518
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:05,779
yet no you are invisible<font color="#E5E5E5"> here on any</font>

519
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:10,460
cast instance of the bill protocol so

520
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:14,029
you once<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm gonna one you guys can take</font>

521
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,529
this sitting down though a question

522
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:18,320
about the ims project is there any

523
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:22,159
reason why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dedicate a</font>

524
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:27,109
whole subnet to it or is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing all</font>

525
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:30,139
of the if instead of black<font color="#E5E5E5"> holing a</font>

526
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:32,478
cover route for our announced prefixes

527
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:33,830
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just send them all to one place so</font>

528
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:36,649
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a more specific</font>

529
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:40,960
for we send past your box is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

530
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:40,959
enough yeah yeah
