00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,509
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today is challenges</font>

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,769
of deploying things into the internet

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,230
what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking about goes</font>

7
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,880
somewhat beyond the usual preoccupation

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,470
with the technology I'm really concerned

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the economics and the policy</font>

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:32,399
aspects of trying to get things out

17
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,680
for myself and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> other point that i</font>

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,929
like to make up front is that you know

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,640
what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a more</font>

20
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,519
activist role but it certainly isn't

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,660
about regulating the internet so keep

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,699
cool equal gang ok now for me I'm some

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,580
particularly motivated to look at a set

24
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,048
of issues in part because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the work</font>

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,880
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do that relates to cybersecurity</font>

26
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,549
I am a member of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Homeland Security</font>

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Policy Council for the FCC it's been an</font>

28
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,159
interesting line over the years and not

29
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,658
long ago the president's office the

30
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,790
White House was concerned with creating

31
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,930
a national strategy to secure cyberspace

32
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,159
and there were a couple of features that

33
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">they identified as being important ones</font>

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,090
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep an eye on and one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these was</font>

35
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:36,030
enhancements DNS security and another

36
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:39,180
was bgp both operational kind of

37
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,210
processes and also things more like

38
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,829
secure bgp they kind of flag those as

39
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,059
issues there's a third where I think

40
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were perhaps a little off the mark</font>

41
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,689
and where they realize later that they

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,790
were bit off the mark and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

43
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,990
they also identified ipv6 which I think

44
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,060
most of us would recognize is

45
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,619
tangentially related

46
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,579
security but security probably isn't the

47
00:01:54,619 --> 00:02:01,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason why you didn't commit v6 so there</font>

48
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:04,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">are these capabilities all of these in</font>

49
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:07,939
various forms have been slow to deploy

50
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,739
into the market<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got me thinking</font>

51
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:11,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it actually got me thinking about a</font>

52
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:14,230
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> other things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in various ways</font>

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,010
have been slow to deploy into the market

54
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,420
differentiated service has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been fine</font>

55
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">within a network but across providers</font>

56
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">has been slow to deploy into the market</font>

57
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,738
one might even<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the same point about</font>

58
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,359
multicast now one can<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue you know</font>

59
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:27,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe not all of these are great things</font>

60
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">but some of them are probably good</font>

61
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:33,799
things and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> natural question is why</font>

62
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,410
is it that this particular bunch of

63
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:39,140
features seems to have been well maybe

64
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,599
not stall but moving at a glacial pace

65
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,220
slow pace you know what's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

66
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,730
what are the elements of commonalities

67
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,260
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> its telling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us and from that</font>

68
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,760
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> really toss out a couple of thought</font>

69
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,959
questions and these are largely the

70
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,048
things I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on in the</font>

71
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,209
course of the presentation first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

72
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:58,790
course my common factors be working here

73
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:00,500
among these various capabilities that

74
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,000
the second one and again we start

75
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">reaching pretty quickly into the areas</font>

of economics rather than technology is

77
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,709
our market forces enough to drive these

78
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:11,180
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> into widespread deployment are</font>

they nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> general to ensure that</font>

80
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:20,239
vital enhancements happen and if not is

00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,160
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to correctly identify some</font>

to provide help to it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I emphasize</font>

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the word correctly are we smart enough</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that right which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

87
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:37,519
rhetorical question having settled that

88
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,290
what kinds of public policy initiatives

89
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,819
might be available<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> foster deployment</font>

90
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,010
of things that might not get going on

their own what are the costs and

92
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,679
benefits what are the prospects of

93
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,450
success for

94
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,799
that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of intervention these are</font>

95
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,469
basically the questions I'm looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

96
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,450
pose today and I'll be I think throwing

97
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:54,829
out more questions than answers but in a

98
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,200
way I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to start some dialogues</font>

99
00:03:54,829 --> 00:04:01,760
both in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this community and also within</font>

100
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,310
government itself now there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

101
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,170
underlying economic theory to this in

102
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:09,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular there's one notion of public</font>

103
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:11,510
goods and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> from economist com</font>

104
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,760
it's a fairly technical definition of

105
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,828
public goods are but the things like for

106
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,139
example the national<font color="#CCCCCC"> defense system and</font>

107
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:19,699
a national defense system is such that

108
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:22,580
the country has to have it benefits

109
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:24,530
everybody if it weren't supported

110
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,500
through taxes it would be hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

111
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,359
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay for it because if I don't</font>

112
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">pay for it I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that my neighbor</font>

113
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,430
probably has to there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough</font>

114
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:36,530
penalties for slacking it's classic

115
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,960
economic problem and as a result

116
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,940
services like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually government</font>

117
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,609
plays some role in ensuring that they're

118
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:48,139
provided now there are several documents

119

that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be drawing on in the</font>

120
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,710
discussion that follows and a couple of

121
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:54,080
them are quite new documents one is a

140
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,508
so basically what are the economic

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,008
incentives to the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have to</font>

make investments in order to get these

143
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:47,300
things out are the economic incentive

144
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,669
sufficient to motivate people to do the

145
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,550
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are needed are they aligned</font>

146
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:54,260
that is the the benefits from those

147
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,230
investments flow back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

148
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,640
make the investments are those benefits

149
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,720
quantifiable if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font>

00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,840
business case they better be

151
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,540
quantifiable<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do they come back in a</font>

152
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,950
reasonable time frame to other topics

<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going to be touching honor the</font>

154
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,810
economics of network externalities and

155
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:14,180
also the relationship between the

156
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:18,230
end-to-end principle and something that

157
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,850
economists call transaction costs so

158
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,140
let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about economic incentives</font>

159
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,300
well again with many of the features

00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,460
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're talking about if we ask</font>

161
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,930
ourselves who pays is at the end user is

162
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,409
it the service provider a lot of cases

163
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:33,050
it's the service provider who<font color="#E5E5E5"> benefits</font>

164
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,970
in many<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases it's really the society at</font>

benefits think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about something like DNS</font>

168
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,380
SEC does the individual provider

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,370
actually get the benefits or is it

170
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:48,320
everybody basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the parties that</font>

171
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,630
have to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dough in don't see where</font>

00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:55,909
move the thing forward a third issue has

174
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,900
to do once again with quantify ability

175
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:02,690
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> timeframes if there's a long payback</font>

176
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,460
period again even a prudent business may

177
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,410
not be motivated to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the investments</font>

178
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:10,010
just too speculative it's just too

179
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,300
problematic you remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> Louis Quinze so</font>

180
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,460
maybe it was his mistress Madame de

should ask for me the flood and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

won't happen while it's on my watch you

process of creating the<font color="#E5E5E5"> National</font>

00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,020
had the opportunity speeds of them for a

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">few minutes and I said well you know</font>

204

guys if you have trouble getting

business<font color="#E5E5E5"> plans together that your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">us know we think this is important and</font>

basically says you know Scott<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have</font>

the answer everything in these reports

business cases that our management would

time ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I take that as a data point</font>

219
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,530
it's one data point the single swallow

220

does not a summer make but it's a data

221
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:42,600
point and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it becomes important</font>

222
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,660
to focus on the economics of these

issues now a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people have</font>

looked at this and as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said there are</font>

225
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,400
different reasons why<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,060
made this rather nice but perhaps or

231
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,739
heavily economic assessment that under

232
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,869
investment occurs because conditions

233
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,150
exist that prevent firms from fully

00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,770
realizing or appropriating benefits

235
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,990
created by their investments in other

236
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,329
words if a company can't get the full

237
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,370
benefit of the money it puts in it'll

238
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,140
tend to under invest if it doesn't know

239
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:24,390
where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> money is coming out it won't</font>

240
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:27,240
put enough money<font color="#E5E5E5"> in now another major</font>

241
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:30,420
area is the economics of network

242
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,920
externalities and there's an extensive

243
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,810
theory on this in fact a lot of the

244
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,240
theory<font color="#CCCCCC"> was developed by a guy who used</font>

245
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,790
to be at Bell Labs Jeff Rolf's he's a

246
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,680
wonderful economist I gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the title</font>

247
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a recent book he did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bandwagon</font>

248
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,199
effects in high-technology industries

249
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:49,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a great little book it's a fine</font>

250
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,030
read you don't have to be an economist

251
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,260
to get a lot out of it it's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> book</font>

252
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:56,910
it's a great way to understand these

253
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:58,260
problems so basically in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

254
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,990
industry there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some features that</font>

255
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:03,649
are worth a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more as more people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

256
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,449
them telephones are worth more

257
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:06,889
as more<font color="#CCCCCC"> people use them every time</font>

258
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:08,359
somebody in Montana who didn't

259
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:10,550
previously have a telephone by the

260
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,079
telephone<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes my telephone in</font>

261
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,209
Washington more valuable because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

262
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,160
one more person I can call the more

263
00:10:14,209 --> 00:10:18,680
people that have email service the more

264
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,368
valuable email is to everybody module of

265
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:26,420
the stammers so so that's what network

266
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:28,339
externalities are about now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

267
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,290
theory also tells us though is that the

268
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:32,779
optimal<font color="#CCCCCC"> value for the society</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

269
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:36,290
big big big rollout you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

270
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:38,269
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff and in fact most of</font>

271
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,069
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems have many potentially</font>

272
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:42,379
stable equilibria they can settle in

273
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:44,959
have a much lower level inside the

274
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:47,660
optimal one and so the question is how

275
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,839
do you get a new technology past<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

276
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,309
initial adoption humph how do you get it

277
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the point where it has critical mass</font>

278
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:55,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">and turns out historically different</font>

279
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:59,029
industries have met this problem in

280
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:01,249
different ways for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example with the</font>

281
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:02,869
telephone of one of the mechanisms that

282
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:04,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">was used is something called Universal</font>

283
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:06,559
Services cross subsidies to rural areas

284
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:08,599
to make sure that poor and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

285
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,779
are a long way from us in central office

286
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,429
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front system still get service</font>

287
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:15,170
for VCR is part of what happened was

288
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:17,480
that there already were a lot of

289
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">machines out there for time shifting of</font>

290
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,439
television programs that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> created</font>

291
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:23,959
the preconditions that made it possible

292
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:26,480
for the real<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry a VCR rental</font>

293
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:28,189
industry to take off there's a third

294
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,300
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> with CD players the way that it</font>

295
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:31,429
happened was that there were vertical

296
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:33,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">integration of industries the same</font>

297
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:35,540
companies like Philips<font color="#E5E5E5"> and matsushita</font>

298
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,740
that made players also had relationships

299
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,079
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> studio so they could get the</font>

300
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,309
profits on both sides of the market so

301
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:43,099
again it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> different in different</font>

302
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:44,990
places as a last example in the case of

303
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">black-and-white TV probably one of the</font>

304
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,179
biggest factors is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> industry and</font>

305
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:50,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">the government very quickly converged on</font>

306
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:54,009
standards and the standards were

307
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:54,009
acceptable and workable

308
00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:01,089
and well sir let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me skip through this</font>

309
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:03,699
again and another Department of Commerce

310
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:06,600
economic statement about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevance</font>

311
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:09,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">of externalities in this case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to ipv6</font>

312
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,019
now let's talk to the end-to-end

313
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:12,759
principle because it's yet another thing

314
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:14,379
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think plays into this mix I think</font>

315
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:16,029
plays into the mix for all of the

316
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:20,229
features<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we were talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about in</font>

317
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:21,639
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> second slide a while back and again</font>

318
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:23,169
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in this room I don't have to</font>

319
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:25,660
dwell on the technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody knows</font>

320
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:27,009
this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's guiding principle of</font>

321
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet architecture it goes back a</font>

322
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:32,169
long way sort of the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> seminal paper</font>

323
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:35,319
is really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Clarks ulcer and read</font>

324
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:36,789
paper from MIT<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> early 1980s and</font>

325
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:38,439
this has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been an important feature a</font>

326
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,699
part of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says is that there's</font>

327
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:41,738
some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are best and most</font>

328
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:43,839
appropriately implemented in n systems

329
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:47,169
and it's kind of a corollary to that

330
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,970
it's made it easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> features at</font>

331
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:50,649
the application level because they only

332
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,499
touch<font color="#CCCCCC"> the edges of the network they</font>

333
00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:55,239
don't touch<font color="#E5E5E5"> the core we know that we've</font>

334
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:56,799
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a similar beneficial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> principle down</font>

335
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:59,559
at the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> link layer which is you can</font>

336
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,509
add new data link types Wi-Fi let's say

337
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:03,608
to an existing network structure without

338
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:05,139
perturbing or disrupting the rest of the

339
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:06,999
network infrastructure so it's been easy

340
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:07,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">to add certain kinds of things to the</font>

341
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:11,859
internet that's been one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the great</font>

342
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:14,949
strengths the question here would be and

343
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:18,579
what about new capabilities that don't

344
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:21,279
fit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mold for example a service like</font>

345
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:23,049
ipv6 goes to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network layer isn't so</font>

346
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,480
easy to introduce just between<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pair of</font>

347
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:27,009
consenting adults many of the other

348
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,279
features that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're talking about really</font>

349
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:31,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">relate again to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> core kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of facilities</font>

350
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:34,629
that require a lot of entities to

351
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,749
participate and those are going to be

352
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:38,889
tougher requirements for

353
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:41,350
interoperability and upward

354
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:43,449
compatibility more complex the effect of

355
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,859
the network externalities are greater

356
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:46,929
again this notion that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

357
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:50,649
much value until almost everybody is

358
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:53,350
deployed but last but not<font color="#CCCCCC"> least the fact</font>

359
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:55,299
that you've got many players and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

360
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,680
long value chains means that you'll tend

361
00:13:55,299 --> 00:14:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have</font>

362
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">high economic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transaction costs now</font>

363
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,660
transaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost is kind of interesting</font>

364
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:08,520
term out of economics if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you buy a house</font>

365
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,250
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you're paying for the</font>

366
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,660
house you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mortgage let's say you</font>

367
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,990
know what your monthly payment is on the

368
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,880
mortgage but well how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people here</font>

369
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,640
what a house in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years show</font>

370
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,279
hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

371
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,699
around what I'm about to say when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

372
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:28,380
that you end up may be paying points you

373
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,660
end up paying a brokerage fee if you're

374
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,189
selling you end up paying a title

375
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,140
company you end up getting nickeled and

376
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,510
done with a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things</font>

377
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,339
those are transaction costs if the

378
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:41,430
transaction costs get high enough a

379
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,839
transaction may not take place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

380
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,540
the suggestion here is that there's a

381
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,029
whole class of potential upgrades to the

382
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,219
internet that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> held up or they're</font>

383
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:52,740
slow to deploy at least in part because

384
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,380
they tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have high transaction costs</font>

385
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,850
because you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get concurrence from</font>

386
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,459
such a large number of participants

387
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,690
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pairwise like like the</font>

388
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:04,439
original implementation of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

389
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:06,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">wide web now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about a</font>

390
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,910
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of specific vulnerabilities a</font>

391
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,290
couple of specific features here but I'm

392
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,540
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to dwell on the</font>

393
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology first the technology</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

394
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,630
isn't my point and second there's lots

395
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,000
of people here that are much more

396
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:20,850
current much more knowledgeable details

397
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,380
of the technologies than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just think</font>

398
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,510
what is I'm painting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

399
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,360
gestalt here to show you where I'm

400
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:30,050
coming from so again let's talk about

401
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,940
the domain name and particularly about

402
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,199
capabilities like DNS SEC well we know

403
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,570
the vulnerabilities I mean aside from

404
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,920
denial of service attacks you've got the

405
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,470
basic fact that you really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

406
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,150
who's answering back in an unsecured DNS

407
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,110
query you don't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it your data is</font>

408
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,240
good you don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hasn't been</font>

409
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,680
corrupted on the fly you don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

410
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,230
was good even in the server that sent it

411
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,430
to you first<font color="#E5E5E5"> place so this has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

412
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,630
known for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's why</font>

413
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,989
you've had different kinds of

414
00:15:51,630 --> 00:16:01,800
merge to try to address it to notable

415
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:03,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones are TC and RFC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 25-35 DNS SEC now T</font>

416
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,180
sig is designed for kind of a more point

417
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,920
mission a more limited mission you got

418
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,020
secret key cryptography you're getting a

419
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">cryptographic hash or checksum it</font>

420
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,160
authenticates the sending system

421
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:16,170
verifies transmission integrity so it

422
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,209
does a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> job or rather narrow job</font>

423
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,680
but does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> narrow job well it's not</font>

424
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,240
necessarily scalable to the whole world

425
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">it doesn't solve every problem it</font>

426
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't show your beard but what it does</font>

427
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:28,260
it does you look conversely at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font>

428
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,750
like DNS SEC was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very beautiful</font>

429
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,430
elegant comprehensive system now you

433
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,510
honestly that's below level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of detail</font>

and interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in talking to today the</font>

435
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:45,480
point is you got a very comprehensive

elegant system mostly workable deals

437

well on the address front we know what

479
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:26,360
happened this is the way that an address

480
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,370
usage graph would have looked up until

481
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,840
about nineteen ninety-one exponential

482
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,600
growth the addresses did indeed look

483

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were about to exhaust the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the same slide that I put up at nanog a</font>

488
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,960
subsequently due to what you could

489
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,320
really view as a rationing system put in

490
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,460
place by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rirs and a successful one</font>

491
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,710
you now have a negative second

492
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,510
derivative the rate of growth is slowed

493
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,560
to the point where it's much less as an

494
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:59,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue where there's not an immediate</font>

00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:02,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">threat of exhaustion so as a result that</font>

496
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:06,139
driver went away right so on the address

497
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:08,360
side the registries were successful in

498
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:11,120
checking the growth as a result you've

499
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">got a not compelling economic case today</font>

500
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:18,199
I would argue if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

501
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:19,970
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> yep Zig qos now again you get you</font>

502
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,410
know maybe some arguments for deployment

503
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:26,180
but not a compelling economic case today

504
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:29,060
so again they seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fall into the</font>

505
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,340
category of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because a lot of</font>

a lot of players if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about ipv6</font>

509
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,110
it impacts the equipment many of them

512
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,590
the rirs themselves there's a lot of

<font color="#E5E5E5">people there's a lot of moving parts of</font>

the system like this lots of moving

00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,370
parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> implies high transaction</font>

516
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:53,200
high transaction cost means difficult to

00:19:51,370 --> 00:20:00,129
get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> king rolling down there's to</font>

518
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:01,660
choose and also the benefits of

519
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,680
migration tend to be limited until

520
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,230
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:10,450
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I believe this whole class</font>

00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:15,070
of capability tends to be hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:20,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">raise the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there a role for</font>

some banana land well hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm from the</font>

527
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,040
government i'm here to help right but

528
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:27,040
you know is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there a role for somebody to</font>

529
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,899
try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process moving and that's</font>

530
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,409
a lot of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was actually writing the</font>

531
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,920
paper on now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's an area</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

532
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:37,840
needs to be dealt with with great care

533
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,940
it's clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> that government could do too</font>

534
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,919
little and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would argue perhaps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

535
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,450
it's doing too little the mantra that

536
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,160
one should never regulate the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

537
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,920
think maybe taking with a little much<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

538
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:49,420
religious fervor it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear you</font>

539
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,150
could do a lot of damage by doing too

540
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,920
much and so really trying to find

541
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:57,090
sensible balance points i think is an

542
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,920
enormous challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the years ahead</font>

543
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,409
to me the two operative principle should

544
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,360
be first keeping a balance on what the

545
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,740
costs of inaction versus the cost of

546
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,290
inaction are and second trying to

547
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:10,300
approach things where action seems

548
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,940
appropriate in a minimalist way trying

549
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do the least that would get you where</font>

550
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,360
you're going and very in mind the throws

551
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:21,160
admonition<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that government</font>

552
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:22,270
appearance at least governs<font color="#CCCCCC"> best ok so</font>

553
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,790
what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about in this</font>

554
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:27,970
part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation is alternative</font>

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,909
case studies and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to keep</font>

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">moving along here let's see do it</font>

560
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,000
probably have a few extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes since</font>

561
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,320
we start a few just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you do give it</font>

562
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,220
five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

563
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,530
okay so one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government</font>

564
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do well we can help industry to</font>

collect relevant data flight statistics

provide seed money for<font color="#CCCCCC"> research and for</font>

support desired services through its own

00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,670
purchasing preferences there are a few

581
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,410
you could imagine government actually

mandating certain things and funding

583
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:28,030
them as for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example we do with Kalia</font>

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,179
in most cases enables competing

companies to discuss things that they

592
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,390
might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> uncomfortable discussing by</font>

themselves because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they be worried about</font>

any trust concerns generally government

presence mitigates those concerns so

596
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,190
again government can play a very

probably a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty good example of</font>

604
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,470
government soliciting input from a lot

good examples of the way the government

<font color="#CCCCCC">as ipv6 the folks at Commerce looked at</font>

617
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,080
the problem pretty hard and they came

618
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:46,030
away feeling that there is not a market

619
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,800
failure there's not a need for

government intervention heavy

621
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,610
intervention they did see any or an

622
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,760
opportunity perhaps for government to

623
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:55,320
focus on things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like research funding</font>

beds and interoperability they felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

627
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,419
these were areas where a government

628
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,200
might play constructive role and yet at

629
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:09,270
the same time they felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> very strongly</font>

630
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,040
let me skip ahead here that industry

00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:12,930
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take lead in</font>

00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,590
infrastructure skipping ahead they're

634
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:18,600
saying government should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a major</font>

consumer v6 products<font color="#E5E5E5"> and services but</font>

637
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,450
or by government agencies in the United

638
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,450
States private sector decisions should

639
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:30,360
be market driven so again you see sort

640
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:34,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a very delicate balance a government</font>

642
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:39,210
looked at very much the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same issues and</font>

643
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,010
they look at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a broader context</font>

644
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,330
like doesn't just deal with the internet

645
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,290
even though the Internet's plenty big I

646
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:46,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean they deal with everything down to</font>

water supply air transport all kinds of

critical infrastructures financial

infrastructures you name it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here a</font>

650
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:54,750
very general statement they make and

651
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,980
it's very clearly worded and this is one

652
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,510
where there was probably blood on the

653
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,520
floor when they were drafting this thing

654
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:02,250
so you know it was crafted with I

655
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,570
believe great care and they they say I'm

656
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to take moment to read this one</font>

657
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:07,350
where market forces are free to operate

658
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:09,450
they will be the most efficient and

659
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:11,070
efficacious vehicle to do and enhance

660
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,530
the security posture of critical

661
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:15,510
infrastructures however some suggest

662
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:17,570
that the pace<font color="#CCCCCC"> of change may be too slow</font>

663
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,800
and the response may be incomplete if

664
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:21,899
market forces proved unable to operate

665
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,240
efficiently and quickly government

666
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">should consider timely intervention but</font>

667
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,520
only where there's a good

<font color="#E5E5E5">characterization of the potential harm</font>

that could occur<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's the</font>

are working well<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough apparently</font>

though there's a lot of interventions

short of outright regulation that could

701

00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,800
called hardening the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet the report</font>

719
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:25,889
isn't online yet but which should be

720
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,600
momentarily there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one recommendation I</font>

721
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:31,080
wanted to flag to this group that's also

722
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,480
very relevant to the same things and in

723
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,159
fact in presenting it to the fool<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

724
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">act the full presidential Advisory</font>

725
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,780
Council George can write as soon as the

726
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,920
group chair strongly recommended that if

727
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,690
the group we're going to do one this

728
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be the one it's basically the</font>

729
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:47,310
sponsor research into how people make

730
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,620
their decisions about what features to

731
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:51,149
deploy trying to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> better how</font>

732
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,540
these the point of decisions actually

733
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,540
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

734
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,789
okay so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit and this</font>

735
00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:01,549
is my last few slides I'll be wrapping

736
00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:03,379
up in a second let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little about</font>

737
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:07,129
case studies<font color="#CCCCCC"> of government interventions</font>

738
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:09,590
now to me there are happy case studies

739
00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:12,110
and there are not so happy case studies

740
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">their case studies sort of like Daedalus</font>

741
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:17,899
the Greek mythological figure with the

742
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:19,879
wax wings who flies away and gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

743
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:22,039
jail and there's also some look more

744
00:28:19,879 --> 00:28:23,869
like Icarus which is his<font color="#E5E5E5"> son who flew</font>

745
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:26,210
too close to the Sun melted his wax

746
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:29,389
wings and fell into the sea and we

747
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:31,789
should have some of both on the Daedalus

748
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:33,080
side I would argue<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

749
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:34,519
initiatives that created the very

750
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,590
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about today</font>

751
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:38,450
we're government<font color="#E5E5E5"> initiatives of exactly</font>

752
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,459
this type government funding and

753
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,080
sponsorship of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ARPANET government</font>

754
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,869
funding couple hundred million bucks for

755
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,720
the NSFNET one that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> often forgotten</font>

756
00:28:44,869 --> 00:28:52,850
is the funding for Berkeley UNIX bsd

757
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:54,470
unix to put a tcp<font color="#E5E5E5"> colonel into the</font>

758
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,418
publicly available version of eunuchs

759
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:58,610
which percolated that into bazillions of

760
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:00,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">workstations in the 1980s and created</font>

761
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:03,408
the network externalities that made it

762
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:05,690
never take off so basically those

763
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:08,179
initiatives and others like them put an

764
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:10,639
absolutely critical role in creating the

765
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,720
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today now there</font>

766
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:14,449
are others that i think are a little

767
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:19,039
less happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people here</font>

768
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:22,190
remember gossip how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want to</font>

769
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:25,369
remember us it I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask it that way</font>

770
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:29,210
actually but partly I know not everybody

771
00:29:25,369 --> 00:29:33,259
has here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ray his life so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this</font>

772
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:36,110
was on 1988 1990 and a little later kind

773
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:40,759
of initiative of the set of detailed OSI

774
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:43,100
protocols<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're being pushed around the</font>

775
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:45,740
world by great many governments with

776
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:48,320
gossip the US government standardized on

777
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:49,730
these OSI protocols and they said if

778
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,439
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to acquire networking</font>

779
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:53,299
equipment or capabilities they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

780
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,279
be capable<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing gossip you don't</font>

781
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:57,590
have to use gossip but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the capability</font>

782
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,830
has to be there and it generated

783
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,539
probably a lot of waste motion and a lot

784
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:03,010
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasted expense over a period of many</font>

785
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:04,290
years

786
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:07,390
and perhaps a lot of confusion

787
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:11,200
ultimately again we have a network

788
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:13,260
externalities story a lot more tcp/ip

789
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,390
was sold in one<font color="#E5E5E5"> out in the marketplace</font>

790
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,300
OSI became irrelevant and ultimately

791
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:22,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">these procurement standards were dropped</font>

792
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:25,270
so a relatively unsuccessful use of

793
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,550
government leverage and maybe also a

794
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:31,300
dramatic illustration<font color="#CCCCCC"> for betting on the</font>

795
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:32,770
wrong horse which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a key factor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

796
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:36,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">too right you've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to watch out for</font>

799
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:43,570
decisions another example is<font color="#CCCCCC"> on metric</font>

800
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:45,970
conversion and not exactly in our field

801
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:47,439
but I think it's a good example if you

802
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,790
go back to nineteen seventy one the

803
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,620
national bureau of standards public

804
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:53,020
published report saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that metric</font>

805
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:55,870
should be the predominant if not

806
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:59,260
exclusive method of measurement in the

807
00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:02,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">united states within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years there was</font>

808
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:05,379
a metric conversion act of 1975 there's

809
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:07,660
an executive order issued in 1991 today

810
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,490
we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2004 how many people would say</font>

811
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:12,360

measurement in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> united states today I</font>

813
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:19,360
don't see any hands so in this case

814
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:23,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost everything shorted out right</font>

815
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,610
drakonian mandate was attempted because

816
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,600
there was the use of the purchasing

really that desirable you carry you I

825
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">think either way but but the point is</font>

826
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,900
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's not a guarantee that</font>

suffice in any of these cases and

829
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:51,400
there's also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk that feels bet on</font>

the wrong side<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay which brings me back</font>

831
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,540
really to my closing and my couple of

832
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,400
themes again that you need to approach

these things I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think and wien government</font>

you to approach these things with a

835
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,410
sense of balance the sober recognition

836
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:05,560
of what the costs are of action accosted

837
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:07,440
action and where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that it's</font>

838
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,990
necessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to play more of a role</font>

839
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,310
to do a minimalist role to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few minutes bill Scott I was curious</font>

if there's a v6 gossip going on right

845
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:32,530
now a mandate in other words to have

846
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:34,120
these six well not<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly but at one</font>

847

level you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue that there is as</font>

848
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:40,870
you're probably aware the Department of

Defense<font color="#CCCCCC"> has made ipv6 mandatory for</font>
