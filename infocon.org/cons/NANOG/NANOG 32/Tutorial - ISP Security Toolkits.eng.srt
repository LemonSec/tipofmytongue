1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,210
so the idea this presentation is that go

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">over some of the full sets that 18p uses</font>

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:13,759
and take those tool sets give you an

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,070
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we utilize them and how we</font>

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,590
operationalize them we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,448
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> into things like database mining</font>

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,910
like how we extract this information

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,740
what groups we push this out to what

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,970
information that we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to extract</font>

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:32,009
and what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our goal</font>

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,230
with our two full sets has always been

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,780
to provide protection against anomalous

13
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,610
data for our network and customers our

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,890
primary focus has always been our

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,809
network on the reason being is because

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">of our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network doesn't exist your</font>

17
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:50,129
network doesn't exist so most of the

18
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,980
tool sets that we utilize you know

19
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,199
you'll you'll hear about some offerings

20
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,629
and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and typically we</font>

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,519
provide these things in the core first

22
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,260
and then push them out into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer</font>

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,360
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> after we've had some certain</font>

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:09,060
amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> success in the core so what we</font>

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:14,070
define anomalous data as is infiltration

26
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:16,740
of viruses essentially hundreds

27
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,080

28
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,048

phishing schemes and that because even

35
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,610
though typically a phishing scheme isn't

somebody starts advertising your block

and the first one being prevention and

57
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,290
that's how to prevent anything from

at some moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> in time can we predict</font>

61
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,880
based on these gaps what<font color="#CCCCCC"> where an attack</font>

susceptible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to breach at detection once</font>

64
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:07,220
when somebody launches anomalous traffic

65
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:10,640
towards us can we detect it and then

66
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,650
mitigation kind of the end all because

67
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,589
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first three things do you</font>

your efforts have been worthless right

72
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:29,989
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> final finally which a lot of</font>

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave out is a prosecution this</font>

what<font color="#CCCCCC"> does prevention prevention entails</font>

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ability to prevent somebody from</font>

82
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:57,559
have global access list as well as

83
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,889
customer filters and unicast RPF in some

84
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,600
areas where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can these are all linked</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that every customer has an inbound HDL</font>

87

this is a been gone over an<font color="#E5E5E5"> audit so we</font>

89
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:18,070
download our configurations four times

90
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:21,470
daily when ensure that each customer has

91
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,969
those are those access lists they make

92
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,639
sure they match to the provisioning

there's no need to advertise that

00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:59,300
having a large footprint out there if

104
00:04:55,219 --> 00:05:02,120
you're if you're not using it routing

107
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,318

108
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:11,900
external views of our routes we perform

109
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:14,060
audits against<font color="#CCCCCC"> those routes so once</font>

110
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:18,020
again we go back into our database and

111
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:20,900
we say okay so 12 /<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever has been</font>

112
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,599
routed this way if we see a route that

113
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,400
pops up on on somebody else's network we

114
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:26,930
want it we want to know about this and

115
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,870
we especially want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know about it if</font>

116
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:35,479
it's an infrastructure route this is

117
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,939
probably this is probably too small for

118
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:39,889
you to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> you pull it up on the web</font>

119
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:41,210
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through a couple of them</font>

120
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:45,639
it's kind of what I was going over

121
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:47,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">before we break our network into peers</font>

122
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,870
customers and then our own

123
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,750
infrastructure and data centers and so

124
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,089
within our data centers it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

125
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,779
typical thing we do spoof prevention for

126
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:02,389
our own data centers most people rely to

127
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:04,699
say well they're my systems I know

128
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:06,740
they're not spoofing but what happens

129
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:08,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">when a patch then get pushed out or</font>

130
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,879
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what happens if a</font>

131
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,399
breach does occur and they can spoof it

132
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:16,069
can be a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> source if you're doing</font>

133
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:18,110
access-list audits to find out if

134
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:21,319
something's been breached don't just

135
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:23,419
rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on your intrusion detection systems</font>

136
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,210
or your internal computers and detection

137
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:28,520
systems there's things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> HCL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> counters</font>

138
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,430
that can act that can work<font color="#CCCCCC"> just as well</font>

139
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,250
I mean not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just as well but can provide</font>

140
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,500
additional information once again<font color="#E5E5E5"> route</font>

data centers if we don't

143
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,120
have to announce that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

can stateful packet inspection where you

so moving on the prediction when this

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,170
was kind of a tough one that you know

everybody prediction I you know how can

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:51,270
you do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font>

232
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,239
I'm not going to say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

233
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:55,949
predictions one hundred percent but

there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do of</font>

a predictive nature and what you can do

you know it can help you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know why if you</font>

hundred percent that just doesn't make

239
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,099
sense if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty</font>

240

percent out of it you know utilize what

241
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can so prediction is a proactive</font>

00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,060
approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dealing with the anomalous</font>

243
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,819
traffic prediction is not necessarily

244
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:24,050
forecast when the tackle occur but can

245
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,100
forecast things like type strength and

246
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:30,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes where who's going to get</font>

247
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:33,360
attacked so typically what we do is we

248
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,580
do analysis of<font color="#CCCCCC"> port scamming and</font>

249
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,520
enumeration so we look at breaches that

are occurring not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily for our</font>

this isn't necessarily scrubbing this is

328
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,160
just on payload<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

having to deploy some remote packet

<font color="#E5E5E5">use our routing protocol go ahead and</font>

335
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:37,490
there's no impact to the customer so uh

336
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:39,680
data mining so with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> correlation</font>

337
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,230
database a good example of things that

338
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,969
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do with data mining you know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">financial institution is attacked four</font>

343
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:57,890

00:15:53,900 --> 00:16:00,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">once you start populating this database</font>

345
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:04,580
you start to find some interesting

is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wednesday things like things like</font>

349
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,910
that so it does lead to some predictive

a and<font color="#CCCCCC"> b and they've all gotten attacked</font>

come from the breakdown of these a esas

367
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,240
with these source addresses and you can

368
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:07,240
provide some pretty good information and

369
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,650
it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> always work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

373
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,630
we can we can furnish to you

374
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:25,960
quartering list so like I mentioned if

375
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:28,209
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it we do discover a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CNC we</font>

376
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:32,530
essentially replicate it and we black

377
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:33,970
holder or sinkhole it so the quartering

378
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,399
lists are typically automatically

379
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,020
generated to our abuse of what records

380
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,240
for what customers are infected for

381
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,220
cleanup but the quartering list can also

382
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,570
provide something of a predictive nature

383
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:50,290
so if you have a CNC captured generally

384
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:54,520
you'll have a pretty pretty shallow

385
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:58,240
curve of when these<font color="#CCCCCC"> BOTS start dropping</font>

386
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,580
off but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can easily tell when all</font>

387
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,530
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> bots get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pulled re infected by the</font>

388
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,780

389
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:07,570
generated of<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's he who he's infected</font>

390
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,450
so he<font color="#CCCCCC"> immediately knows out the know</font>

391
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,379
knows who to go out and get again and so

392
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,660
he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send them to another</font>

422

protocols<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we get roughly about</font>

10,000 hosts per hour you know and that

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,210
prediction because it's giving you the

436
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:16,960
curve and you can react on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> before it</font>

437
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:21,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">really builds up and them and starts</font>

438
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,960
taking out networks yep

439
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:35,810
so with the dark space are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you seeing</font>

440
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:37,160
more people skipping over dark space are

441
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,950
they getting smart enough to figure out

442
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,630
that a start space or are they pretty

443
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,120
much still hitting everything off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

444
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,740
that equal so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it depends it</font>

445
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,600
depends upon what you're using this dark

446
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:50,810
space if you're using if you're dummying

447
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,370
up you know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> for like your internal</font>

448
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:55,700
customers your internally routed

449
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,080
customers like you're gumming up<font color="#CCCCCC"> 96 / 6</font>

450
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">or something like that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

451
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,639
people are just skipping over that but

452
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,530
if you're using dark address space

453
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,810
that's real address space you know

454
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,370
unreachable and routable then that's why

455
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:09,620
we're switching it up every four weeks

456
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,989
is to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they are that</font>

457
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:17,449
they're hitting dark different dark

458
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:20,360
address space all the time and we do we

459
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:22,730
do leave some classy static and that

460
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,790
never change just so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

461
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,560
baseline over that and on but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

462
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:32,330
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're avoiding that dark address</font>

463
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:35,240
space because this is you know so let me

464
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,949
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of take a step back so we have we</font>

465
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,110
have dark address space to try to pick

466
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,150
up on port scanning and enumeration and

467
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:43,370
that's the dark address space that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

468
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:45,380
switch every four weeks and then we have

469
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,959
dark address space that's really just

470
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:50,270
for warm activity you know what white

471
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,940
noise what light internet noise is like

472
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:54,590
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know moving around out there as far</font>

473
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">as that's concerned I mean I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

474
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,280
can remain pretty static because there's

475
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:03,710
no no one that's controlling that

476
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:06,410
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just randomly propagating so</font>

denial service I mean obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

490
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,610
somebody does a port scan they enumerate

then they

492
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,270
they infect somebody and then they

493
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,040
become a client they connect up to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cnc</font>

and they want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> deny service attack so</font>

495
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:50,480
it's kind of one in the same it's all

502

these servers send out ICMP UDP and TCP

traffic to all the other measurement

504

servers when they collect packet loss

jitter and everything else SNMP traps we

506
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,600
all have them the router send them out

intrusion detection systems that we have

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:55,830
out there one thing and that's that

what's bouncing off our firewalls what's

519
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:05,520
which out there charging up against our

524
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:19,250
flow records looking at backscatter and

525
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:21,510
these all go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> an alert Center and</font>

526
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:24,030
this is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do some ticket</font>

527
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:26,700
correlation and this will go into a

528
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:30,230
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of how this alert Center how</font>

529
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:34,410
this correlation really helps operations

530
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:37,650
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned so we have measurement</font>

531
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:39,690
servers a server send out ICMP to UDP

532
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:41,309
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP request other measurement</font>

533
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,190
servers around the network report back

534
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:47,970
latency so these can isolate problems

535
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:52,080
within the general region if if you do

536
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:54,899
across a cross out so<font color="#E5E5E5"> between your</font>

537
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,230
you know New York the Dallas New York to

538
00:24:54,899 --> 00:25:00,299
San Fran New York the so-and-so and you

539
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:03,659
take your<font color="#E5E5E5"> measurement servers and you</font>

540
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:05,549
have certain late latency thresholds or

541
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:08,669
packet loss threshold you can have them

542
00:25:05,549 --> 00:25:11,668
alarm based on City pair so if you're

543
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:14,279
having latency between San Francisco and

544
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:15,990
LA or something like that well that can

545
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">be picked up by measurement server</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

546
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:21,450
simply by it breaking threshold for

547
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:25,220
latency so now you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a</font>

548
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:29,010
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> between san fran and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Los Angeles</font>

549
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:32,580
so SNMP traps can isolate and correlate

550
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:34,679
over utilization of CPU or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory so</font>

551
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:38,129
now you get SNMP trap and let's say it

552
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:41,159
comes from you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the LA router so now</font>

553
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:44,360
we have it isolated not just san fran or

554
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:47,250
LA it's most likely going to be LA

555
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,229
traffic analysis can correlate CPU and

556
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:51,899
memory increases and over utilization of

557
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:56,580
backbone links so now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have our key a</font>

558
00:25:51,899 --> 00:26:02,760
system that reports well we have a over

utilized pops up link on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that la GSR so</font>

560
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,820
now we've got it isolated to a link<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

561
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:10,799
the router within the within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> city</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">dark space thresholds das detection and</font>

563
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,840
route audits so this can isolate a

performing audits on our on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our route</font>

569
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:31,019
database we realized that well soon so

570
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,820
just did a major shift in traffic and

571
00:26:31,019 --> 00:26:35,789
that's why the utilization is out of

572
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:39,570
whack we look at our dark address space

573

<font color="#CCCCCC">oh new worm came in from starting over</font>

00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:52,379
at our flow information which so we

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:04,679
additional heuristics can be performed

581
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:06,899
so one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do we</font>

582
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,940
typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> our systems are looking for</font>

583
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:11,668
denial service<font color="#E5E5E5"> text at our peering</font>

584
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,590
perimeter so if you have packets coming

585
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:15,149
across from peering from hearing

586
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,699
perimeter how do you know where they're

587
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:19,498
rather destined to so you can take a

588
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,769
look at a couple alerts so let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

589
00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:24,769
get 10 dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 to 10 dot 1 / 32 is the</font>

590
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:28,169
destination signer that's under attack

591
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:30,659
but you know typically with some of the

592
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:32,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">ddos systems at least ours we're not we</font>

593
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:35,730
don't just have one alert we might have

594
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:37,980
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or 30 anomalies going on at</font>

595
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:40,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">any one time so we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> expect our</font>

596
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,360
operations center to sit there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and take</font>

597
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,730
every alert and trace route it to see if

598
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:47,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the one that's sitting the LA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gar</font>

599
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:49,499
to see if that's the one impacting it

600
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:51,600
right so what we do is we take that

601
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:54,299
cider we take that 10 dot 10 to 10 that

602
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,649
one and we look in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our historical bgp</font>

603
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:58,190
tables and we find out who the

604
00:27:55,649 --> 00:28:00,479
originator is really simple thing to do

605
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:03,179
you don't want to do it online because

606
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,159
the now serves tech could force that

607
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:08,249
route to withdrawal so you need to look

608
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:11,279
at something historically so we get to

609
00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:12,720
we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the video s attack and the first</font>

610
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing we do is we start looking at</font>

611
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,730
additional heuristics of it we look at

612
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:21,360
the originator we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to that</font>

613
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:24,749
originator originating router so once we

614
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,639
have the originator we now know that the

615
00:28:24,749 --> 00:28:31,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp advertisement for this came out of</font>

616
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:33,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">that la router so then we try to attach</font>

617
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:36,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">the originator if we can attach well</font>

618
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,759
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send an alarm just a</font>

619
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:39,928
generic alarm router down which we

620
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,360
already have from the estimate each

621
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:44,309
route but you know correlation is the

622
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,678
key it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just because your</font>

623
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:48,360
operations guy when he gets an SNMP trap

624
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,429
for the router down he doesn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

625
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,709
caused it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets another ticket</font>

626
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:55,230
in from a denial service attack on the

627
00:28:52,710 --> 00:29:00,299
same router well now he has something<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

628
00:28:55,230 --> 00:29:01,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">can just immediately black hole it so we</font>

629
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:03,450
try to attach that router if we can get

630
00:29:01,889 --> 00:29:05,549
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> router then we just do a IP</font>

631
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:08,519
route look up and see what interface

632
00:29:05,549 --> 00:29:10,769
that that is routed to so now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

633
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:13,350
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> interface so now we can</font>

634
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:15,749
generate a ticket automatically<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

635
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:17,879
on the router and not just on the

636
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:18,370
interface but we now<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what specific</font>

637
00:29:17,879 --> 00:29:23,980
customer

638
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:26,559
is getting impacted by this dark space

639
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,120
threshold route audits to determine

640
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,220
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not this was an impacted</font>

641
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,449
operations or perhaps route theft I

642
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,570
think I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of went over those</font>

643
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:38,770
stuff counting logs can be data mined to

644
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:42,460
determine what entries were made oh so

645
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:46,379
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so kind of say taking a step</font>

646
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:49,030
back so let's say you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that LA was</font>

647
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:51,100
impacted because of some some routing

648
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:53,290
change that occurred<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the network so</font>

649
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,570
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do detect that that routing change</font>

650
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:58,120
occurred we<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately go to our tax</font>

651
00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:00,220
logs we say well what router was just

652
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,020
modified on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the exact command</font>

653
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,670
that was put in there so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

654
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,590
immediately mitigate that problem and

655
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:10,960
remove that configuration I created the

656
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:13,270
problem so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of a process</font>

657
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,110
example of you know how it's all put

658
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:20,200
together so all remote locals report

659
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:23,290
latency to ABC local which ABC local is

660
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:27,330
the SNR<font color="#E5E5E5"> co to the city SNMP trap is sent</font>

661
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:30,100
from hub router a a vessel of ABC local

662
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:33,419
traffic analysis reports that the hub

663
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:36,280
router age up links are over utilized

664
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:38,800
upstream das detection systems report

665
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:43,750
that UDP fragment flood is<font color="#CCCCCC"> dustins</font>

666
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:46,389
towards ABCD / 32 route database reports

667
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:49,660
that the originator of this last 32 was

668
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:51,429
access router a of ABC local and a

669
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,400
trouble ticket is populated with all

670
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:55,660
this information from<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the alerts and</font>

671
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,640
operations proceeds with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information</font>

672
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:02,380
because they have plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of correlation</font>

673
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:05,410
to react and they black hole it so

674
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:07,510
mitigation so mitigation what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I consider</font>

675
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:09,820
and sometimes it's tough convincing your

676
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:11,559
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this but you know you have</font>

677
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,750
all these fancy detection tools and

678
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:18,490
everything like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it once again</font>

679
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:20,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">it does he absolutely little bit so</font>

680
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:22,300
mitigation is the ability to stop the

681
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:25,629
attacker very at least minimalize it

682
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:27,790
once it's been detected you know I'm

683
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:30,190
happy at most times if I can stop ninety

684
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:32,428
percent of it so you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

685
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,720
can get right

686
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:37,419
generally accepted terms of mitigation

687
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,210
get black hole at packet filter it and

688
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:43,240
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a recent one out as a packet</font>

689
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:45,070
diversion say you know I know we've had

690
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">plenty of sessions with black holing so</font>

691
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,960
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to go into that packet</font>

692
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,149
filtering I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all need to do or</font>

693
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,720
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that or we all know how to</font>

694
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:57,850
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's you know</font>

695
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">depending upon what systems that you're</font>

696
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,289
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't filter on packet</font>

697
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:05,709
length can't filter on a lot of

698
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:07,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">different things so sometimes you really</font>

699
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,249
can't mitigate with just doing packet

700
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,139
filtering and packet filtering is not

701
00:32:09,249 --> 00:32:12,879
dynamic that the vector of the attack

702
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:16,360
changes then you have to go back and

703
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:18,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">change change the access list so packet</font>

704
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,949
diversion kinda takes care of this black

705
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:23,049
holing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's like amputating an arm</font>

706
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:26,379
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer is completely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font>

just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow it so you know</font>

710
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:36,789
black holing the only time we really use

711
00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:39,759
black holing as if we have an MSO our

712
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:44,580
dial-up account<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's on dhcp we get an</font>

715
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,139
it out of the dhcp pool and leave it

716
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:55,869
because what's what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

717
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:59,158
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trace down all these broadband</font>

718
00:32:55,869 --> 00:33:02,709
attacks are trying to filter them right

719
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,909
tracking them back something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else packet</font>

720
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,649
filtering once again you have the

721
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:08,200
capabilities what capabilities do you

722
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:13,239
have and so package diversion tries to

723
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:15,730
encapsulate both of these so just

724
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:18,309
examples of a black holing so perimeter

725
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:20,980
black hole or blocking it as it goes

726
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:22,480
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the backbone with filter mitigation</font>

727
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,429
typically we're blocking it at the

728
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,529
access router if we can get the ingress

729
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:29,110
points will try to try to block them up

730
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:31,360
at the ingress points but<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously if</font>

731
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:34,149
you know with somebody's distributed

732
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,269
attacks you know I know with us we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

733
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:39,340
you know a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred peering</font>

734
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:40,659
interface is just domestically alone we

735
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,679
don't want to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and touch every</font>

736
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:43,810
peering router to go

737
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:47,920
put packet filters up there because then

738
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:50,429
something really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can happen so yeah</font>

739
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:53,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">packet scrubbing and this is a</font>

740
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:58,750
essentially kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lowdown on unpackage</font>

741
00:33:53,080 --> 00:34:01,149
scrubbing so catch to our core we have

742
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:02,800
an su 192 course so we figured the best

743
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:05,560
place to put it it is where you have

744
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,970
them as bandwidth capacity if you're

745
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,590
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it down at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer</font>

746
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:10,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">crown what's your son if the customer</font>

747
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:13,660
has t3<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's going to get overwhelmed</font>

748
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,179
right if you put it at a data center or

749
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:18,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that then you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have you</font>

750
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">have some concerns of what else is going</font>

751
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:21,280
into that data center is your web

752
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:23,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">hosting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that data center is</font>

753
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,970
your VoIP traffic run into that data

754
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:30,310
center so we we figured<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best way to</font>

755
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:33,129
do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is put it attach it straight to</font>

756
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:36,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">the OC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 192 network put it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple</font>

757
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:38,520
locations and disperse it so when I show

758
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:41,770
the picture here you know you have just

759
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:44,320
one core router but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have in</font>

760
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:51,759
multiple different locations to handle

761
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:53,290
the distribution so and I'll go a little

762
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,260
bit more in the packet diversion later

763
00:34:53,290 --> 00:35:00,100
in the presentation so tool sets for

764
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,140
mitigation dedicated and centralized

765
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,150
black hole routers provide the

766
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:07,060
centralized repository for malicious

767
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:09,940
routes a good thing about this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

768
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:12,400
can you can offload that information you

769
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:15,490
can provide you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know organization such</font>

770
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:18,340
as abuse is whose black hole and what

771
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,839
tag are they receiving so you have you

772
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:23,500
know with these different methods you

773
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:25,660
have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> tags so if you're setting</font>

774
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:28,960
up a black hole infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might</font>

775
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:30,940
have you know tag 666 for your perimeter

776
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,250
black hole door tag 911 for your

777
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,930
diversion black hole or tag<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2020 to</font>

778
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:37,840
bring it into a sinkhole or something

779
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:40,180
like that so this you know if you have a

780
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">single light a single repository then</font>

781
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,200
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> form</font>

782
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:45,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">list off to abuse or customer care so</font>

783
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,830
that when the customer calls up and says

784
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,680
why am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I not receiving any traffic to</font>

785
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:53,299
this IP and they can go oh you know he's

786
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:56,960
tagged<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6664 he's tagged this</font>

787
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:59,390
cnc he's tagged this so he's been

788
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:04,010
triggered for a PEP evaluation or

789
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:06,520
something like that provides stability

790
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:09,140
because it's not part of the backbone

791
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:12,050
one of the worst nightmares in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

792
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,759
is like let's say you start putting you

793
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:16,910
know all these black hole tags on a

794
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,320
production router that's also carrying

795
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:20,810
customer traffic and all of a sudden

796
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">this router gets isolated and all those</font>

797
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:27,500
routes get withdrawn<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so that would</font>

798
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:30,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably not be a good thing can be</font>

799
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,270
utilized for<font color="#E5E5E5"> sink holing so at least</font>

800
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:34,340
with one of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> facilities we have a</font>

801
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,200
forensics facility behind it that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">capacity area that we can bring things</font>

803
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,480
into and take a look at a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

804
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:44,120
closer bgp sessions can be established

805
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,910
to it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have one router you can do</font>

806
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,430
ebgp sessions to it so if you have other

807
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:51,410
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that require black hole let's</font>

808
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:53,960
say you have a some type of detection

809
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:56,870
system that detects denial of service

810

<font color="#E5E5E5">tax just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> destined towards mso's well</font>

811
00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:01,759
it's almost safe because they're on dhcp

812
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,440
that you can say let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead and</font>

813
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,860
automate this and have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it automatically</font>

814
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,870
black holes and removed from dhcp so you

815
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:14,180
can it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit easier to talk to</font>

00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:15,770
to detection facilities bgp sessions can

00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">again you're looking at your routing</font>

868
00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:24,288
table and you note the next top change

869
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:25,489
and you can base an alarm on that that

870
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:27,079
way you know when the customers

871
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:29,630
diverting traffic on his own accord

872
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:31,940
because when people divert traffic

873
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:33,739
things can get congested and you should

874
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:40,160
let your operation center just know

875
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:43,239
about that so now so now we're diverting

876
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,319
the traffic into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scrubbing facility</font>

877
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:49,369
the good thing about the scrubbing

878
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:52,910
facilities is systems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> riverhead</font>

879
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:56,559
which is now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cisco guard or clouds</font>

880
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:59,598
healed it's it's essentially packet

881
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:02,059
packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate limiting which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've always</font>

882
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,940
been a strong opponent against it

883
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:06,559
because um you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know rate limiting</font>

884
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,640
against the destination really doesn't

885
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:11,450
do you any good if it's a critical

886
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:12,920
service so but scrubbing facilities kind

887
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,629
of take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different perspective they're</font>

888
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,940
now doing packet rates on source

889
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:19,880
addresses so it's extremely dynamic

890
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:21,980
they're taking each individual / 32 and

891
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,500
are doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the packet rate against it so</font>

892
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,329
if one address goes away and another

893
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,700
address comes back it's still the same

894
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:32,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">destination cider and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rate limiting</font>

895
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:35,538
is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply the scrubbing the the</font>

896
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:37,849
scrubbers have capabilities to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

897
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:39,380
the application<font color="#CCCCCC"> layer they can filter on</font>

898
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:41,299
pretty much any part of the packet that

899
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:45,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want to so you get greater filter</font>

900
00:40:41,299 --> 00:40:47,150
capability so effort goes into the

901
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,890
scrubbing facility then we push<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out</font>

902
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:54,289
through an MPLS or through GRE because

903
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,368
if you're not encapsulating it's just

904
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:56,839
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right back into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

905

906
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:03,828
have some horrible loop going in there

907
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:07,960
so mpls VPN or GRE<font color="#E5E5E5"> is normally the</font>

908
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:07,960
accepted way to get back to the customer

909
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:18,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so now the traffic's going back to</font>

910
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,640
the customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they have clean pipes</font>

911
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:28,240
so prosecution the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to identify</font>

00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:30,619
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> aid in the prosecution of an attacker</font>

913
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,229

supporting data trace back data where

not stooped the metadata that you

<font color="#E5E5E5">your detection and desserts packet</font>

957
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:42,288
captures if you go into the package you

958
00:43:40,309 --> 00:43:44,209
take a closer look at it you divert it

959
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:46,869
or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you pull</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out TCP</font>

960
00:43:44,209 --> 00:43:49,069
dump to take a look at it save it

961
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:50,359
timestamps obviously you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of</font>

962
00:43:49,069 --> 00:43:52,849
the state and makes for the data that

963
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:56,119
you're collecting has<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamps so when</font>

964
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:58,940
you collected it the correlation

965
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:00,589
database going back into<font color="#E5E5E5"> our what we're</font>

966
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,019
doing for detection make sure all that

967
00:44:00,589 --> 00:44:05,119
information gets populated and that goes

968
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:07,430
into supporting that that goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

969
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,229
supporting data all this informations on

970
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:10,759
handle that hand it over to leave for

971
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:13,189
compliancy to make sure that the

972
00:44:10,759 --> 00:44:15,349
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> is correct handled properly</font>

973
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:17,359
turned over to the investigators they

974
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:20,749
furnish subpoenas or court orders that

975
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:27,430
properly<font color="#CCCCCC"> obtain the information and so</font>

976
00:44:20,749 --> 00:44:27,430
on and it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 45 minutes</font>

977
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:43,940
any questions a

978
00:44:56,359 --> 00:45:00,980
so you're collecting a lot of

979
00:44:58,539 --> 00:45:03,349
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your network there and</font>

980
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,390
the issue of customer privacy comes up

981
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:06,890
when you're doing this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you</font>

982
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:09,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle that when you're doing packet</font>

983
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:11,239
capture collecting every data right so

984
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:16,400
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask permission from the customer</font>

985
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:19,039
before we do anything in our AUP and our

986
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,470
a eps<font color="#E5E5E5"> are well defined so like in an</font>

987
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,210
instance where we have an an MSO

988
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:25,669
customer a broadband customer that's

989
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:28,039
getting attacked<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's defined in the AUP</font>

990
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:29,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if it's impacting our network in</font>

991
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:33,410
any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right to do</font>

992
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:35,089
that those types of captures for mis

993
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:37,339
customers obviously those aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

994
00:45:35,089 --> 00:45:40,339
to be impacting the network art I mean

995
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:43,400
they can be but essentially they're so

996
00:45:40,339 --> 00:45:45,410
in those cases we do ask we get all the

997
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:51,230
customer and say we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a packet</font>

998
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:54,319
capture for this exam yeah can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hear</font>

999
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:59,329
me yeah can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go over the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP anycast</font>

1000
00:45:54,319 --> 00:46:04,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">of EGP yeah yeah so essentially we're</font>

1001
00:45:59,329 --> 00:46:07,910
we're taking you know 10 dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

1002
00:46:04,249 --> 00:46:11,029
that one and we're putting it on all of

1003
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:14,118
our scrubbing facilities when we send

1004
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:16,789
out that next top update from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

1007
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:25,879
packets coming in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to follow</font>

1009
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:32,599

scrubbing facility what happens when you

get<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> China and they're all</font>

1016

00:46:47,509 --> 00:46:52,069
of your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> from getting overwhelmed</font>

1018
00:46:49,299 --> 00:46:59,630
like how do you we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a</font>

1019
00:46:52,069 --> 00:47:01,519
capacity problem yet so until that until

1020
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:02,839
that arises but once again that's you

1021
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:05,180
know that's why we're homing it to the

1022
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:06,710
OC 192 network there so that we don't

1023
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:09,910
want it we don't want to have to deal

1024
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:09,910
with capacity problems

1025
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:15,119
when you bring your traffic that from

your data scrubbing<font color="#CCCCCC"> facility</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you have</font>

a gr8 help to every customer router

1028
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:25,200
already set up so GRE is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one option and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">initially we start we we were if a</font>

1033
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:36,270
have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know contact the customer have</font>

1034
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:39,660
to know what the customers capabilities

1035
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:43,530
were of doing GRE the problem we ran

1036
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">into was you know some vendors you know</font>

1037
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:49,260
require a superfluous card in order to

1038
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:51,690
do GRE which we don't have on our excess

1039
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:54,960
routers so it's kind of expensive to

1040
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:59,670
take up a whole slot on something just

1041
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:01,530
to be GRE so fortunately we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were we're</font>

1042
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:04,890
at a point where we're doing mpls build

1043
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:07,320
out to all of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> excess routers so</font>

1044
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:09,569
we've now working on switching all of

1045
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,800
that over the MPLS and then it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1046
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:13,040
matter of throwing the customer in the

00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">work</font>

1048
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:26,790
all right I'm gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> go drink some beer</font>

1049
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,790
thank you
