heavy load of the of those cache servers

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,250
so today we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about our</font>

and the target website is under attack

and access<font color="#E5E5E5"> line is filled with Adidas</font>

of the website Oh removes the a record

April the kwenda and when Anthony attack

80
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:17,139

so the worms cannot attack the website

88
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:48,508
so that the order of the website is

any time I don't know that exactly so

109
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:09,600
but we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix it quickly because</font>

110
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:13,590
then our DNS cache servers are<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font>

queries to that to devote to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sobber</font>

114
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:33,660
ok so the query not going to an author

00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:38,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">JD summer and this wakes all return the</font>

121
00:07:52,580 --> 00:08:00,930

00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:19,620
april attack so we decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this</font>

126
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:23,040
attack this method again in<font color="#CCCCCC"> May and this</font>

127
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:27,860

<font color="#CCCCCC">every attack and the bottom is an attack</font>

130
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:38,978
in May and Wendy this<font color="#E5E5E5"> began and the</font>

oil eclairisse are increased very

134
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:55,870
dramatically but then when returning the

137
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:10,800
the time we we capture the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS package</font>

138
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:14,940
and I like those packets personally and

139
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:19,120
this was a graph of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> may attack and</font>

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> too despite indicates an extremely</font>

reject<font color="#E5E5E5"> the queries from the users that</font>

295
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:27,789
caused our cache server to be overloaded

296
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:37,610
if our goal is just to keep the server

297

low load level there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> another possible</font>

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,559
on our server so that it won't send a

very much

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:54,950
we we have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a few questions I'm</font>

345
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:57,970
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask Phillip Phillip Phillip has</font>

346
00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:02,090
oh I thought you had left the building

347
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:05,480
are you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you prepared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we will</font>

donk inside a question about the TCP

trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess what I'm</font>

353
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:24,560
asking is you had your you were talking

354
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:30,260
to an ad man who wouldn't reduce the

355
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:32,840
size of the ya-ya<font color="#E5E5E5"> are sad but would it</font>

356
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:37,610
was that was that query working for

357
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:40,939
anyone oh yeah oh wait boy past Dora Oh

358
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:46,879
Adam is ready to reduce or open<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tcp</font>

359
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:50,750
port and<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh it may it may affect all of</font>

360
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:54,290
the users I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is at the</font>

361
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:57,830
other side now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just did oh yeah okay</font>

362
00:23:54,290 --> 00:24:01,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">so okay just like like holding was the</font>

363
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,629
right thing to do yeah

364
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:09,430
hi I'm Sam Wyler many Rob Thomas is in

365
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the room because you may want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get up</font>

366
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:13,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">and answer this for your proposal that</font>

367
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,629
you use a well-known black hole address

368
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,850
I'm wondering what happens if you play

369
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a few more steps do the</font>

370
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,330
miscreants change their code to detect

371
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,820
your black hole address and just have

372
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:28,720
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> coat fall over and die do they</font>

373
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:31,899
quit using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DNS entirely where does</font>

374
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,510
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> play out oh you mean that the oh</font>

375
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:39,250
you think of Derek black hole address

376
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:42,040
cause another attack for when you use a

377
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:49,050
well known address the attacker will

378
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:49,050
know that also another site

379
00:24:55,779 --> 00:25:04,129
hi Bill hi this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is me speaking Japanese</font>

380
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:07,159
or not as the case may be yeah using

381
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:09,049
well known addresses is a bad idea don't

382
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:13,009
do it if you can get away with it if you

383
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:17,720
can't get away<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it you're you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

384
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:20,179
trouble having honey pots and other

385
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,970
other such things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to catch people is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

386
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:27,399
know it it's part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> arsenal of</font>

387
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:29,749
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have so if you have a</font>

388
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:34,369
quote unquote<font color="#E5E5E5"> well-known black hole</font>

389
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:37,609
address and people find it you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

390
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:38,988
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have to move it eventually because</font>

391
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:42,228
they will know people will find it out

392
00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:44,509
but this is a technique one at one

393
00:25:42,229 --> 00:25:47,809
technique<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has been demonstrated to</font>

394
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:50,989
work in today's environment will it work

395
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:54,470
five years from now probably not or at

396
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:57,679
least it<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be as effective but there</font>

397
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:59,389
are i<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean the IAB and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF people</font>

398
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:04,159
have come out and said use of well known

399
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:10,129
addresses this is probably a bad idea so

400
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:12,090
this one works now thank you see more

401
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:16,750
questions

402
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:19,169
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you very much thank you</font>

403
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,170
very much
