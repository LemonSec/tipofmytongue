00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:14,790
14 and a little thing about attendees we

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,330
looking at registration figures from

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,580
yesterday we have about 170 people

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,169
registered for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> erin meeting and</font>

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:25,019
approximately 600 people registered for

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,650
the nanog meeting those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all both</font>

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,269
very very good numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as you would</font>

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">suspect some people are going to both</font>

11
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,180
and right now we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's somewhere on</font>

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,730
95 people are going to both meetings

13
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,829

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">many that 95 is the first time that they</font>

the past it's an excellent<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity</font>

63
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:04,260
for you to air an idea for a policy

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,140
without having to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a formal proposal</font>

65

on mail list it's a good opportunity if

discussion and get some input back and

68
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,389
feedback that may help you to make it

69
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,950
into a stronger policy or may be some

might have to be changed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I encourage</font>

between the printed agenda and what's on

the web you know we have an extra long

lunch today and tomorrow afternoon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

483
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:51,460
many of the talks have been moved up a

half hour due to a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

cancellations this is my last slide but

486
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:02,919
it's a serious warning if you are using

487
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:05,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">your laptop to send</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data to your home</font>

488

clear you know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy they are to pick</font>

491
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:16,360
up and we've demonstrated it before here

492
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:17,740
and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF there's absolutely no</font>

493
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,539
problem at all for someone to pick up

494
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,820
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> password if you're sending it in</font>

495
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:24,850
plain<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASCII you should be using some</font>

496
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:30,639
kind of application level encryption SSH

497
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:33,668
or VPN client is what we recommend so do

498
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,840
be very cautious about that and that's

499
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:36,840
all I have
