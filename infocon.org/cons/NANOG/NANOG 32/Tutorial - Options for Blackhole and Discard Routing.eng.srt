1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we got a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple different</font>

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">categories as far as what kind of things</font>

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,099
have you black ball the first thing is

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,190
obviously customer stuff ok you have tax

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,269
going to customers or<font color="#E5E5E5"> tax from customers</font>

6
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,559
the sources of that could be other

7
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,369
customers for people who are off net

8
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,990
people that are in peer network to you

9
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,539
or transit networks you that are coming

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,189
to your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> you also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have people</font>

11
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,119
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in control of it right so if</font>

12
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,410
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are controlling</font>

13
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,920
these big zombie farms and if you can

14
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,650
find them big it then you can stop the

15
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">blackpool them as well the last category</font>

16
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,610
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there is is something that</font>

17
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,769
we've thought about for a while and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

18
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,850
have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that of networks</font>

19
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,730
that you may not want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have people</font>

20
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,989
come on net to reach so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool to</font>

21
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">have stuff inside your network but young</font>

22
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,070
people coming on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so bogans is a</font>

23
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,000
good one<font color="#E5E5E5"> Martian routes is a good one</font>

24
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,140
some of these infrastructure things I

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,629
was talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier these voice or</font>

26
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,980
video gateways if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are pieces of</font>

27
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,239
your infrastructure that shouldn't be

28
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,739
reached by people on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network well</font>

29
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,269
then that's a good kid that's a good

30
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,000
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may want to think about black</font>

31
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,680
calling at your hearing sighs keep

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,760
things off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your networking that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

33
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,760
you're only exposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers</font>

34
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:12,570
so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some nice graphs so here we</font>

35
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,890
have our backbone network okay we have

36
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,270
some backbone matters and peering sites

37
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,730
and core routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff down for the age</font>

38
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:22,500
we have some dedicated customers down<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

39
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,650
the bottom and the bottom right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

40
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,870
some broadband users and you see we have

41
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,420
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of Representatives attack</font>

42
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,920
sources out in the world so of course

43
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to these are all peering</font>

44
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,560
sites right now that are coming in via a

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,940
user of<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting hosed now how you know</font>

46
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the dsl using having problems I</font>

47
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,970
don't know they could call you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

48
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,130
actually watching your link<font color="#E5E5E5"> utilizations</font>

49
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,650
you see something sudden spike up 310

50
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,839
whatever so however<font color="#E5E5E5"> you decide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

51
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,070
is a problem you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in in this</font>

52
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,020
case we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our black</font>

53
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,169
hole router we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inject some</font>

54
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,449
black hole route into our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

55
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,290
the effect of that is that we're going

56
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,510
to be dropping<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets</font>

57
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,360
on the peering sense

58
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,310
now

59
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,870
what this is doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously is he can't</font>

60
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,509
go out off our network to get back in

61
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,580
town for throwing stuff away that's

62
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:13,660
destined for him but all the services if

63
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:18,180
he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> using on our network for now</font>

64
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:20,440
protected if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this for</font>

65
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,180
one of the dedicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers may have</font>

66
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,490
maybe a whole subnet of addresses the

67
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,980
only black calling 132 then you know

68
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,020
we're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that host black hold at</font>

69
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,340
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pier but all the other people on</font>

70
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">that subject now have full access to the</font>

71
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,930
fight okay where's the four maybe they

72
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,930
did

73
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,250
now talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> from customers now</font>

74
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,569
these slides can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be pushed together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

75
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,640
be happy at the same time is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font>

76
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:46,339
to look at lots of lines on the graph so

77
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,839
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about things from customers here we</font>

78
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,480
have somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the world there</font>

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is has a farm maybe unknowingly we</font>

80
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,599
have a broadband users who've been

81
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,940
affected with some virus and they're

82
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,899
slamming one of our other customers so

83
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,859
this case we do the same thing we're

84
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,290
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go a black hole Brad we're</font>

85
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,849
going to inject some routes for that

86
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,470
customer that slashed urdu is being

87
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:06,190
tacked in this case will be dropping

88
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,190
along the edge of our network

89
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:15,050
you

90
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,670
so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about down near the</font>

91
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,840
bottom is dedicated customers listen you

92
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,829
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> customer has multiple sites in</font>

93
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,510
your network right that's one real

94
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:25,880
estate if you were to be black<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling</font>

95
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">their 32 or some subnet if they're</font>

96
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,760
having multiple problems out all your

97
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,060
routers on all your edge and all your

98
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,980
pure auditors then while<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's saving</font>

99
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,520
them their bandwidth they're not able to

100
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,410
get traffic from their other sites so if

101
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,880
you only do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at the peering sites now</font>

102
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,319
they can move on net between your sites

103
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,890
and they're happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I can attack</font>

104
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">them outside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the world so we've kind of</font>

105
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,369
built some<font color="#E5E5E5"> structuring of seeing the</font>

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,830
slides where we have multiple discard

107
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,870
next time and that signifies different

108
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,820
things all routers only pirata is only

109
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,380
edge routers so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build as much</font>

110
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,570
stratification and complex eating<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's</font>

111
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,890
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> right-click you know you</font>

112
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,890
should keep it simple if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

113
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,940
the last one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you can magically</font>

114
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,680
mystically find these controllers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

115
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,590
they're a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be black</font>

116
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,150
home you inject their stuff any black

117
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,600
hole and every writer you got you don't

118
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,600
lemon<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're now</font>

119
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,800
ok how we done questions

120
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:24,799
problem

121
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,590
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah so no not exactly so the</font>

122
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,240
question had to do with certainly if

123
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,409
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be black holing stuff we</font>

124
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,760
could be black calling valuable

125
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,760
resources at the customer site

126
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,710
chances are

127
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,960
we step in here if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to you know</font>

128
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,250
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a customer precipitated event so</font>

129
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,289
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to advertise this route</font>

130
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,210
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to call us and say hey I got</font>

131
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,710
a problem I'm being das on this on this

132
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">port so they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knowingly going to take</font>

133
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,609
that staff we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut off</font>

134
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,500
service I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right now we</font>

135
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:11,360
envision us proactively doing that

136
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:15,500
because we're gonna do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for our</font>

137
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,010
resources but not for customers good

138
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,010
question yeah

139
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,979
one quick comment in response that is it

140
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,260
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade off I mean obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

141
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:28,199
got a situation work when you black hole

142
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,490
it as a route as opposed to say what I

143
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,820
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of people traditionally done</font>

144
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,949
is mr. Crabb access-list right you can

145
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,500
be more grain<font color="#CCCCCC"> under state stops tribe if</font>

146
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:39,150
you can identify attack that's you know

147
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,190
hitting them on their tongue at port or

148
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,469
something else you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

149
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,990
just that traffic in this case it's a

150
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,250
it's more responsive but as you

151
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,320
mentioned the trade-off<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you're</font>

152
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,660
killing all traffic but we have had

153
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases where that trade-off is actually</font>

154
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,790
the better storage is one the response

155
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,888
can happen quicker and in some cases

156
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,470
well we've got downstream customers for

157
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:04,860
example 11 center<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe hypothetically</font>

158
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:07,260
speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hosting provider that's</font>

159
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,310

160
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,219
that they're out there attacking

161
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,110
websites

162
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:16,190
maybe something hypothetically speaking

163
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:18,980
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIAA and so when that guy gets</font>

164
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:21,230
attacked right the hosting provider

165
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">quite gets full and if we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

166
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">go in black hole either for him or give</font>

167
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,450
him the mechanisms which we will talk

168
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">about later to allow him to actually</font>

169
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:33,260
when he feels necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> black ball that</font>

170
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular destination address he</font>

171
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,880
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> opens the pipe back up for all</font>

172
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,200
his other hosting customers so yeah he's

173
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,870
got one customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely unhappy</font>

174
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,420
but he's got 20 or so customers that are

175
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,830
that are happy again it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a</font>

176
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,160
temporary solution but it's a very

177
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,960
responsive very effective tool but yeah

178
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,610
it does have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade off though you're</font>

179
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,130
basically just<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the guy off the</font>

180
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:58,360
air forever period of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

181
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have that black</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hole actors</font>

182
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so let's start talking about</font>

183
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,310
configuration things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's three</font>

184
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,599
more cool than theory

185
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we're going to have two options</font>

186
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,770
for doing this card we're going to have

187
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,300
some static routes that's off to one or

188
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,150
this thing called discard interface so

189
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">some static routes first here we have a</font>

190
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:25,909
config<font color="#CCCCCC"> send it from a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Juniper adder we</font>

191
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,849
have three static route through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pond</font>

192
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:32,150
so we having three next top 20 20 to 10

193
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:34,069
11 or three and 105 in our case most be

194
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,840
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> next top you see throughout the</font>

195
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:38,000
presentation so we have nice consistency

196
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,489
here like I said before you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,680
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these you can make 5 10 20 and</font>

198
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,479
make it as complex as you want to you

199
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,919
can have just the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just have</font>

200
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,349
everything just went go to the same next

201
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">stop black gold see you later we have</font>

202
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:51,800
we've seen some value in having

203
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,440
multiples yes sir<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what what's the</font>

204
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,900
value so the value is you can have the

205
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,699
only drop on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> piers drop on all the</font>

206
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,020
routers only drop on the edges so if you

207
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:01,460
build those stratification stuff what

208
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,639
we're using this at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NEX offshore ok</font>

209
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,909
good question of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll show up</font>

210
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,409
in the dining table now just a word of

211
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:10,639
warning caution if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

212
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:12,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">this especially you're going to be using</font>

213
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,659
this to stop dos attacks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

214
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:17,240
large volumes of traffic reject may not

215
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:18,469
be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best option okay because when you</font>

216
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,639
do that you're something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that guy's EMPs</font>

217
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:22,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're talking about setting stuff up</font>

218
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:24,319
two methods we won stuff like that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

219
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:27,440
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> recommend discard but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for sake of</font>

220
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,199
completeness they're all the options so

221
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,460
on a similar note here's the iOS output

222
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,089
against<font color="#E5E5E5"> straightforward since internet</font>

223
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,610
stops here we go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a null 0 and again</font>

224
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:39,169
though the writing table so that is

225
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,630
option<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 you do static routes and just</font>

226
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,299
blast it over the entire network all the

227
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,860
routers get the same set of stuff

228
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:47,000
whether you use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> chicken laptop or</font>

229
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,420
not is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to depend on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy of</font>

230
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,880
the right match you can reply option two

231
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:55,670
is on the juniper routers we have the

232
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">same color discard interface</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's</font>

233
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually an interfaith on the router so</font>

234
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,470
you go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> your outlook up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

235
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:02,180
forward it to this interface as opposed

236
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,449
to just doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight up death</font>

237
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:07,219
discard or reject you can have a logical

238
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:08,750
unit unit 0 if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of the</font>

239
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,730
interfaces we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put multiple</font>

240
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,339
destinations there be multiple IP

241
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,420
addresses that's gonna be our next tops

242
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:16,940
what we're gaining from this is we can

243
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,260
apply filters to this interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in</font>

244
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,029
an outbound direction so now we can be

245
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing logging sets logging counting</font>

246
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:23,779
sampling<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just do a</font>

247
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,850
static route with you discard boom<font color="#E5E5E5"> pack</font>

248
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done you know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right it's</font>

249
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool it's work but we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really get</font>

250
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:30,079
invisibility what's happening there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

251
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,040
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to pull that out with</font>

252
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:36,329
this discard interface

253
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,910
so here's the configuration piece this

254
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:40,109
interface so one question that keeps

255
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,310
coming up when I when I previous two

256
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,699
people is why do i need this destination

257
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,508
thing because it's an interface because

258
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:47,910
we're putting this in the forwarding

259
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:49,769
table<font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually need the router needs</font>

260
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,969
to think about we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to send</font>

261
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,290
this if i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to send it now it's</font>

262
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">not really sending anywhere hi it's just</font>

263
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,439
partying it but because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of wearing that</font>

264
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,910
route look up in this forwarding paths

265
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,720
decision I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> some place to</font>

266
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:02,160
technically send it to ordinarily your

267
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,290
router learns that via routing protocols

268
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay where you can figure something or</font>

269
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,740
it gets or whatever there's some other

270
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:10,439
method it learns these next top values

271
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,569
and who the subnet IP address is on the

272
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,889
far side of the length well here we

273
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:17,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have that option okay so basically</font>

274
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:19,380
just tell the router hey here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

275
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:20,310
quote next hop that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to go to ok</font>

276
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,250
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's reason the destination</font>

277
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,140
command for

278
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,400
if you don't want to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> 32s on your</font>

279
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,040
regular interface that's fine to do

280
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,410
whatever sudden<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want we decided</font>

281
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,930
to keep things 145 so pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clear</font>

282
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,760
way to go so you see down the bottom

283
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,870
here showing her face output we have the

284
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,870
interface metabolic hospital

285
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,819
so is this clear we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> static routes we</font>

286
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:47,410
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> despair interface</font>

287
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,410
when our case we're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 next class</font>

288
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so that's option one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's first</font>

289
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,470
piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and play back</font>

290
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:54,970
down so now the second piece we have to

291
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,009
go out into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network and lay down is</font>

292
00:10:54,970 --> 00:11:03,009
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we find stuff how we do this math</font>

293
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:04,720
in peace the two main ways which

294
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:05,680
probably would be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> intuitive you</font>

295
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,579
thought about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we can do things</font>

296
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,050
about IP addresses well yeah that's okay

297
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:13,750
it works<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them know what they</font>

298
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,769
are that's not a recommendation for me

299
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,699
because that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that you know Wayne</font>

300
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:16,930
comes beat me over the head<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

301
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:19,269
that's administrator we kind of pain the

302
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,859
button I could be maintaining IP address

303
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:23,649
things all day long if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't avoid</font>

304
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,720
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we said yeah we can avoid it let's</font>

305
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,040
use communities yes we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to we</font>

306
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,779
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the big stratification of</font>

307
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP communities that we're going to use</font>

308
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:32,560
our policy in our route maps we're going

309
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take the routes within community</font>

310
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,849
values<font color="#CCCCCC"> and sign up for next up values so</font>

311
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:38,258
obviously for things we're injecting

312
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">where your total control will add on</font>

313
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:41,139
communities like we want we'll send them

314
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">out for things that the customer is</font>

315
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:43,509
going to send us though that'll be

316
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:45,699
something we communicate to the customer

317
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:48,370
hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> here our community one or two or</font>

318
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:50,019
three if you would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to blackpool</font>

319
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,100
your stuff on all the routers send<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

320
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:52,600
out with this community if you want to

321
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,269
send only on the pier adder send us a

322
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,769
rat with second community we're watching

323
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:59,040
stuff inbound on the network will take

324
00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:00,630
appropriate<font color="#E5E5E5"> app</font>

325
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,920
the other thing of course with

326
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,970
communities is that you know it's pretty

327
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,110
scalable because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to build</font>

328
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,699
the structure want to put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in place</font>

329
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,079
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you got to go to</font>

330
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:10,250
routers and rather than rounded up

331
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:12,750
dating access for physicians<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

332
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:15,889
when things go beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Lionel I'd say</font>

333
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:18,029
five riders that's kind of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

334
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:20,069
just for the sake of completeness we do

335
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:22,560
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some examples using both so here's</font>

336
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:24,870
the rotten filter version so I'm policy

337
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,699
called black hole by route I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

338
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:31,350
four different routes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm signing</font>

339
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:35,069
the next top of 2202 that 101 and then I

340
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:36,449
apply that to my between it should be

341
00:12:35,069 --> 00:12:40,410
pretty straightforward<font color="#E5E5E5"> well known thing</font>

342
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:41,939
for people in PG people here's the part

343
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,860
of the iOS version again with routes so

344
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,170
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ask this list 88 we have</font>

345
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:50,279
routes in there we match that in a route

346
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,810
map and apply the same next<font color="#E5E5E5"> top you'll</font>

347
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,730
see in later slides this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular next</font>

348
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:58,258
off 101 is what we're going to designate

349
00:12:53,730 --> 00:13:00,540
as all possible route so in this example

350
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:01,560
any of these routes<font color="#CCCCCC"> fully black hole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

351
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,199
every possible router so whether it

352
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,630
comes in from a customer or caring site

353
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:08,589
or neutral location for whatever you're

354
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:12,000
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get black hole</font>

355
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:12,000
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we have to play</font>

356
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:16,040
policies look pretty and write nicely

357
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:19,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty similar for communities okay so</font>

358
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,170
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> really outlandish here all we do</font>

359
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,910
is match on one community at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the neck</font>

360
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:26,079
same same next<font color="#E5E5E5"> top now if you notice the</font>

361
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:28,009
bottom the community definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

362
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:33,170
you'll see in later slides we've

363
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:34,999
designated<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5502 5599</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as black hole</font>

364
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:39,170
communities that gives us a really wide

365
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:41,709
range of stuff to matching on defining

366
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,709
etc

367
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:49,690
same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for iOS committee list again</font>

368
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:53,829
mountain around outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> picnic stop now</font>

369
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:54,970
a note on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the implementation of</font>

370
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,220
how we're doing the regular expressions

371
00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:01,270
if you notice on the two slides here and

372
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:04,690
go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> one here's the junos</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 55 dot and</font>

373
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:07,949
a dollar sign iOS<font color="#E5E5E5"> League at 55 dot and</font>

374
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:10,210
underscore and that's mainly because

375
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,420
junipers go through and it looks at each

376
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:16,090
individual community value separately

377
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:18,189
iOS is using it as a string values so

378
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,590
when we use the dollar sign we didn't

379
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the result we expected so we played</font>

380
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,740
around with both<font color="#E5E5E5"> sides that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is</font>

381
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">how it works how we deal with been up in</font>

382
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:30,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">there but just something being aware of</font>

383
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:32,950
you guys you dint this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so here's</font>

384
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,370
our structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> um we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paying for these</font>

385
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions</font>

386
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,880
yeah so having<font color="#E5E5E5"> the structure built ahead</font>

387
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,579
of time not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only gives you the plan to</font>

388
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,380
move forward but makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> much easier</font>

389
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:49,579
totally shoot operate the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

390
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,880
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you're expecting ahead of</font>

391
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:54,120
time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel ready for the better</font>

392
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,560
security I mean

393
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,650
you know it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> as good as who you</font>

394
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vary some pieces that you</font>

395
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,930
can't avoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to give the</font>

396
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,319
customers that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

397
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:07,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">well-known thing so some transportation</font>

398
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,300
like I said we've taken all<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5500 that</font>

399
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,620
whole range to be black holes within

400
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,479
that we broke<font color="#E5E5E5"> them up into groups of 10</font>

401
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,920
so the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten we're going to use for</font>

402
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">routes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to set infant</font>

403
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,849
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so professor what's going</font>

404
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,770
to send us route was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to black hole</font>

405
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,940
and stuff their routes it better<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

406
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:25,589
one of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten community to catch</font>

407
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,940
we've also got some for things we're

408
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:28,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to inject under customers behalf</font>

409
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:30,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">yes we have matching pairs we have the</font>

410
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,500
customer can send us through outs we're

411
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,790
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inject</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their out to ourselves</font>

412
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,190
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use different communities for</font>

413
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,839
that because we don't want to be

414
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,760
accepting just one broad set makes it

415
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:42,240
harder to keep the customer out if we

416
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,439
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> boge on rounds marsh and</font>

417
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,110
things like that another general

418
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,820
category provider routes these are the

419
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,670
services okay these are your<font color="#E5E5E5"> voice video</font>

420
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,220
gateway things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you catch those</font>

421
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,599
on and send about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network can get</font>

422
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go</font>

423
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so a couple of slides going</font>

424
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,540
through some examples of possible naming

425
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,430
things what they're doing things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

426
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,439
that so customer now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is black hole all</font>

427
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:09,010
that's a 50 50 1 i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set that</font>

428
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,390
to the 101 next time so again 101 for

429
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:16,270
this discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible riders</font>

430
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:18,040

431
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:21,130
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer black hole just and</font>

432
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">appearing sites ok and that's 5503 so</font>

433
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,570
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pay i know where they've</font>

434
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:28,840
called we've been able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

435
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:30,370
what the attacks coming from off net so

436
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,690
we tell them hey send us this route or

437
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,250
they figured out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they sent us this</font>

438
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,200
round we're going to block is in

439
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,630
appearing site so on that traffic is

440
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">still good let's light the site stuff</font>

441
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:43,800
within your network still<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok turning</font>

442
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,800
sites or<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's your shutting down</font>

443
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:50,100
so not surprisingly we have the same

444
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:54,579
structure virat so we're going to inject

445
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:58,209
so 5521 pizza 523<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> match at the</font>

446
00:16:54,579 --> 00:17:00,329
same set of next hops same set of

00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:02,059
instructions

448
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:04,879
we've actually built<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more</font>

449
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:07,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">stratification</font>

450
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,930
in this scenario and instead of just

451
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,550
dropping on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge on the peering</font>

452
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,270
slice you drop on the court so you come

453
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:15,079
up one level from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network get a</font>

454
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:20,150
couple of reasons maybe you want to do

455
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:22,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you could have let see a desire to</font>

456
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:25,400
have stuff cranking away<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing maybe</font>

457
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:27,560
hairpin turns inside just this pop area

458
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,170
and not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest in your network that's</font>

459
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:34,010
one often<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be another option that</font>

460
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:35,570
you have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitoring and step</font>

461
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:39,140
collecting capabilities on your

462
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:41,300
different sets routers for whatever

463
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,160
whatever reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do it that</font>

464
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:46,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">is knockin and that's where for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

465
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,250
top comes in so for this discussion we

466
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:52,480
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 ones all 103 is peers part in</font>

467
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,480
one of lives on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a core layer</font>

468
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,939
alright so next grouping of stuff we

469
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:04,480
have Martians okay that's 30 got the RFC

470
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:07,150
and Canadian addresses 31 notice these

471
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,340
are all going to all routers things

472
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:12,310
we've designated as never see anywhere

473
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:15,490
just traffic one of the possible

474
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:17,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vantage's of doing this is you could</font>

475
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,340
depending on how you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lay stuff</font>

476
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,810
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll probably end up in the midst</font>

477
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,699
of both is get rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of your</font>

478
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,980
filter compartes your network you're

479
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,590
maintaining these huge actress list or

480
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,850
drought pokers for all the reserved

481
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,500
addresses or all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bogue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on space</font>

482
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,000
things like that if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this</font>

483
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,440
from one central spot or multiple

484
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,220
central spots and you have a more

485
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,020
automated way to do it then it avoid you

486
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,770
having to go and touch all the routers

487
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:44,200
on your period energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> updatestar so</font>

488
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:47,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">reserve the dresses the public exchange</font>

489
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,030
you know these are spots multiple public

490
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">peering points places you're not at</font>

491
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,660
because if you're at their well you

492
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,620
don't want to black going out right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

493
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,920
mean you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not another</font>

494
00:18:53,620 --> 00:19:01,629
wife so places you're not at you want a

495
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:03,970
black hole that stuff ok so now

496
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:08,090
infrastructure things

497
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:13,040
here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peering links</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay 5540</font>

498
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:15,110
again in all routers and

499
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,840
this you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have to be somewhat</font>

500
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:19,129
careful how you doing that but we've

501
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen some value we think we're going to</font>

502
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:23,660
see some<font color="#CCCCCC"> value in helping control who</font>

503
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:25,250
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> and cannot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to some appearances</font>

504
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,020
network makes you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly need</font>

505
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,110
everybody to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go there and</font>

506
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,190
paying do certain things summers like so

507
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:34,790
we'll see we'll see how that goes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

508
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:36,350
future but for now it's in a planet land

509
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:38,840
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this might be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

510
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:41,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">example of your DNS radius servers and</font>

511
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,740
it's been network seems like that it

512
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,680
should only<font color="#E5E5E5"> be accessed by people on</font>

513
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,880
your network well radius for sure unless

514
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,160
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have another appearing thing that's</font>

515
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,630
right so I mean you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get complex and</font>

516
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,220
have to take an editor's in the count

517
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,510
but let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just play simple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tune for a</font>

518
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,250
while and everybody's on your network

519
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,450
and that's the only interconnected the

520
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:00,620
other people often have to get to those

521
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:02,450
services<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

522
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,489
questions aren't any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that stuff thus</font>

523
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,490
far this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is making sense</font>

524
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,990
it's after lunch

525
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok so let's learn what multi out for a</font>

526
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,949
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> um on the edges of our network</font>

527
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,560
where we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking to</font>

528
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,070
people using bgp if we're going to be

529
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:29,220
accepting in routes from this customer

530
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:32,980
every black holing stuff on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge</font>

531
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:34,450
we've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn on multi-hop the</font>

532
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,980
reason is quite simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know by</font>

533
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,840
default the next hops got to match that

534
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,250
peer a way to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around that</font>

535
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,370
restriction is from<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihop because i</font>

536
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:44,080
don't let<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go recursive look up if</font>

537
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,979
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do this pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to see on</font>

538
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,740
the juniper routers gonna be hidden

539
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,850
route on a cisco router you'll initially

540
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">install our out but as soon as you run</font>

541
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:55,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">through your scanner it basically makes</font>

542
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:55,110
it enacted<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually inaccessible</font>

543
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,920
so which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> it don't work solo yes</font>

544
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,870
you gotta try<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop only if you want</font>

545
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work so here's the 10 some</font>

546
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:06,969
obligatory<font color="#CCCCCC"> config snippets and G knows</font>

547
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,190
where it's going to configure<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihop</font>

548
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:12,940
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the repairing session down at the</font>

549
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:14,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom it need to be multicom the two in</font>

550
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,290
the bottom examples for TTL restriction

551
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,640
I didn't add that on the top you can if

552
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,760
you'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy the pulse and go out</font>

553
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">just for the one you can even sure</font>

554
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,140
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go multiple hops you can</font>

555
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,139
do that

556
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,050
ok

557
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:33,210
now we've gotten our discard things

558
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:35,190
installed when the network we've gotten

559
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:37,890
all of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> policies our route maps</font>

560
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:39,780
applied to the network so now we've laid

561
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,280
the infrastructure for<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able to</font>

562
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,440
take her out and actually do the back

563
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,910
home we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that either from</font>

564
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,130
the black hole router the way we inject

565
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:50,120
it over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time separating from country and</font>

566
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,120
when is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to you supplies</font>

567
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay as Joe mentioned we're going to</font>

568
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,299
continue discussion now actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

569
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,910
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we're going to configure the</font>

570
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:03,918
black wire from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> diagram earlier we</font>

571
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:05,809
like so black square signifying our

572
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,910
black hole better we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inject</font>

573
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:10,520
it there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned earlier too</font>

574
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,740
we also didn't cover every conspicuous a

575
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,090
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here that I don't think</font>

576
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,059
we specifically cover but there's things

577
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:19,549
like the fact that in the diagram it's

578
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:23,240
sort of applied but it's it's a ibgp

579
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:25,129
with the rest of the backbone no I gp4 I

580
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:29,059
think obvious reasons but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

581
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:30,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">cover a couple of policies etc for the</font>

582
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:33,520
black hole route and actually injecting

583
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:33,520
information into it

584
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,879
lighten up a bit of a cold so I wanna do

585
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:41,220
my best year bug on routes now we can

586
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,800
manually inject the Vogon routes the

587
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:47,250
same way we would say other customer

588
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,870
Network routes or host routes etc and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

589
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,850
can break it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down as we just went</font>

590
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:53,550
through the stratification that could be

591
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:55,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually break it down into</font>

592
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:59,180
Martians Archie 1918

593
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:00,590
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I na</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reserved now in one hand you</font>

594
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,880
might say<font color="#CCCCCC"> well why bother in fact</font>

595
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:04,730
depending on who you talk about

596
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:07,010
semantics writers people say bogans they

597
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:10,190
mean all three<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these some people say</font>

598
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:12,200
bogans they mean just<font color="#CCCCCC"> i na reserved in</font>

599
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,060
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think though if you looking at</font>

600
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,070
other sources out there like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the red be</font>

601
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:18,200
objects that are maintained out there

602
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,490
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vogons actually applied all</font>

00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">reserved and one advantage of actually</font>

606
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,260
break and not like that you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

607
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,480
the only thing that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I know</font>

608
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:33,200
who should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be changing his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I na preserve</font>

609
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,900
the other should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be static so in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font>

610
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,160
from a dynamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint the thing</font>

611
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:41,360
you're managing is really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AI na</font>

612
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:43,160
observe so you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep that</font>

613
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,260
all internal do it all manual yourself

614
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,270
whether manually means you're actually

615
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,360
updating the list on a route server or

616
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:51,560
what I think a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people are doing</font>

617
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,879
familiar with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody familiar with</font>

618
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,080
the external<font color="#E5E5E5"> bogan mouth service out</font>

619
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,770
there you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually take the feeds</font>

620
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,850
from it today there's actually uh if in

621
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,320
the same places a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

622
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">information nanog and other mailing</font>

623
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,530
lists you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually see when i na</font>

624
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,620
actually takes a block and<font color="#E5E5E5"> allocates it</font>

625
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,639
to a registry and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point you need</font>

626
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">to actually take that out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

627
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,500
filters this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

628
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:15,000
is can be operationally intensive I mean

629
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,500
we've actually had cases where

630
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,790
we're doing a manual it's difficult to

631
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,220
go through an update<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a timely</font>

632
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,690
fashion we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually were one of the ones</font>

633
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,590
who receive one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the new block so for</font>

634
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,940
a period of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we were actually</font>

635
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,100
filtering somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> on customers</font>

636
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,290
obviously not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good thing so to</font>

637
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:32,760
automate that is obviously a big plus

638
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:36,300
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can take that feed and let them</font>

639
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:38,370
actually update your I guess knowledge

640
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,970
of what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> currently</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I na</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reserve and</font>

641
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,379
what's not

642
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,730
and that usually we are talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

643
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,650
taking an external feed from somebody

644
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,970
trading your black hole router turning

645
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,409
around and propagating attitude network

646
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,120
could drop it that usually raises the

647
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:49,919
hair on the back of our peoples neck so

648
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,989
friends talk a little bit about some

649
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,270
reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> why you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be confident that's</font>

650
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,549
our steps i guess i should say you could

651
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:58,168
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that should make everybody a little</font>

652
00:24:56,549 --> 00:25:00,059
more comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that concept so</font>

653
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:03,090
the other thing want to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

654
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:05,970
host routes this is the case where we

655
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,918
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to black hole cut either</font>

656
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,299
customers because they don't maybe

657
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,409
they're not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PTP speaking customer they</font>

658
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,658
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you built to do it</font>

659
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:14,340
themselves or we've got a case where

660
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:17,140
we've identified something from an

661
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:19,480
operational standpoint and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

662
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,340
and black hole there their address for

663
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,270
them until<font color="#E5E5E5"> they clean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up whatever you</font>

664
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,389
know

665
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:28,580
and here again this actually applies

666
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,930
probably to all route zero you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have on</font>

667
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,169
your buckle router but most definitely

668
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,940
for your customer black hole routes you

669
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:37,010
want to have a tracking mechanism we've

670
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,390
mentioned in the introduction you know

671
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,970
methods<font color="#CCCCCC"> to innovate this with your</font>

672
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,530
network management systems but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fair</font>

673
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,420
at least trouble ticketing something

674
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:47,000
else you have a way of tracking your why

675
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,080
is this black hole here a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times</font>

676
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,310
you go through a router configure

677
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,230
something like that try to figure out

678
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,639
you know where does<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACL come from why is</font>

679
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,700
it here<font color="#CCCCCC"> or you who are a customer</font>

680
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,650
interface you know can use to do that to

681
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,330
respond to DDoS attacks you see this ACL

682
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,250
in there you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's not getting</font>

683
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,980
any matches you know it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

684
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,840
complex and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have no idea how long</font>

685
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">has been there if it's still needed so</font>

686
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,530
from the standpoint of injecting routes

687
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,900
on a black hole better if you very

688
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:14,960
helpful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a way to track that find</font>

689
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:17,549
out if it's still required which goes to

690
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,470
the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> boat there the audit procedures</font>

691
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:21,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">I definitely want to have a way to</font>

692
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:24,210
actually answer that question no why is

693
00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:26,399
it there is it still required and this

694
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,870
is especially important for your dynamic

695
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:30,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">pools</font>

696
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,590
some networks have more time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tyler</font>

697
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:33,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">somewhere maybe completely sad don't</font>

698
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,800
open you definitely from a dynamic

699
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,720
standpoint you wanna<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep those cool</font>

700
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:40,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">stretch you don't want an instant</font>

701
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:43,350
customer actually connecting and getting

702
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,550
the old botnet you know IP address or

703
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,820
some other customers doin somethin fishy

704
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:50,750
they got blackboard and you have a stale

705
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,750
static route in there there's now actual

706
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,169
to those ends we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple examples</font>

707
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,169
here

708
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,090
have a couple policies here a lot of

709
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,929
this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrapped little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> corpos but</font>

710
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,870
it's just going through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the various</font>

711
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:11,550
groups that we joke previously defined

712
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:14,540
what we're getting into the various

713
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,540
categories of

714
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:20,390
black hole all

715
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,790
it's like the

716
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:24,380
okay its customers left so black hole

717
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:26,409
all we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about actually sending to</font>

718
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,030
all routers

719
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and again we've been talking about here</font>

720
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:32,160
to be you know

721
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:34,678
with whatever your a is and then you

722
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,270
know as an example 5521 and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

723
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:38,600
how we propagate the customer all and

724
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:41,990
then we go to define the rest of them

725
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,990
there's the

726
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,760
talk about actually the stratification

727
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:54,060
actually breaking it down marching<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">tanks</font>

729
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,330
that we give proper head out so on the

730
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,400
black hole router we want to actually

731
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:02,620
define this Creed list so in our route

732
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">map we can you can set them and here</font>

733
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,520
again for completeness<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got both</font>

734
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:09,070
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> junos policy language as well as</font>

735
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:12,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to expand a community list in iOS</font>

736
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:12,629
doing effectively the same thing

737
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,240
so then also the prefix lists basically

738
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,889
going through here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

739
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,660
statically defining these different

740
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:26,870
categories so we're showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here here</font>

00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,510

argument you say if you build a<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix</font>

791

list well you just took away the whole

00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:20,039
take a one-time snapshot build the

795
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">defined what all they could be the list</font>

796
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:25,799
is only to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get less so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do once and</font>

797
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:27,719
you're done and after that as they

798
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:30,090
allocate the blocks and they get removed

799
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,710
you're still protected and it's still

800
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:33,860
automatically updating all your filters

801
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:37,960
in your network so that your

802
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,959
they'll be incorrect both

803
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,139
since I wasn't really up on the slide is

804
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,210
it that kind of makes sense I hope I

805
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,970
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk through that kind of see</font>

806
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:49,010
the value there to become<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite helpful</font>

807
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,090
and it also liked<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so it helps my</font>

808
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:53,980
confidence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

809
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:53,980
actually give you feed it still<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

810
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:59,140
so here again this is a

811
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:01,380
another Campo the prefix lists finding

812
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:02,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">out what they are for those</font>

813
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,940
no Billy the differences<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might get</font>

814
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,890
help with it

815
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,420
sample there but these are all defined

816
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,240
like I said that there's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font>

817
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,040
be objects

818
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,250
that's a method using to gather the

819
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,250
information

820
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,120
so some examples of the policy is

821
00:31:17,899 --> 00:31:21,678
actually on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> black hole router you</font>

822
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,709
think you could set up would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be to</font>

828
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,789
actually looking for your freakish lips

829
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:41,899
we're going to find what those<font color="#CCCCCC"> Martians</font>

830

are setting your appropriate I see our

00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,450
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> as previously discussed those</font>

834
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:52,010
sponsors then Matt 16g<font color="#CCCCCC"> dropping</font>

835
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:55,810
appropriately

same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the night immunity</font>

837
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:03,219
or actually just more the same real

838
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:04,350
so in this iOS version of<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy at the</font>

839
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:07,280
bottom

840

were you simply matching on the

setting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that community</font>

842
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:21,200
the other thing to discuss briefly and

843
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:24,498
this isn't so much I guess configuration

844
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,490
on the black hole router per se but for

845
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:26,990
like I think that's a better place it

846
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:29,720
started really talking about accepting

847
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:32,210
customer Ralph the black hole since

848
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,559
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to actually what we</font>

849
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:35,480
could like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this case is where</font>

850
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:38,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're not a bgp customer we could go</font>

851
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:39,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">in there enter the static route on</font>

852
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:41,719
behalf of customers actually black hole

853
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,519
space in response to whatever attack you

854
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,440
may be experiencing what we may also

855
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,120
want to allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BTW speaking</font>

856
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,110
customers the ability to actually do

857
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,110
this for themselves

858
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,390
you may or may not already have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the EVP</font>

860
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,510
covered earlier so this is one place

861
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">where I think people may have first one</font>

862
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:02,490
end of this when i went to go turn on

863
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:04,350
the customer edge black bull riding

864
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:07,350
discovered you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know actually might need</font>

00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:09,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-hop on that case it may not have</font>

866
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,649
been as obvious internal to your

867
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:13,020
infrastructure unless you're doing

868
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:15,360
something like using private

869
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,950
perhaps segregate services out maybe all

870
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,600
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> DSL broadband services you make</font>

871
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we should have them actually a</font>

separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> aes</font>

873
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,610
yeah other telcos may have run into the

874
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,169
GSP model on though

875
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:28,059
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means anybody in here but</font>

876
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,820
then there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a time in day and age</font>

877
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:32,049
when telcos actually because regulatory

878
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,090
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually had their networks</font>

879
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:35,530
actually configured in these new female

880
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:38,949
multiple

881
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:40,990
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> asns and so we then move to a</font>

882
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,910
common backbone and you're actually feel

883
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,440
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a company just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like sucked up many</font>

884
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:45,370
different networks you've got to deal

885
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the fact that some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

887
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,639
there is the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of one making sure</font>

888
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,980
your policy includes<font color="#CCCCCC"> even you can mold</font>

889
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,500
at have but this is definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

890
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:00,650
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers so the idea here</font>

891
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,870
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually to set up a policy to give</font>

892
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:05,210
the customer this autonomy basically

893
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:07,129
controls on destiny subscreen but you

894
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,230
also want to protect your customers from

895
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,429
each other so first and foremost the

896
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:12,050
thing you want to do is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> force going</font>

897
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:13,700
to be to keep your festering from

898
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,620
platform pulling other people browse and

899
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:18,529
what you do that tip please<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just</font>

900
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,120
have a prefix list<font color="#E5E5E5"> inbound to match on</font>

901
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,970
whatever he is<font color="#E5E5E5"> are already agreed to</font>

902
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,589
announce to you and in many cases best

903
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:26,000
practices most providers more than

904
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,100
likely are actually already feeling that

905
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,570
the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing they may not perhaps be</font>

906
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,520
doing is depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what your</font>

907
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,840
aggregation rules are you may have

908
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,270
prefix list in place that are actually

909
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:37,100
only accepting its major routes

910
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:38,000

00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:53,650
engineering like it

918
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:55,480
announcing longer prefixes you may

919
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:58,070
actually have that range set up to allow

920
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:01,160
maybe the<font color="#CCCCCC"> / 20 up</font>

to be to actually match on unknown

00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,759
community that's going to be as

934

mechanism for actually communicating

that community on a route you're going

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,569
to actually then take that propagate it

out the rest of network actually black

stratification there you can give him

the ability to say hey I want to

946

which is great for him cheering and

987
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,520
internally right and so you take away

like for your peers it's maybe just an

00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:33,170
additional safeguard if you are

we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that none of the</font>

1092
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,029
stuff you're propagating especially if

it's like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 address space or any</font>

other kind of bad bad prefixes you can

00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:50,040
actually take<font color="#E5E5E5"> an additional step 2 at</font>

community at your peers this is

1098
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:56,190
important especially like i said if

1099
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,540
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to deal with the scenario</font>

1100
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:00,180
where you've got multiple a<font color="#CCCCCC"> SS in your</font>

1101
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:02,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual network you can't use a no export</font>

1102
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,569
right because the whole idea is you want

1103
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:06,270
propagate this to your whole network you

1104
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:08,130
got to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> across a s</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> boundaries in your</font>

1105
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,990
network so you can't attack the route

1106
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:11,370
like that in some<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases there's been</font>

1107
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,629
some recommendations and just attack

1108
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:15,029
with no export we're certainly an option

1109
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:17,790
if you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single is</font>

1110
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:18,930
but if you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said have no place to</font>

1111
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:21,390
network

1112
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:23,160
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> around that is obvious that with</font>

1113
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:24,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">your own kill community so that you can</font>

1114
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,509
be

00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:30,400
you doubly sure that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

propagate any trash outfit

1117
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:47,810
so one other use<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this uh that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1118
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:50,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">has been covered in some other forms but</font>

1119
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:53,810
one that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's probably some</font>

1120
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:55,430
debate on whether or not though I guess

1121
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,509
how useful it is so take it for what

1122
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:58,250
it's worth but it's kind of an

1123
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:00,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting application of this where</font>

1124
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:02,420
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same mechanisms</font>

1125
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,850
the black holing information to actually

1126
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:06,080
drop based on source right so so far

1127
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,509
we've been talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> all about dropping</font>

1128
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,890
packets based on destination address<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1129
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so it's something hacker comes in</font>

1130
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:13,100
destined to a given address you know it

1131
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">looks it up a round table he says I'll</font>

1132
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,810
fill it to null 0 and you kill it but

1133
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:19,400
you can also actually use this same

1134
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:21,170
mechanism to drop traffic based on

1135
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,870
source address so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:28,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">packets coming in your network that are</font>

00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:41,109
on the unicast RPF or IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> verify source</font>

1142
00:43:38,589 --> 00:43:43,808
or whatever your vendors terminology is

1143
00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:44,799
for basically verifying that theme when

1144
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:47,529
the package received want to give an

1145
00:43:44,799 --> 00:43:49,420
interface checking the source<font color="#CCCCCC"> address it</font>

1146
00:43:47,529 --> 00:43:51,339
then looks a knob table says what route

1147
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,779
might look of a route that source

1148
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:55,328
address what I send it back out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

1149
00:43:52,779 --> 00:43:56,680
interface if yes except if not this

1150
00:43:55,329 --> 00:43:59,400
point right it's the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of</font>

1151
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">munich srp okay so</font>

1152
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,299
the next step would then be to have a

1153
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:05,190
lot to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a router treat a black hole</font>

1154
00:44:03,299 --> 00:44:07,619
out or a route look up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> no zero fee</font>

1155
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:08,940
invalid the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I wouldn't</font>

1156
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:10,619
send out that interface or no I don't

1157
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">have around so when you actually</font>

1158
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:14,880
propagate the black hole routes out

1159
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,859
there to your infrastructure and then

1160
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,859
you have won your interface is actually

1161
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:20,859
upstream of your cord have the RPF check

1162
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:23,470
turned on

1163
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:26,730
as shown here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the interface with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1164
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:29,259

1165
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:32,470
it's then going to attempt to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

1166
00:44:29,259 --> 00:44:35,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">upon the source so one way to see this</font>

1167
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:37,089
and also if you're configuring to check

1168
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,339
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see what's happening with you can</font>

1169
00:44:37,089 --> 00:44:44,589
actually debug I PCF drop verify

1170
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:46,538
although that's word<font color="#E5E5E5"> keyword right here</font>

1171
00:44:44,589 --> 00:44:48,910
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is iOS dependent i think in the</font>

1172
00:44:46,539 --> 00:44:50,079
middle of doing this change iOS version

1173
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:52,480
i think it might have been in some cases

1174
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,099
of our PDF so it's it's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1175
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,049
iteration of that RPF or verify or

1176
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:58,089
something that should hopefully be what

1177
00:44:56,049 --> 00:44:59,440
could be obvious but to compare the

1178
00:44:58,089 --> 00:45:01,599
debug command and you actually be able

1179
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:06,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see in this case packets are coming</font>

1180
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:09,489
into a valid valid address but they were

1181
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:10,869
sourced from one thing 701 since a black

1182
00:45:09,489 --> 00:45:14,829
hole router<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually propagating</font>

1183
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:18,640
that prefix as a black hole route<font color="#CCCCCC"> ie to</font>

1184
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:21,960
null 0<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually failing the RPF check</font>

1185
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:24,060
so like I said you were actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

1186
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,750
like all mechanisms<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually grow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1187
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,750
based on source that goes

1188
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:33,869
any questions on

1189
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,869
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw anybody using this by chance</font>

1190
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:45,509
it's generally something<font color="#E5E5E5"> bogus I mean I</font>

1191
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,010
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we first are looking at some</font>

1192
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:50,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this there were some questions</font>

1193
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:51,330
whether or not you know what is why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1194
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:53,640
was kind of losing to what the value

1195
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:55,470
would be in action turning is on

1196
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,000
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how much filtering you have</font>

1197

in the rest of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network right you</font>

1198
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,720
know depending on how much you've

00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:03,540
deployed<font color="#CCCCCC"> against RPF at your edge for</font>

00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,890
your customers right then nope no Custer

00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,630
if you got our communicator forget

1202
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:09,029
turned on for your edge none of your

right<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously they're not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1206
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,560
you've got very spoke as if you're

00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:19,560
peering edge that don't allow any

1208
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:22,110
traffic source from that then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tribe</font>

1209
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:26,640
wouldn't get in there anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> but without</font>

1210
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:30,120
starting a whole nother nana ish thread

on you know whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or not it is or is</font>

1212
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,710
not difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this on multi-home</font>

customers if you have for whatever

reason chose not to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">reason that may be a hole right that</font>

1216
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,240
maybe hole where your dedicated internet

1217
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,220
access customers your PGP customers

1218
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,439
whatever may not have that turned on and

1219
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:48,990
I mean they're just vulnerable as the

1220
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:51,300
next guy right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they have machines</font>

1221
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:52,649
that may be owned may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something on</font>

1222
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:55,440
it that's actually spewing this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1223
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:58,530
trash out there and this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be one</font>

1224
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,090
way so inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network to protect</font>

1225
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:01,990
yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get this whole you get</font>

1226
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:05,170
your appearing engineer

1227
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:07,410
edge maybe your you know broadband tight

1228
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:09,490
customers which is what has this this

1229
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:11,529
middle area where other dedicated

1230
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:12,520
customers could actually spewing people

1231
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:14,470
in your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to be one way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1232
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:18,250
get it off and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since you're doing</font>

1233
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:20,230
this on here again the black hole router

1234
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:23,020
basis<font color="#CCCCCC"> its dynamic rate it updates</font>

1235
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:25,510
automatically so somebody was viewing

1236
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:28,570
from something something not as obvious

1237
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:30,880
is that space but it's AI na<font color="#CCCCCC"> reserved</font>

1238
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:32,500
space then you would obviously be

1239
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,060
keeping your unique as our gift<font color="#CCCCCC"> chicks</font>

1240
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:37,170
up to date because it's all black hole

1241
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,170
set up a<font color="#CCCCCC"> CLS</font>

1242
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,200
so another common question for me

1243
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:54,150
okay so now we've moved well under this

1244
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,819
discussion to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> disc our</font>

1245
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:58,770
options are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about how we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

1246
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:00,180
out to all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers our network map</font>

1247
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:02,100
the grounds of black communities take

1248
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:04,200
appropriate action<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1249
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,700
injecting accepting them so we're up in

1250
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:08,759
line we're running never<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to talk</font>

1251
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:10,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what kind of days is providing us</font>

1252
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,380
how we track them what we're black

1253
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:15,990
polling that those<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of things so to</font>

1254
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:17,430
see what's being black hold you can

1255
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:18,660
obviously look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a round table that's</font>

1256
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:20,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty obvious if you know your next</font>

1257
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:22,830
hops just looking about table see what's

1258
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:26,160
going to your black hole destinations

1259
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:28,920
but you can also use<font color="#CCCCCC"> some other methods</font>

1260
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,899
to help you count how many packs are

1261
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,830
being black hole maybe look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1262
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,900
packet headers get some other

1263
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:35,078
intelligence from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trap that's</font>

1264
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,390
actually being thoughtful

1265
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:39,309
and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those methods are things</font>

1266
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:40,808
such as outbound filters you can

1267
00:48:39,309 --> 00:48:42,729
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly on plug when you just write</font>

1268
00:48:40,809 --> 00:48:45,130
interface so that you can actually count

1269
00:48:42,729 --> 00:48:48,149
the packets actually do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1270
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,150
came with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a firewall filter</font>

1271
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:53,279
logging syslog

1272
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:54,869
I'll leave it to Joe to actually talk

1273
00:48:53,279 --> 00:48:56,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">about those in detail especially any</font>

1274
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:58,410
potential performance in fact she may

1275
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,949
get from doing that but if it's

1276
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:03,779
configured correctly<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong if you do</font>

1277
00:49:01,949 --> 00:49:05,130
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> correctly destination addresses all</font>

1278
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:06,359
correctly it's important logic you

1279
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,760
really shouldn't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> control hit I</font>

1280
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:09,500
think turning it on

1281
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,440
should they get a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information</font>

1282
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:14,510
right off the router if you are limited

1283
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to only that sources make as opposed to</font>

1284
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:18,920
say offloading<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1285
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,000
some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of simple analysis</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1286
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,070
something like that which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1287
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,080
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of skillful we're talking</font>

1288
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:26,030
about today but

1289
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:28,170
and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also have sampling</font>

1290
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:29,339
where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically get float idea</font>

1291
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:31,740
which may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be enough to help characterize</font>

1292
00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:34,220
the attack and perhaps take other

1293
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:34,220
actions

1294
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:40,420
so taking a look here<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some sample</font>

1295
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:43,150
flow output this also shows potentially

1296
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:46,060
the value of having multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> next hop</font>

1297
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:47,200
IPS Joe showed the value on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Juniper</font>

1298
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:50,170
router having a multiple diskpart

1299
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,930
interfaces<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco only has the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> concept</font>

1300
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:54,640
for the one knows their interface but

1301
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:56,200
with using multiple next hop by Pete you

1302
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,089
still can potentially glean some

1303
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,330
information by having that granular

1304
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:02,860
level configured because it actually

1305
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:05,740
show up in your flow data and you can

1306
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:07,120
see here in this case when we look the

1307
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:10,330
flow data we actually see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah the</font>

1308
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:13,170
destination interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> is null 0 but we</font>

1309
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:15,509
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually pick up the destination IP</font>

1310
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:18,520
so if you want to glean information

1311
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:20,320
based on destination IP you in your

1312
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,880
piping clue you know pull out certain

1313
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,700
kinds of information from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your flow data</font>

1314
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,080
you can pick and choose what kind of

1315
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:28,359
traffic you looking for based on IP

1316
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:31,019
address destination on<font color="#E5E5E5"> theater</font>

1317
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:32,950
and also you get all the typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow</font>

1318
00:50:31,019 --> 00:50:35,859
informations will and you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> also be</font>

1319
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:37,779
of course exporting all this flow data

1320
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:39,970
to some other external system you know

1321
00:50:37,779 --> 00:50:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">harbour or something else that's helping</font>

1322
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:44,640
you track attacks and what's going on

1323
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:50,549
and to finish discussing the discard

1324
00:50:48,819 --> 00:50:53,849
interface stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm finna back of a joke</font>

1325
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:53,849
why there's no

1326
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:03,320
okay so here's what I'm calling it's

1327
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:05,570
simple filter mainly from a perspective

1328
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:07,420
of you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discard interface you</font>

1329
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:09,950
have a little destination which is cool

1330
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:12,260
but because it's a singular interface we

1331
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:14,410
get a singular spot to apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> filter now</font>

1332
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:17,660
you get one and that's it who knows

1333
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:19,970
excuse me so the bottom line here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

1334
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:21,680
definition of my filter don't have any

1335
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:23,149
match criteria it's what all possible

1336
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,100
thing is getting forward to the discard

1337
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:26,720
interface regardless of next hop we're

1338
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:28,940
going to be interment incrementing

1339
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:32,120
pardoning<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one counter being sampled</font>

1340
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:34,880
and then paint this product<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that's</font>

1341
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:36,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool but doesn't give you a lot of</font>

1342
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:38,720
visibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the singular</font>

1343
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,940
nature of the filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the one counter</font>

1344
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:44,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">I had that's it things are being black</font>

1345
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:47,230
hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo</font>

1346
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:48,490
to take this a step further requires a

1347
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:50,560
little bit more effort a little bit more

1348
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:52,270
configuration in pieces but gives you a

1349
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,890
lot more visibility we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1350
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:56,680
doing is using destination class you

1351
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:58,180
search for DC you so what this is is

1352
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:59,440
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a policy that</font>

1353
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:01,870
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to apply to your forwarding</font>

1354
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,180
table that's going to match your<font color="#CCCCCC"> EGP</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">communities for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> black holes to a</font>

1356
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:10,149
destination class you define what that

1357
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:12,160
allows you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do then and your filter is</font>

1358
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:14,290
have a match criteria on that

1359
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:17,049
destination class and then have some

1360
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:21,580
actions so the end result is we're going

1361
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:23,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have individual counters pardon me /</font>

1362

destination class so every individual

1363

00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:28,090
separate counter<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now I can see how</font>

1373
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:49,990
similarly because you know you saw our

you know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

1377
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:57,190

your policy apply to the 40 table as an

hole router in this case and

1394
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:35,120
my two counters in reality i'd have a

holistic on

1396
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,130
so

1397
00:53:39,369 --> 00:53:44,650
first off we very much welcome feedback

00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:46,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's already been through a couple tears</font>

1399
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:48,549
we have out there if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff feel</font>

1400
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:51,220
free now or in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future says you know</font>

1401
00:53:48,549 --> 00:53:56,970
whatever we're happy to take whatever

1402
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:56,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">you got and kind of grown questions</font>

1403
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:02,490
I got back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slides one to Jack</font>

1404
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:09,950
yeah they<font color="#E5E5E5"> SAT through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the back to slice</font>

1405
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,950
one more

1406
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:15,680
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> a particular or just</font>

1407
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,569
what

1408
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,569
anything else yes sir

1409
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:25,280
yes

1410
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:32,800
all the wings take down the question was

1411
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:35,250
how often we actually do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 10 day</font>

1412
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,250
to day basis

1413
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">check your house part of that the as you</font>

1414
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:47,890
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine to get up present on this</font>

1415
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:50,288
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing took some approval this</font>

1416
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:53,469
was kind of be representative only

1417
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:56,079
I don't know if I can actually responded

1418
00:54:53,469 --> 00:54:57,999
that he quite honest I mean I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure of</font>

1419
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,949
any buddies out there funny<font color="#CCCCCC"> dos attacks</font>

1420
00:54:57,999 --> 00:55:01,868
you know that mean you're basically

1421
00:54:59,949 --> 00:55:04,539
daily occurrence of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of traffic</font>

1422
00:55:01,869 --> 00:55:08,439
and the need to do it is on a daily or

1423
00:55:04,539 --> 00:55:09,609
more basis so you know any any tool that

1424
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:13,629
you can deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> that allows you to</font>

1425
00:55:09,609 --> 00:55:15,810
respond bachelor is going to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

1426
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:17,760
benefit so

1427
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:20,460
that wasn't completely useless but I

1428
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:23,099
don't know if I can you know details

1429
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:25,789
that too much sorry

1430
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:25,789
what else

1431
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:37,990
the wood<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question what has been the</font>

1433
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:43,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">I guess on the method of which we</font>

1434
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:45,640
received<font color="#E5E5E5"> the request or the determine</font>

1435
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:47,860
the needs of black hole so I mean it's

1436
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,779
as far as propagation I mean as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as</font>

1437
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:52,080
you make that decision that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you</font>

1438
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:54,940
know on average like five minutes we

1439
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:58,330
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of propagates you know an installer</font>

1440
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,560
out it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty dark back so and it also</font>

1441
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:02,230
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the nature of attack some</font>

1442
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:06,130
cases you know if you're black on a

1443
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:08,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">customer's / 32 route you know the</font>

1444
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:11,680
effect of the relief is almost

1445
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:14,080
instantaneous if you're attempting to be

1446
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,930
part of the greater good and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

destroy a botnet it's often<font color="#CCCCCC"> unclear</font>

1448
00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:21,870
really is too how much effect you may or

1449
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:21,870
may not have had

1450
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,120
we said of curiosity I think I answers

1451
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:27,650
one performance appears I didn't Alan

1452
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,690
saw a couple hands may be shy to answer

1453
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:31,130
but how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people actually deployed</font>

1454
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:33,890
actually black rhino the<font color="#E5E5E5"> least two</font>

1455
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:37,580
people in here that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing at</font>

1456
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:38,960
various ways check furiosa t anybody

1457
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:40,790
care to comment on their platform for

1458
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,990
what they're using the black as a black

1459

hole bladder with<font color="#CCCCCC"> even they actually</font>

1460
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:44,979
inject around

1461
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:52,530
I mean you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do it everything from say</font>

1462
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:55,140
a 7206 or onesie

1463
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:56,610
it doesn't take much really but

1464
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:58,350
preferably something a little reliable

1465
00:56:56,610 --> 00:57:00,000
if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that reliable perhaps if</font>

1466
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:01,529
it's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router in a different</font>

1467
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,340
location because of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember your</font>

1468
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:08,010
router blows up all your all your

1469
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:11,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">announcements go away and in you know</font>

1470
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:11,300
everything's flying and it's scary

1471
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:33,200
ok the question was<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what's the take</font>

1472
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:35,029
rate how are the acceptance rate of by

1473
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,000
the demand for the capability to do the

1474
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:40,940
customer edge black holing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

1475
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:44,630
say it's relatively great I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1476
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:46,370
almost any time you get a request<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an</font>

1477
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:49,010
ACL to block an attack you can burn<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

1478
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:50,680
to equate that to you know the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

1479
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:53,120
to do the customer edge<font color="#E5E5E5"> bell rings so</font>

1480
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,379
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can put the customer and</font>

1481
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,460
charge that because the one of the

1482
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:56,780
biggest frustration of course they have

1483
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:58,550
is they'll complain about how long<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1484
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:00,530
took to get you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hold somebody with</font>

1485
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:02,450
clue you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to put in the</font>

1486
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:06,410
right ACL as opposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know</font>

1487
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:09,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an IP any any problems</font>

1488
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:11,549
off so yeah

1489
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,300
and I see somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> the door I think it's</font>

1490
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:14,300
doing a lot of this already

1491
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:35,819
okay so the question if I heard it all

1492
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:37,230
that correctly is what precautions do we

1493
00:58:35,819 --> 00:58:41,480
take to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure the black hole router</font>

1494
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:41,480
is not abused is it a good summary

1495
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:05,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the question again I guess is how</font>

1496
00:59:04,059 --> 00:59:06,999
do you protect the black hole<font color="#CCCCCC"> writer</font>

1497
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,579
from doing something like black hole in

1498
00:59:06,999 --> 00:59:12,069
your own DNS infrastructure yeah and I

1499
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:13,900
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> you mean by somebody ekström to</font>

1500
00:59:12,069 --> 00:59:14,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">you like your operation staff who didn't</font>

1501
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,119
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mistake you're talking about</font>

1502
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:19,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">somebody who's intentionally trying to</font>

1503
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:21,670
do this well in order to well first of

1504
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,930
all the black hole router one thing we

1505
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:25,180
didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover up here is that the</font>

1506
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:26,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">the policies on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> round are such that you</font>

1507
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:30,009
don't accept routes and blackwell writer

1508
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:31,779
from anybody except for potentially

1509
00:59:30,009 --> 00:59:33,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">routes you're sifting from an external</font>

1510
00:59:31,779 --> 00:59:35,529
go ghana out server and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1511
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:38,499
aesthetically find exactly what rot

1512
00:59:35,529 --> 00:59:40,390
you're going to take and you don't you

1513
00:59:38,499 --> 00:59:42,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't even accept routes from your own</font>

1514
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:43,690
internal infrastructure right there's no

1515
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,309
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to there's no if there's no need to</font>

1516
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:47,739
accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> any routes in from your</font>

1517
00:59:45,309 --> 00:59:50,349
infrastructure so there's really no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

1518
00:59:47,739 --> 00:59:53,140
to inject a route into the black hole

1519
00:59:50,349 --> 00:59:55,539
router other than to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually be on the</font>

1520
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:57,879
router compromiser<font color="#E5E5E5"> out ourselves in our</font>

1521
00:59:55,539 --> 01:00:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">set of grout with the right mechanisms</font>

1522
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:03,279
right to get it to inject or as the

1523
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:05,640
other scenario i mentioned to compromise

1524
01:00:03,279 --> 01:00:08,739
the external like both are not server

1525
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,699
which granted maybe a lot bang for the

1526
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:11,109
buck right because you can do that

1527
01:00:09,699 --> 01:00:13,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to get everybody who's</font>

1528
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:16,180
using them the system but like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said</font>

1529
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:17,469
hopefully you know people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are taking</font>

1530
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:19,899
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own precautions like i mentioned</font>

1531
01:00:17,469 --> 01:00:22,299
so that the book on route server is not

1532
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:25,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">capable of sending you anything or going</font>

1533
01:00:22,299 --> 01:00:27,009
to rephrase that you are not accepting

1534
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:29,529
anything for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> book i'm not server</font>

1535
01:00:27,009 --> 01:00:30,560
other than what you explicitly say you

1536
01:00:29,529 --> 01:00:32,680
want

1537
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:36,710
and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said because I list is static</font>

1538
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:38,660
you know it's only decreasing what the

1539
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:41,060
value of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is that the routes are only</font>

1540
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:43,460
being removed as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> na reserve blocks</font>

1541
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:45,290
get allocated so you take your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1542
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:46,370
one-time shot say this is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going</font>

1543
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:48,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to except from that guy and that's it</font>

1544
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:51,490
and you're effectively protected but

1545
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:51,490
also again the benefit to

1546
01:00:52,539 --> 01:00:57,359
I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> covers everything I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

1547
01:00:54,249 --> 01:00:57,359
think of is that entry bush

1548
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:12,160
right so so so things on that so things

1549
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:14,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the end right you're inbound right</font>

1550
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:17,649
natural policies only allowing routes

1551
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:18,730
from their allocated space<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so they</font>

1552
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:20,710
shouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a route</font>

1553
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:22,960
that matches your<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS server they've got</font>

1554
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:24,819
policies<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put this correctly okay and</font>

1555
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,920
in addition it also restricts what can

1556
01:01:24,819 --> 01:01:28,450
use a consent<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you try to lock</font>

1557
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:32,339
them in as best you can so that they can

1558
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:32,339
only harm themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1559
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:46,810
ok

1560
01:01:56,950 --> 01:02:00,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so the question had to do it we're</font>

1561
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,099
injecting routes where customer

1562
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:05,169
customers not the end state the end

1563
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:07,270
network they're actually a transit up

1564
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:09,579
for somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else ok so we're concerned</font>

1565
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:14,250
about black hauling stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> it only gets</font>

1566
01:02:09,579 --> 01:02:14,250
to the edge of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

1567
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,470
and that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise in the works okay</font>

1568
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:20,730
okay yeah okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah so that would</font>

1569
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:21,930
that wouldn't be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy you know so</font>

1570
01:02:20,730 --> 01:02:24,210
you have ended on policy to accept the

1571
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:26,160
black hole stuff scrubbing or taking

1572
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:28,829
some action on the outside remove those

1573
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,359
and conversely like while I'm thinking

1574
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:31,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that i'm peering sites that's kind</font>

1575
01:02:30,359 --> 01:02:32,819
of go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it when you were saying</font>

1576
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">you would have policies that wouldn't</font>

1577
01:02:32,819 --> 01:02:35,980
accept routes<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they need to fly</font>

1578
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,600
polka music you know

1579
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:39,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so that will keep them coming in</font>

1580
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,868
through here

1581
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:44,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">that puts your free customers</font>

1582
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,779
now yes follow

1583
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,759
right

1584
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:02,510
I

1585
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:06,750
yes yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I mean you're you're</font>

1586
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,890
using me to write a napper policy all

1587
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:12,860
the tools that are available to that or

1588
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:12,859
available to you do that make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1589
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:28,410
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have any had a</font>

1590
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:31,309
discussion with anybody else about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

1591
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:31,308
cooperative in regard

1592
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:39,610
ok passed between themselves

1593
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:45,050
r is more open

1594
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:12,400
yes sorry

1595
01:04:18,299 --> 01:04:23,788
what I ok so it had to do with configure

1596
01:04:21,299 --> 01:04:24,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">a static route putting reject on it the</font>

1597
01:04:23,789 --> 01:04:27,269
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to do that for myself</font>

1598
01:04:24,809 --> 01:04:31,439
is that generates a lot of internal

1599
01:04:27,269 --> 01:04:33,479
traffic on my router and is harmful to

1600
01:04:31,439 --> 01:04:35,038
me regardless of what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does somebody</font>

1601
01:04:33,479 --> 01:04:37,308
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> could send me back those I think</font>

1602
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font>

1603
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:49,110
oh I wouldn't I would it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just it was</font>

1604
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:52,460
just there to say hey keep this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind</font>

1605
01:04:49,110 --> 01:04:52,460
ok there's my people

1606
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:10,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would say no</font>

1607
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:13,060
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't know if</font>

1608
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:14,950
yours I think of iteration of that the

1609
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:17,799
question was if the customer that got a

1610
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:20,109
/ 20 sign and he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only using a / 24 out</font>

1611
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,310
of it should he only should he announced

1612
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:24,820
the / 22 you<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the black hole</font>

1613
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:26,620
community to me i would actually if

1614
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:28,060
understand the scenario you're ascribing

1615
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:30,580
I don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cara that is passing the</font>

1616
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:32,560
buck in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense of you know you should</font>

1617
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:33,580
do your own bitbucket routing from the

1618
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">standpoint right you know a special</font>

1619
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:37,509
package right i mean you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should have</font>

1620
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:39,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">your own no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 so that you know you you</font>

1621
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:42,910
know if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not using it it's your</font>

1622
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:44,649
block let it come in and throw it away<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1623
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:47,549
think it would probably be somewhat

1624
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:47,550
things that gets to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1625
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,580
ok

1626
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:20,150
so

1627
01:06:28,510 --> 01:06:33,310
okay said everybody r that I think what

1628
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:35,020
Chris was saying was actually passing

1629
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:36,520
the garbage collection off to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1630
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:38,410
bigger pipe backbone if i'm

1631
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:40,030
characterized name correctly right so

1632
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:43,990
that basically the customers announcing

1633
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:46,300
as he described his larger block with a

1634
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:48,580
black hole<font color="#E5E5E5"> community so that for the</font>

1635
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:50,620
stuff that's scanning unused space

1636
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:52,120
that's within the customer block it's

1637
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:53,500
effectively getting thrown away and so

1638
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:55,390
for the blocks of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer actually</font>

1639
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,980
using in the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific route is</font>

1640
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:58,120
being propagated up in the backbone it's

1641
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:59,320
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> corrected write it down the</font>

1642
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,569
customer so the customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and actually</font>

1643
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:03,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">having to haul that garbage through his</font>

1644
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:05,970
pipes it's scanning traffic whatever it

1645
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,970
may be

1646
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:20,640
hang up

1647
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:30,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do we have an experience</font>

1648
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:34,199
integrating this with an igp cross

1649
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:34,199
not specifically

1650
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:40,319
I think there may be some out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there too</font>

1651
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:42,150
perhaps someone of the verge of doesn't

1652
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:44,520
like that like to find somebody want to

1653
01:07:42,150 --> 01:07:45,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to about that but not not</font>

1654
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,280
specifically we don't really do that

1655
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:51,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">fake the fact we specifically want to</font>

1656
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,320
keep anything like that separated

1657
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:00,609
anything else you mean will be a prawn

1658
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:03,270
if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come towers offliner by a</font>

1659
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:03,270
