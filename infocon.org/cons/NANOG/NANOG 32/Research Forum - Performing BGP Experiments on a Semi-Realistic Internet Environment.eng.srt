124
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,380
two experiments we did in this

125
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:12,219
experiment in this testified first is

126
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:14,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">the already exchanged we i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> created the</font>

similar thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the small london HP</font>

128
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:23,140
data and the second one is is related to

129
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:26,430
a job slapped a minute well physically

130
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:31,090
in our experiments we show that a hiker

131
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:34,840
can take the advantage of the jobs like

132
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:42,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">germany so he can remotely cause the</font>

133
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:44,289
router to surprise a god and because i

134
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,990
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too much time so i won't go</font>

135
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:50,110
into detail the<font color="#CCCCCC"> experiments but one</font>

136
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:52,870
thing I do want amazing is that remember

137
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:55,000
we have in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> cash prize will have the</font>

138
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:59,040
50 paise to liberal order and also the

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:04,020
some cisco routers we did the damn near

140
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:06,640
experiments on both platforms although

141
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:09,609
attack can take a fight on both

142
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,760
platforms we still find<font color="#E5E5E5"> some interesting</font>

143
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,410
things we<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually the deeper</font>

144
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,320
daughter and the fiscal order the

145
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:20,680
behavior differently when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they when we</font>

146
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:23,860
launched the same dampening attack so

147
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,370
that actually are suggested that maybe

148
