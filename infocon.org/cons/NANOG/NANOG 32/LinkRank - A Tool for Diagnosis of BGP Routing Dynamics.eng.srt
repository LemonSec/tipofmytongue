1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:07,588
thanks Craig for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the introduction this</font>

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,629
is my first nanog and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can already say</font>

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,320
that it's been much more rewarding than

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:16,619
any of the conference of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever attended</font>

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:20,520
three t-shirts to<font color="#CCCCCC"> balkans one optical</font>

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:25,380
mouse and one laptop light<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,390
proud<font color="#E5E5E5"> of myself so thanks a lot for</font>

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,279
inviting here inviting me here to talk

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,320
about my tool today I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,759
about link rank which is a tool we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,140
been developing<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the past few months</font>

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,100
actually a year and a half<font color="#E5E5E5"> two years</font>

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,890
this work started in 2002 summer of 2002

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,960
and involves dan Marci who's also here

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,610
as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Leisha who's also present in</font>

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,250
the audience we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

17
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,850
student<font color="#CCCCCC"> dimma from UCLA who's working on</font>

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,610
this so one motivation why this whole

19
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,280
work towards link rank started was was

20
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,399
stemmed from our own difficulty to

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,449
understand tons and tons of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp updates</font>

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,280
that we had accumulated and what we

23
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,200
really needed at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time was some tool</font>

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,820
that could just summarize these huge

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,729
chunks of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rate and tell us what</font>

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,189
exactly happened so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we started</font>

27
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,530
designing this tool called link rank and

28
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,750
at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we also wanted this</font>

29
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:23,009
tool to be useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to operators and in</font>

30
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,619
general people from ISPs so let's move

31
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,290
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what kind of questions can be</font>

32
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,290
answered by a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp visualization</font>

33
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,420
tool so the first thing the foremost

34
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,320
that for most question that can be

35
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:40,979
answered by a good visualization tool is

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,798
which is links are important to you now

37
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,479
most of us know who are directors are

38
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,640
and so it's not so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem</font>

39
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,679
understanding the peering without direct

40
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,750
neighbors but beyond our direct

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,579
neighbors what the picture is is not

42
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,500
very easy to understand so this is one

43
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:59,460
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the questions that can be answered by</font>

44
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,110
a good visualization tool beyond just

45
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,929
visualizing your routes you are also

46
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,329
interested in routing dynamics in

47
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,209
particular you want to know on any<font color="#E5E5E5"> given</font>

48
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,200
day what kind of routing events are

49
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:15,040
happening are they affecting your routes

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">not you also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know whether you</font>

51
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">are being affected by routing</font>

52
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,810
instability that is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than one hopper</font>

53
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:24,340
way which you cannot do much about and

54
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,160
finally for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the effects that you do</font>

55
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,519
observe you want to know whether its

56
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,660
global or its local<font color="#CCCCCC"> which in case its</font>

57
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:33,849
local you can just talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

58
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,890
neighbors and sort it out and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

59
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:40,140
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions that a</font>

60
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:40,140
good bgp visualization tool can answer

61
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,540
so in this slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to introduce</font>

62
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,459
very briefly what i mean by bgp

63
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,429
visualization so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear and we</font>

64
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:53,410
can dig into the tool in detail so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

65
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,750
graph on the right hand side is an AS

66
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,970
level graph it's a very simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> graph you</font>

67
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,150
have each node azande s and you have to

68
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:03,880
prefix is being advertised p1 and p2

69
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:06,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is how the route looks</font>

70
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,049
like at a given instant of time now what

71
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,870
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have is an update coming from your</font>

72
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:15,430
blue neighbor which we draws the path to

73
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:19,269
prefix p1 as a result your new path goes

74
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:21,040
via<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s 3 and s 5 okay so you have</font>

75
00:03:19,269 --> 00:03:23,620
another update coming in from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your red</font>

76
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,370
neighbor which now withdraws the path to

77
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:30,549
p1 so a new path there is no new path

78
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:32,290
and finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a third update</font>

79
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:34,060
coming from the same neighbor which

80
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,959
withdraws up which changes the path for

81
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:41,380
p2 and so a new part now becomes s 3 6 &

82
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,030
7 so this is and the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

83
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,880
visualization that I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at here</font>

84
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,920
the only difference is that it's at a

85
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,510
much larger scale when we are talking

86
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three updates it's very easy to</font>

87
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:54,849
just draw it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and lay it out but in</font>

88
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,970
reality visualization presents many many

89
00:03:54,849 --> 00:04:01,388
challenges and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at what kind of</font>

90
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,579
challenges we are facing we list them in

91
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:06,430
three dimensions the first is

92
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:08,260
topological granularity clearly you have

93
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,690
so many s links you have so many

94
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,940
prefixes it's not easy to decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

95
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,680
which prefixes or which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> links you</font>

96
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,769
want to visualize so that's the number

97
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,108
<font color="#E5E5E5">one challenge you face the second</font>

98
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:22,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenge is the time dimension you have</font>

99
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:24,280
updates arriving and a continuous basis

100
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:27,370
you have clusters of updates you

101
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,530
period periods of<font color="#E5E5E5"> low activity so you</font>

102
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,690
want to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to decide on what's the</font>

103
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">best time to or what times are</font>

104
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,010
interesting to observe<font color="#CCCCCC"> routing dynamics</font>

105
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">over time and finally you have more than</font>

106
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,669
one views like route<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers for instance</font>

107
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,790
archives data and it has lots and lots

108
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:45,400
of viewpoints and you want to be able to

109
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:49,120
combine views to get a better picture of

110
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,429
routing besides that a sub challenge in

111
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,710
this is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> to identify which ones are</font>

112
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,389
the right ones to combine together so

113
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,120
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the challenges we face</font>

114
00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:02,860
in visualization in general and as a

115
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:05,890
first step as a first step what I'm

116
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do is just simply take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

117
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,099
simplest possible case in each of these

118
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,260
challenge and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll move on and</font>

119
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,120
make it more complicated so for

120
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,669
topological granularity you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

121
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,110
viewing all possible links for time

122
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:18,669
don't worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the whole time</font>

123
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,280
dimension just focus on a particular

124
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:24,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">instant of time similarly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for view just</font>

125
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,460
pick one pick one particular view and

126
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,640
let's look at this diagraph that we

127
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">present this diagraph is so that people</font>

128
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,940
understand the notion of link rank and

129
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,179
drank change that we used to the talk

130
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,789
and once<font color="#E5E5E5"> we move through some examples</font>

131
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,680
with this diagraph we dig<font color="#CCCCCC"> into some real</font>

132
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:45,849
examples so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can understand what</font>

133
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,550
we do so in this diagraph we assume that

134
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:52,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">each a s which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a node here hosts</font>

135
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:54,789
about 100 prefixes so link rank which is

136
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,190
defined as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the weight on these graphs on</font>

137
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:58,810
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> links is essentially the number of</font>

138
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,510
prefixes that you can reach by using

139
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:04,330
that link<font color="#CCCCCC"> for instance if you look at</font>

140
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,130
link 45 the link rank is 100 which means

141
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,229
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred prefixes using</font>

142
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,960
linq 45 which is not surprising since

143
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:14,530
link<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 is since a s5 is hosting hundred</font>

144
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,539
prefixes in contrast link 12 can reach

145
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,719
about 500 prefixes because it has

146
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:21,640
neighbors that it connects to so clearly

147
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,640
in a real case<font color="#E5E5E5"> link rank graph is going</font>

148
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:27,120
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be too big too messy and you want to</font>

149
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,190
abstract out details that make the graph

150
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,349
viewable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what we do as a first</font>

151
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,180
step is you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply a threshold to see</font>

152
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:35,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">only links of all certain usage so in</font>

153
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,470
this case for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if you</font>

154
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,389
threshold of 200 what you see is this

155
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:45,789
much smaller graph so having found a

156
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:47,350
smaller graph we still face a challenge

157
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:49,870
of what happens when we deal with

158
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,880
updates so that on the top here you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

159
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,610
receiving updates on a continuous basis

160
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,430
and assume you have 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> updates which</font>

161
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:00,940
change paths for 100<font color="#CCCCCC"> graphics is hosted</font>

162
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:03,550
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> for pious food so when you receive</font>

163
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,380
each of these updates the link rank

164
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,900
state is changing because each update is

165
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,990
changing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> path one by one now the</font>

166
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,070
challenge is when do you decide that you

167
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,400
had enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you want to visualize</font>

168
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:17,289
these changes so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not easy to know</font>

169
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,690
when to take a snapshot of the system to

170
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:22,479
visualize and one way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this</font>

171
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,969
or this is our way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this is</font>

172
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,400
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a snapshot when the running</font>

173
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:30,430
total of links that change the rank

174
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,780
change exceeds some user-defined

175
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,300
threshold so in this case if I'm

176
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,239
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in events that change links</font>

177
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,430
with weights more than 100 I can see

178
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I have the starting point and the</font>

179
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,260
ending point where finally I've seen

180
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:48,159
that 27 has changed more than 100 or 24

181
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:50,469
has lost more than hundred so this these

182
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:52,300
define my starting and ending points and

183
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,940
once I have my starting and ending

184
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,280
points I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to visualize but</font>

185
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">even in this graph if you see you have</font>

186
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,619
linked 12 which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is common to both the</font>

187
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:04,810
graphs with the same weight so if you

188
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,979
want to summarize the change and not

189
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:10,659
just the static route view we define the

190
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:13,000
notion of a rank change graph now

191
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:16,630
ranking graph is very important to

192
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,820
understand how bgp dynamics are this

193
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,949
graph captures just the difference

194
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">between the two snapshots you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taken</font>

195
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:25,509
and it eliminates links with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

196
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,859
weight or wait below<font color="#E5E5E5"> the threshold so</font>

197
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:29,289
rank change graph in this case would

198
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,300
look like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> with two kinds of links</font>

199
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:34,479
the red links which indicate loss and

200
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,430
the green links which indicate gain the

201
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,450
weights on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the links is the amount of</font>

202
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">change that has occurred</font>

203
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:45,699
so summarizing rank change<font color="#CCCCCC"> drafts show</font>

204
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:48,130
which links have changed in a given<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

205
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:52,329
interval and red indicates loss<font color="#CCCCCC"> Green</font>

206
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:55,240
indicates<font color="#E5E5E5"> game even with this you still</font>

207
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:58,180
haven't understood how to view events on

208
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,029
a time dimension so what you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

209
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,279
is some kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level plot that</font>

210
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:06,040
tells you interesting events occur at

211
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,230
this particular instant of time we tried

212
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,029
playing with update plots and we realize

213
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,449
that updates do not necessarily reflect

214
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:15,490
the amount of routing dynamics going on

215
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:18,550
so we decided we need a helper plot

216
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,110
which we call as the activity blood what

217
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,209
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> activity plot does is gives you a</font>

218
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,850
high level picture of where the

219
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:27,369
interesting routing dynamics lie now you

220
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,870
see there are some chunks of red and

221
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,050
green bars out here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll explain in a</font>

222
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:34,870
minute what they stand for but the

223
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:36,579
starting point is that wherever there is

224
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,769
a high density of red and green bars

225
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:41,258
there's a lot of activity going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so</font>

226
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:43,540
what do these red and green bars mean

227
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:46,870
looking at the same example<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

228
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,639
carried through what we do at any given

229
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,850
instant of time is just sum up all the

230
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,190
losses and plot a red bar and sum up all

231
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:57,069
the gains and plot a green bar so you

232
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,870
have this done at various points and you

233
00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:01,469
can see periods of inactivity in which

234
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:04,120
the routes have not really changed much

235
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:07,720
so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> various implications this</font>

236
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:11,319
activity plot could have the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

237
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:15,279
is you could have the green much higher

238
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:17,769
magnitude than the red and this could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

239
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,689
due to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a combination of just longer new</font>

240
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:22,300
parts like in this case for instance

241
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:24,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a longer new path or it could also</font>

242
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,740
be due to gain in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> routes</font>

243
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:28,209
it just happens that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are new round</font>

244
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">swing an ounce and so you have new green</font>

245
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:32,199
things coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a mirror image of this</font>

246
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:36,430
case is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second case in which the</font>

247
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:38,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">loss</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is much higher than the game so the</font>

248
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,138
important the interesting implication is

249
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,420
the third one where you have a bunch of

250
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:45,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">red birds now this is interesting</font>

251
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,899
because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is suggesting that routes</font>

252
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:50,199
are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost but they are not being</font>

253
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:52,329
gained so this is always<font color="#CCCCCC"> an interesting</font>

254
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:54,849
thing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> general</font>

255
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:58,238
or most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their times indicates loss of</font>

256
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:00,819
connectivity so activity plots give you

257
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:03,100
a good feel of what is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in the</font>

258
00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:05,368
network and this can be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting point</font>

259
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,889
to look at details on the network

260
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:11,649
however it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just limited to view</font>

261
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:13,600
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time-dimension often you can</font>

262
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:16,389
identify common behavior across

263
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,829
different pairs or different views by

264
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:20,049
looking at the activity<font color="#E5E5E5"> plot in this</font>

265
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:22,179
case this is from real data we've

266
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:24,579
plotted activities from various points

267
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:26,559
and I couldn't scroll down but there are

268
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:28,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">many other points which we use in which</font>

269
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,368
have similar behavior you can see

270
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:33,429
towards the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the plot there's a</font>

271
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:36,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of activity a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of views shows</font>

272
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:39,670
similar activity which is to bars and

273
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:41,920
this can help you not only understand

274
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:45,179
that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a global routing dynamics</font>

275
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:50,139
going on but also to identify common

276
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:53,649
views which share a<font color="#E5E5E5"> common behavior</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

277
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:56,170
so now with this we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to dig</font>

278
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:58,029
into some real case studies and look at

279
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:04,719
the link<font color="#E5E5E5"> rank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to we'll see how it can</font>

280
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:06,579
help us the first case study we observed

281
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,499
from our activity plot there was some

282
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:11,498
high amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of activity going on one of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> or one of the viewpoints that</font>

00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:15,970
we have this data is from<font color="#CCCCCC"> route views</font>

285
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:19,480
there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> timeline at the bottom right</font>

286
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,980
which shows when this data is from the

00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,419
blue note indicates the point of

288

stands for Los green stands for gain the

290
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:35,439

<font color="#E5E5E5">loss and the corresponding gain and so</font>

292
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:41,529
forth the activity graph shows down here

293
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:43,629
there is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of activity going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and</font>

294
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:45,790
we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see what exactly this</font>

295
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:48,459
hundreds and thousands of updates have

296
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:50,410
done so we have some controls here which

297
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:52,029
can which can move you through the

298
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:57,639
activity graph I'm going to step one<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

299
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:59,949
a time we see now<font color="#E5E5E5"> between this two there</font>

300
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:02,350
was a loss and then right after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

301
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:05,378
there was again within five or six

302
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:11,169
minutes then there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a loss again</font>

303
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:14,589
again again loss gain this kept

304
00:13:11,169 --> 00:13:17,160
repeating alternately and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally</font>

305
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:22,449
things settled around here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> did they</font>

306
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:27,129
because when we move it out to this

307
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:29,949
section you can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the similar</font>

308
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:32,439
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> loss gain compensation still</font>

309
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:35,649
carries out and it's not over even here

310
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:39,998
even here it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> story but it's</font>

311
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:41,829
just more spaced out now so this kind of

312
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:44,589
visualization gives you a good feel of

313
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:46,118
what is happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this hundreds of</font>

314
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:51,999
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of updates that you observe it</font>

315
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:53,829
these monitoring points<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's one</font>

316
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:56,049
way of using<font color="#E5E5E5"> linq rank is you just have</font>

317
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:58,929
one monitoring point and you see what is

318
00:13:56,049 --> 00:14:00,970
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that monitoring point the</font>

319
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:04,449
second case study focuses on how you can

320
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:06,519
use link rank to make some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

321
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:07,929
inference now the tool does not do

322
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,019
inference on its own but you can use

323
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:13,749
this tool and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> common sense to do</font>

324
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:15,249
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of influence what i call this</font>

325
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:17,139
is influenced<font color="#E5E5E5"> by choosing relevant</font>

326
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:20,139
fusion it will be clear in a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

327
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:23,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">minutes what i mean by relevant this is</font>

328
00:14:20,139 --> 00:14:25,179
a graph that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we observed from 3130 again</font>

329
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:27,399
the timeline is<font color="#E5E5E5"> july sometime which is</font>

330
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:29,619
pretty recent the blue node is the point

331
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:32,470
of observation notice there are two

332
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:35,559
nodes with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> color orange and these</font>

333
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:37,809
nodes are nodes that have views in your

334
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:39,608
data so these are points you can

335
00:14:37,809 --> 00:14:40,959
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> view changes from or review</font>

336
00:14:39,609 --> 00:14:43,209
routes from and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's interesting</font>

337
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,268
because now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see that there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a loss</font>

338
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:49,618
along the path through 2914 and there is

339
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:52,659
again along<font color="#CCCCCC"> the path through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1239 and</font>

340
00:14:49,619 --> 00:14:55,749
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what has caused this</font>

341
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:58,089
route change or these 250 odd prefixes

342
00:14:55,749 --> 00:15:00,609
to move from the red part to the green

343
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:03,159
earth so how do you do that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

344
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:04,959
lucky enough in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have two</font>

345
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:08,169
observation points on your lost as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

346
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,508
as gained path so you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 2914</font>

347
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:12,609
to see whether 2914 is seeing any

348
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:14,859
changes if it is seeing any changes then

349
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:17,739
most likely the problem lies beyond 2914

350
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:18,520
and so forth so looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2914 in the</font>

351
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:22,540
same

352
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:25,750
interval we see that it has changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

353
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:29,020
it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have changes towards 1299 it</font>

354
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:33,340
has changes towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> an es6 395 which is</font>

355
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:35,199
an unrelated possibly unrelated event so

356
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:38,260
what's the other cause of this route

357
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,900
change things look to be okay on 2914

358
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:43,900
maybe it's some problem beyond 1299 but

359
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:47,290
if it was then again 2914 would have had

360
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:49,060
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> change so you move on to the green</font>

361
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:52,300
path and see what happens from one to

362
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:55,510
three hundred 1 2 3 9's route 28 437

363
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:58,270
change in any way and when we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

364
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:02,020
1239 you see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one two three nine in</font>

365
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:06,910
this time interval had a longer route 28

366
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:11,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">437 and all of these prefixes now move</font>

367
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:14,170
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a direct link between 12 398 437 the</font>

368
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:17,110
the value in the brackets is the rank

369
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:19,750
change here and the value outside the

370
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:22,600
brackets is the link rank so you can see

371
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:25,090
the green bar sign 559<font color="#CCCCCC"> + 5 59 which</font>

372
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,730
indicates that before this event the

373
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:29,560
link rank of this this link was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 and</font>

374
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,320
it's just because of this event that

375
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,719
it's moved out so with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

376
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,450
diagnosis with possibly multi-week

377
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,700
multiple views from different points of

378
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:43,390
observations different<font color="#CCCCCC"> SS in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

379
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:52,180
you can understand these routing changes

380
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:55,569
much better<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so next we look at how</font>

381
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:58,030
link rank fits into some fits fits in

382
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,830
with some other existing tools another

383
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,510
tool that most people might know of some

384
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:03,790
might not that was being<font color="#CCCCCC"> developed</font>

385
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:06,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">parallely and independently from link</font>

386
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:10,209
rank is BG play BTW playe currently is

387
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:12,459
available from<font color="#CCCCCC"> rod views and the focus</font>

388
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:15,850
of BG play is to show routing dynamics

389
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:18,250
as observed at a single prefix and we

390
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:20,500
feel that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very complementary to</font>

391
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:23,020
what link rank does and can be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

392
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,760
very in a very good way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

393
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,369
the routing dynamics much better then

394
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:30,070
each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these would individually show so</font>

395
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:31,479
you could either start from link rank

396
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,139
and then when you see something

397
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,750
interesting

398
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,030
move on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to specific prefixes that you</font>

399
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,790
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze or you could start from</font>

400
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,379
BG play and move on to link<font color="#E5E5E5"> rank to find</font>

401
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,070
out what is the broader<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of what</font>

402
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:46,690
BG play shows you the best way to

403
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:49,389
explain what i mean is with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

404
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:53,740
and for this i<font color="#CCCCCC"> am using the third case</font>

405
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:57,400
study which interestingly is from

406
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:59,080
yesterday the reason i<font color="#E5E5E5"> put this case out</font>

407
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,280
is because it's still fresh and some of

408
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,550
you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have read it on the nano</font>

409
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,560
mailing list there was there were a few

410
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:09,879
male exchanges on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanak saying some</font>

411
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:13,810
problems with a major yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i speak it's</font>

412
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:16,600
been masked here but most of you would

413
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:21,700
probably know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is so this is the</font>

414
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:24,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">viewpoint 3130 remember note here that</font>

415
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,280
3130 is not connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one two three</font>

416
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">nine simply because there are no rank</font>

417
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,570
changes between<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3130 and one two three</font>

418
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:35,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">nine so all the rank changes are</font>

419
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:37,720
occurring from one<font color="#CCCCCC"> two three nine now</font>

420
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:40,030
you see that there is a red path out

421
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,270
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere and there is a green path</font>

422
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:45,399
which is compensating the rank losses so

423
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:48,000
this coincides with the time that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

424
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,910
event was supposed to have happened and

425
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,710
what we do is to understand this better

426
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:56,620
again when we see link<font color="#E5E5E5"> XY we see that</font>

427
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:58,330
the rank link rank has moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 11 which</font>

428
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">is almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> close to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 which means the</font>

429
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:03,790
link is almost completely done so what

430
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,940
we do is we look at some prefix from sy

431
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:12,700
to understand why<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix remains why is</font>

432
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:19,530
changing and for this we use BG play now

433
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:19,530
you can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so this graph is</font>

434
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,120
so I had to mask the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ace names and so I</font>

435
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,340
made it ugly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have driven them the</font>

436
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,659
corners where you cannot see but let me

437
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,260
explain with the help of this mouse

438
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:35,110
mouse pointer this was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> original path</font>

439
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,000
and now the paths are moving to this

440
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:39,370
alternate but the ACE names are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

441
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,680
visible out here but clearly it's not

442
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">just one observation point that is</font>

443
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing this prefix moving around but</font>

444
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:48,510
it's multiple observation points so for

445
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:51,040
this particular prefix I see that

446
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,560
multiple observation points are having

447
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:57,700
route changes and this makes it

448
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:01,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting so the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is I</font>

449
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:03,460
use the activity plot and I plot

450
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:06,460
activity from various pairs that i have

451
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:09,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i see that during this</font>

452
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:12,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">time this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the time of the event I see</font>

453
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,470
a vertical bar which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a high magnitude</font>

454
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,630
bar indicating something happened how

455
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:20,140
many peers did it happen it let's look

456
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:22,420
at so when we scroll down<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

457
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:27,180
activity bar it seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be consistent</font>

458
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:29,470
on almost all the peers we observe it

459
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,390
besides some other dynamics which are

460
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,570
also present which vary but this bar

461
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:37,150
seems to be consistently seen across a

462
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:39,010
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of peers a lot of views which is</font>

463
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,920
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean and when you see so many</font>

464
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:44,440
views seeing something consistent you

465
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,840
want to be able to combine all these

466
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,210
views into one global picture which you

467
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,370
can understand much better this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

468
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:53,170
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that link rank does quite well</font>

469
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,540
and we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> still working on some</font>

470
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,970
interface issues so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I cannot show you</font>

471
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,889
how the thing would actually look but we

472
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,470
will figure that out pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon I can</font>

473
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,550
show you a hand constructed graph which

474
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,340
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into account some</font>

475
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:09,550
visualization issues which looks like

476
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:13,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">this for simplicity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have included</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only</font>

477
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:15,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">five or you have five views in this case</font>

478
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:18,120
the dashed lines in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case indicate</font>

479
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:20,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">loss the solid lines indicate gain and</font>

480
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">the color of the lines corresponds to</font>

481
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:27,700
the color of the observation point so

482
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:32,890
for example the red line is 3561 and the

483
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:34,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">orange line is 31 30 which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

484
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,160
directly<font color="#CCCCCC"> connected to</font>

485
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,350
239 from weather changes take place so

486
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,780
such a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only tells you what</font>

487
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:43,699
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong in the network or what is going</font>

488
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:46,070
on but also sort of tells you where the

489
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,350
alternative traffic is moving you can

490
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:51,350
see that almost all of this has moved to

491
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:53,178
the peering between<font color="#E5E5E5"> Z and Y and this is</font>

492
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:56,949
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> indication of how the routes get</font>

493
00:21:53,179 --> 00:22:00,140
balanced when<font color="#E5E5E5"> events like this happen</font>

494
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:04,940
another tool that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty popular is a</font>

495
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:07,850
route<font color="#E5E5E5"> Explorer we once again feel that</font>

497
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:12,350
would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> remind the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> audience that</font>

499
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:17,658
of global monitoring and we had this

500
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,490
this a<font color="#CCCCCC"> more objective of being able to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">combine news from different days right</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">rank compliments are out explorer very</font>

504
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,270
well because a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> explorer combines</font>

505
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:31,850
many views from inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> na s and so we</font>

506
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:35,090
feel we can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> these tools together to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">get a much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better picture also link rank</font>

510
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:45,379
on operator expertise to make inference

511
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:47,750
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> those some ongoing work going</font>

on<font color="#CCCCCC"> in our group on graph theoretic</font>

513
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:52,190
called inference and we hope that some

514
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:57,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this might directly translate into</font>

515
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:59,780
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> link rank tool in summary link rank</font>

516
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:02,690
is used to make sense of huge chunks of

517
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp data and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have used this tool</font>

518
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,190

519
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,928
useful to get a good feel of what has

happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a particular day or in a</font>

job of combining<font color="#CCCCCC"> news from various</font>

524

<font color="#E5E5E5">very useful feature that link rank has</font>

can give you a good good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of what is</font>

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,900
the common behavior as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as what is a</font>

global snapshot of the routing as

529
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,400
observed from various points you have

530
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,799
thresholds and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> drill-down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feature</font>

532
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,940
drill<font color="#CCCCCC"> down feature does is it can zoom</font>

533
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,400
into a time interval which has high

534
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,080
dynamics to give you present you with

535
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,580
more details so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can keep zooming on</font>

into time<font color="#E5E5E5"> intervals</font>

537
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,600
you're satisfied so if your activity

538
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,908
graph spans let's say a month in this

539

much<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can zoom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a particular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> area</font>

540
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:56,269
which would then be one week then zoom

541
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,399
in it would be one day and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

542
00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:01,610
forth until you are happy with<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:15,019
miss a routing dynamic so easy so final

547
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:18,470
slide this is why we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> here at Point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font>

548
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:21,470
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are seeking input from the operators</font>

549
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:24,440
from the Nano community on how we can

550
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:27,169
improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> this tool and how we can tune it</font>

551
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:30,289
to be more beneficial to the general

552
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:33,409
audience we are planning<font color="#E5E5E5"> a beta released</font>

553
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:35,330
sometime in December there is a plan of

554
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:38,029
doing some preliminary testing before

555
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:40,399
that and I would be more than happy to

556
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:41,870
hear from people who are interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

557
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:44,658
being a part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our testing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would like</font>

558
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:46,309
to use our tool initially and if you are

559
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:48,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested please do get in touch with</font>

560
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:52,010
me if you are interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in other</font>

561
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:54,679
clarifications views get in touch with

562
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:57,408
me I'll be till the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day right</font>

563
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:59,210
outside I also have more cases if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

564
00:24:57,409 --> 00:25:00,500
want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the tool in more details</font>

565
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,789
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have not shown all the</font>

566
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:04,340
functionality because of the time

567
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:07,250
constraints you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can catch me or send me</font>

568
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:14,408
an email and that just about summarizes

569
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:14,409
the talk so yeah questions

570
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:25,070
Bob Haskins Renesys I was curious how

571
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,809
well your tool works with large numbers

572
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:33,139
of routing updates we're talking like<font color="#CCCCCC"> yo</font>

573
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:34,730
millions of updates so we have so when

574
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,190
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of large number of routing</font>

575
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:39,409
updates there are two<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways this could</font>

576
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:41,720
occur this could be either from a single

577
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:45,620
viewpoint or it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be from multiple</font>

578
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:48,230
viewpoints most of the times we've seen

579
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:50,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the larger the number of updates</font>

580
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,559
the easier it is to capture with link

581
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:54,320
rank because link rank is designed to

582
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:57,289
capture bulk dynamics so in that sense

583
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,730
I'll be happy if you have large events

584
00:25:57,289 --> 00:26:00,350
with large dynamics because link Rank 1

585
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,730
message but if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are very small</font>

586
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,320
events then there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance that you</font>

587
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,940
might miss<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick link right so yes</font>

588
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:11,889
answering a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question it works better</font>

589
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:15,740
larger the updates any other questions I

590
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:17,000
think one question sure so it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> liq</font>

591
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,260
wreck right now is based on number of

592
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,929
prefixes is that something you can

593
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,029
change not all prefixes of course are

594
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:26,690
created equal is it configurable to look

595
00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:28,370
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SN's amount of address space that's</font>

596
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:30,409
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good point I actually missed</font>

597
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:32,020
missed that point I was going to say

598
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:34,190
that before we are looking into

599
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,918
alternative metrics for link rank and

600
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:38,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">Craig just mentioned one of them address</font>

601
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:41,270
space is one thing we are sort of half

602
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,870
done on and we feel the idea here is

603
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:47,330
that you treat a / 24 the same as a / 8

604
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:49,789
you just give it one weight and some

605
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,408
people might find that's not fair so so

606
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:53,809
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at alternative metrics</font>

607
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:55,399
and that should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> available in the ulus</font>

608
00:26:53,809 --> 00:27:00,678
that we come out with in<font color="#CCCCCC"> December for</font>

609
00:26:55,399 --> 00:27:05,439
sure so yes we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think that's</font>

610
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:05,440
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>
