<font color="#E5E5E5">okay my name is Lori Blanc I'm project</font>

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,549
and this will just be a brief<font color="#CCCCCC"> update on</font>

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:18,930
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> PS LNG see curious how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">are familiar with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RPS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> L standard not</font>

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:25,590
a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to</font>

7
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:27,990
go into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> details</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our psl so our PS</font>

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,420
LNG is is an update<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the rbs.l</font>

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,329
standard to support ipv6 and multicast

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,430
and it's been a work in progress for

11
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,829
about the last three and a half four

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,210
years or so so it's taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of time</font>

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:45,539
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken longer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than we had hoped for</font>

14
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:47,250
so we had several goals while we wanted

15
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,590
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain backward compatibility with</font>

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,719
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl so we didn't have like a flag</font>

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,350
day type situation where people had to

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,629
switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to a new server it was also</font>

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,149
important to try to limit the number of

20
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:03,110
new attributes and classes in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl</font>

21
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,790
and to maintain readability and

22
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,110
understandability so people don't get

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,750
confused when trying to figure out

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:13,799
policy and trying to create policy in

25
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,119
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> psl so we pretty much finalized the</font>

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,680
standard at this point there is a

27
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,950
mailing list where you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,479
archives or you can submit comments but

29
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,320
at this point I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're pretty much</font>

30
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,810
done so a brief<font color="#E5E5E5"> summary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of changes there</font>

31
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,860
was one new class that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was created the</font>

32
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,630
route 6 class which is equivalent to the

33
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,920
route class accepted<font color="#CCCCCC"> it supports ipv6</font>

34
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,929
prefixes the other significant change is

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,290
with the autonomic class which is used

36
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,950
to express a s policy so there were

37
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,840
three new attributes created there a

38
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:52,829
multi-protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> import export and default</font>

39
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,390
and there was a an AFI keyword added to

40
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:59,969
support address-family specification and

41
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:03,780
several other new attributes were added

42
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:06,890
to dip to various set classes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,179
won't go into those in any real detail

44
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:13,110
so here's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of brief</font>

45
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:17,370
examples the first one is route 6

46
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">s that I mentioned so you see there ipv6</font>

47
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,870
prefix and the origin is pretty simple

48
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,390
example and and with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> autonome object</font>

49
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:30,540
again you have the AFI specification and

50
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:33,480
there's several different types shown

51
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">here this was taken from the right test</font>

52
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,190
database they have a test server which

53
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,180
implements<font color="#CCCCCC"> RPS LNG so there's some</font>

54
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:44,190
actual policy they are real policy as

55
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,610
far as the standard status the internet

56
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,170
draft was brought to before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the iief ITF</font>

57
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,930
operations and management working group

58
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:55,260
chairs we started not to reconstitute

59
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,600
the RPS working group since the standard

60
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,190
was it's pretty minor update to the

61
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,350
existing standard and we didn't really

62
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,359
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through all that work so the</font>

63
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,390
working group chairs agreed to Shepherd

64
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,970
it through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isg and it's actually</font>

65
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">been approved by the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isg and so at this</font>

66
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,950
point we're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> waiting on the RFC</font>

67
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:17,250
editor to provide their comments or

68
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:20,518
approval and so you can find an HTML

69
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:24,299
version of the draft on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ra DB</font>

70
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:27,450
website as far as implementations there

71
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:30,480
are two implementations in<font color="#CCCCCC"> who is server</font>

72
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:33,089
software both<font color="#CCCCCC"> merit and ripe ncc have</font>

73
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,450
implemented support marriage has their

74
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,390
version available on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ird net web</font>

75
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,399
site and we just released the 2.2

76
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,850
version today<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is consistent with</font>

77
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest draft our ripe NCC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has also</font>

78
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:51,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">updated the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ar-ar-ar-ar-ar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tool set with</font>

79
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:54,000
RPS LNG compliance and they are actually

80
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,429
turning this code over to ISC for

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,019
long-term maintenance at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

82
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,470
don't they don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be in</font>

83
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,890
provide maintenance and they felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISC</font>

84
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,470
was a better place to maintain it

85
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:09,238
however they will continue to to

86
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,910
incorporate patches and updates it will

87
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:17,060
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a is you will maintain the CVS</font>

88
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:19,409
repository so as of today Marik has

89
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:22,048
implemented our pathology in the

90
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:25,880
production are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DB registry and you can</font>

91
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:28,370
now register route<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 objects and I</font>

92
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">b6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and multicast policy and we actually</font>

93
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,210
actually had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple people today who</font>

94
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,340
were so so excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they went ahead</font>

95
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:39,289
and registered a couple route<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 objects</font>

96
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:42,530
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> RIT be ripe is planning deployment</font>

97
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,570
in November at some point they need to

98
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,700
roll out their software get it all

99
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:48,920
committed<font color="#E5E5E5"> into CBS to make a release</font>

100
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,909
they do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a test server that's up</font>

101
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:55,970
right now on our PS<font color="#E5E5E5"> LNG right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pat net</font>

103
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:02,270
registries like ap Nick or a number of

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,979
providers have their own registries<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

105
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:10,219
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not currently aware of any</font>

106
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:13,040

107
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:16,700
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit different topic but since the</font>

108
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,530
RPS<font color="#E5E5E5"> LNG work is pretty much finalized we</font>

109
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,270
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be good to try to do</font>

110
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,909
better coordination among the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRR</font>

111
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:26,990
operators so we've set<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a mailing list</font>

112
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:28,520
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Merritt that we're hosting and we'd</font>

113
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to address several issues such as</font>

114
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,409
actually getting deployment among the

00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,010
various registries with<font color="#CCCCCC"> rps lng support</font>

116
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:39,890
and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address other issues like</font>

117
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:42,440
authority issues in hierarchy marine and

118
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:44,630
replication issues and also looking at

119
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,370
new standards like the crisp work in

120
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:52,130
IETF as well as new working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in</font>

121
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,420
routing security bgp security so we'd

122
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,850
like to encourage people to join this

123
00:05:53,420 --> 00:06:03,190
mailing list if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have any opinions</font>

124
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:03,190
or comments and that's it any questions

125

thank you
