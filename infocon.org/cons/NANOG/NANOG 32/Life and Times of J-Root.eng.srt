1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
so I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> excited to be here I'm</font>

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,930
excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two reasons first of all I</font>

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,370
have nothing controversial really to

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:12,840
bring up today so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,428
and the second thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk</font>

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">about is I want to talk about the roots</font>

7
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,510
a little bit and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use Jays</font>

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,750
example and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the root</font>

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,330
servers they we all don't speak on the

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,740
behalf of any other other routes but I

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,198
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to let you know about</font>

12
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,948
some of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are going on</font>

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:36,420
with a couple of our instances as you

14
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:39,739
know verisign has two<font color="#E5E5E5"> roots one's a root</font>

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,329
servers net and that is a unicast

16
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:47,190
instance and the other one is j root

17
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:49,649
which is any<font color="#CCCCCC"> cast so what I like to do</font>

18
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,349
is I like to first call first of all go

19
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,570
through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> history of j root as many of</font>

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,840
you know it's gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> through a number of</font>

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,699
changes over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last couple of years</font>

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,940
notably has had IP address change and

23
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:06,479
it's also gone from unicast to any cast

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:10,380
and some other interesting things as we

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">found as a result of doing this so here</font>

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,530
you go you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> our historical query</font>

27
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:19,140
volume since februari of 2001 and the

28
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:22,140
stuff that's in the purple there to the

29
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:26,820
left is when it was a unicast address

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:30,329
and during that<font color="#CCCCCC"> time frame</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,520
november five 2002 it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of where</font>

32
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,350
that dip is right there's where the IP

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">address changed from the old to the new</font>

34
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,860
and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into that a</font>

35
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,170
little bit later and then the anycast

36
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,990
instance which started on March

37
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,360
seventeenth of 2003 and as you can see

38
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,369
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> those colors to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the right</font>

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:53,009
there are all different instances of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jay</font>

40
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:56,340
so here's a kind of a drill down on the

41
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,409
anycast instances and you can see as we

42
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,210
bring new boxes up what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

43
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,119
about this as they seem to eat their

44
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,520
young so if for example if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

45
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four right there's a new instance</font>

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,420
that was brought up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Korea and it's in</font>

47
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,170
red and you can see that total traffic

48
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,750
had not

49
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,220
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> change that much but it decreased</font>

50
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:22,770
the traffic to a number of the other

51
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:24,150
anycast instances and this graph<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinda</font>

52
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,880
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows us a little bit better</font>

53
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:30,870
where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that off to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

54
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,540
in September of 2004 that many of the

55
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:37,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">other any caste census actually dropped</font>

56
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,900
their total aggregate on traffic whereas

57
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:45,810
when the new instance came along it kind

58
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:48,569
of took over so now we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to flip</font>

59
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,209
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit and talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> j root and</font>

60
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:54,869
in when it's changed its IP address and

61
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:57,480
as you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the new IP address</font>

62
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,420
took off in increase in traffic which is

63
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">expected but was interesting here is the</font>

64
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,470
green line and the green line is old IP

65
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,600
address and what's interesting about

66
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,370
this is whenever you have a root server

67
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,400
you kind of have a disease<font color="#E5E5E5"> that light</font>

68
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,410
lasts<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lifetime and so forth as long as</font>

69
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,450
that that IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> is exposed on the</font>

70
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet it's going to get I DNS traffic</font>

71
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,380
and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about what types</font>

72
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,340
of DNS traffic it actually sees here in

73
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,870
a moment and here's a drill down a

74
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,440
little bit closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the actual</font>

75
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:31,079
change the IP address that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the address</font>

76
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">was actually announced on november five</font>

77
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:36,810
of 2002 and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could see that traffic</font>

78
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,970
in that afternoon that that afternoon

79
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,040
zone cut release you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

80
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,370
traffic actually increased to the point

81
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,010
where a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple days later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it actually</font>

82
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:50,989
overtook the old instance with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new</font>

83
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:54,480
traffic with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new IP address rather</font>

84
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:58,200
so so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> does the old je root still</font>

85
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,810
have traffic so what we did is we took a

86
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,560
week's worth of source IP addresses

87
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,959
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually fairly recent and from</font>

88
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,560
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 24-hour</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> period we actually took</font>

89
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,170
out addresses that were<font color="#CCCCCC"> i probably</font>

90
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,500
priming queries and so we took those

91
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:19,918
that had that queried<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> j root at</font>

92
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,440
least three times and when we subtracted

93
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,870
those out it took out about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 700,000 IPS</font>

94
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,760
per day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that left us an aggregator</font>

95
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,860
low over 200,000 you

96
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,130
IP addresses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what</font>

97
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:34,260
was going on so what we did is we took

98
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:38,280
this really cool fingerprinting software

99
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:40,770
that Roy errands wrote FP DNS and tried

100
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,849
to fingerprint all of those IP addresses

101
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:46,890
and as expected a large number of them

102
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,840
were unreachable because of firewalls

103
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:53,840
and other sorts of things actually

104
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:59,609
internally we call them<font color="#E5E5E5"> IW peas so I</font>

105
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,950
idiots with firewalls so but with the

106
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,510
ones that we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> find reachable we</font>

107
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,039
found<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

108
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,920
forty-one different signatures

109
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:12,030
associated with them and the results are

110
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,400
actually somewhat surprising as you can

111
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:18,570
see a large number of the actual traffic

112
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,870
instances are very recent versions of

113
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:25,080
mind and this kind of dispels when the

114
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,480
the rumors that priming I which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

115
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:32,330
broken in earlier versions basically

116
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:35,640
priming is getting that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NSF 44 dot</font>

117
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:39,030
it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be maybe there's more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to it</font>

118
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:42,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">than this than what we see right now so</font>

119
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:46,200
what's going on well we really don't

120
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:47,609
know and so we really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

121
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,860
this a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more closely and we</font>

122
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,570
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a new theory because this</font>

123
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,070
sort of traffic really theoretically

124
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,230
ought to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully someday</font>

125
00:05:53,070 --> 00:06:00,659
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go away but as you can see it does</font>

126
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:05,130
not so now let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about</font>

127
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:09,660
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> J's any cat structure it's each side</font>

128
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:16,050
is globally visible behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s62 as 26</font>

129
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:18,960
for 15 and it is all of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are global</font>

130
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,850
all instances are globally visible to

131
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,859
anyone else now other words have

132
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,230
different policies some of them have

133
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,420
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of low key local anycast instances</font>

134
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:31,520
some of them have actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cast</font>

135
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:35,550
within their their own network and so on

136
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:39,120
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a global view which is kind</font>

137
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,110
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting in the local topology so</font>

138
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,790
that we

139
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,040
have a good understanding of what we're

140
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:46,230
measuring here is that we have multiple

141
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,180
boxes behind but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are answering</font>

142
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,520
behind load balancers and we have

143
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,960
monitoring boxes that are out in front

144
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,990
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those little balance or so you get a</font>

145
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:58,919
total view of the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the</font>

146
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:01,530
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did is we decided to take</font>

147
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,870
two 24-hour snapshots during the week

148
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,340
mondays are always heavy days because

149
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,540
that's when everybody comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to work</font>

150
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,310
and starts using their their boxes again

151
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,590
but so we use it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided to use</font>

152
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">midweek traffic both the Tuesday and</font>

153
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,909
Thursday instance and try to figure out

154
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,250
what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of systems are looking at</font>

155
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,990
these boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what we did is we did a</font>

156
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,190
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun things one is we looked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

157
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:28,830
geo-mapping I map the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address to</font>

158
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,330
geographic location we also looked at

159
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,820
what types of systems are hitting those

160
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:35,190
boxes and what sorts of systems are

161
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,200
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking for invalid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> t 0 DS and</font>

162
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:41,940
other sorts of interesting behaviors

163
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:46,560
that get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into so what we did is we took</font>

164
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:48,810
some commercially available software and

165
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,390
actually mapped the IP addresses that

166
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,330
we've received in those two 24-hour

167
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:57,539
traces and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mapped it to the</font>

168
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:59,099
physical location and the colors<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

169
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,940
are not showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the maps following this</font>

170
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:05,490
on that the brighter the color<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more</font>

171
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:09,900
sorts of queries that received from that

172
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:12,030
particular IP address so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

173
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,400
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> server which is based in</font>

174
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dulles and what's interesting about this</font>

175
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,109
is it has a course a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us traffic</font>

176
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,140
but also as a lot of traffic in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Germany</font>

177
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:25,530
and what's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this box is</font>

178
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:28,740
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a box that's co-located in</font>

179
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:32,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">aol's facility and they have a large</font>

180
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:36,360
presence in in Germany and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

181
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:38,640
actually shows through here now here's

182
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,520
another box which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Los Angeles and</font>

183
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,159
this traffic actually changes quite a

184
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,040
bit in terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDS a lot on the west</font>

185
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,230
coast but it also sees a lot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Japan so</font>

186
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,480
it's very close to appearing point that

187
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,100
deals a lot with Japan so that seems to

188
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,579
make sense

189
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,310
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as Australia here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another box</font>

190
00:08:55,579 --> 00:09:00,709
that's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mountain View and again most</font>

191
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the trap well unlike the other ones</font>

192
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:07,420
they had some much more sort of

193
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:10,579
continental US sort of flavor to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

194
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:13,639
here's a box in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amsterdam and what's</font>

195
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:16,550
interesting about this is I am sir are

196
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:18,319
in Europe obviously is a very much

197
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:21,290
congregated there and as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

198
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:23,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">eastern outside the United States as</font>

199
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:27,800
well as other places<font color="#CCCCCC"> like South America</font>

200
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:31,959
actually shows up<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well and London as</font>

201
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,969
well very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Amsterdam and</font>

202
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:37,969
finally here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Atlanta and you can see</font>

203
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:40,069
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> again there's quite a sort of</font>

204
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,569
locality of reference<font color="#CCCCCC"> in dealing with</font>

205
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:43,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">these servers in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic</font>

206
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:46,729
it receives from from those particular

207
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,560
sites and I guess there's one more

208
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:53,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Singapore and what's interesting about</font>

209
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:55,609
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's focused a lot on Asia so so</font>

210
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,709
what does this all mean well one of the

211
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:01,130
things that people always kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

212
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:02,839
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye candy but it used to be that</font>

213
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,970
there was this mantra that was spoken

214
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,220
here and its location<font color="#E5E5E5"> did not equal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

215
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,569
apology and that was because everybody

216
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,579
connected the United States because

217
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:12,860
their internet interconnect<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost between</font>

218
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:15,219
the countries were so high and as we all

219
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,389
know this is changing quite a bit and

220
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:22,730
location is actually starting to become

221
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:24,439
more aligned with topology so another

222
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:27,290
interesting thing we did is part of this

223
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:29,810
project is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> collected the details on</font>

224
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,730
the IP packets and this gives you kind

225
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:34,040
of a rough correlation and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

226
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:35,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">really rough this is not you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

227
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,910
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a really</font>

228
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:41,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitive on on the correlation that OS</font>

229
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:43,759
that sent that particular packet and the

230
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:47,290
TTL is less than 30 was typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Xbox less than 60 for linux for bsd box</font>

233

234
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,959
we looked at this we said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay give</font>

235
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,139
these all these IP addresses let's map

236
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,559
these queries by

237
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:06,540
iOS group and it is fairly common is

238
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,059
fairly expected to see that sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

239
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:13,049
behavior you have here linux windows and

240
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:14,639
slurs have a large share but one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

241
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:18,419
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was kind of surprising about</font>

242
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:20,790
this is we always look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> creating all</font>

243
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:25,579
this a pollution at the roots in terms

244
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:29,248
of sending all these invalid queries and

245
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:31,108
many of us I was somewhat surprised and

246
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:35,249
that Linux had such a high<font color="#E5E5E5"> number here</font>

247
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:39,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that windows had a significantly</font>

248
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:44,069
smaller portion so I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to be</font>

249
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:45,749
somewhat surprising so now another thing

250
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:48,149
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did is we looked at sites that</font>

251
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:49,769
were seen at IP addresses that we're

252
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:54,449
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> at two or more anycast sites</font>

253
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:56,759
during those these tests and we found at

254
00:11:54,449 --> 00:12:00,508
almost three point seven percent of all

255
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:02,669
the traffic where it was seen at two or

256
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:05,129
more sites and this turned out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

257
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:06,540
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than I expected and at</font>

258
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:09,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">that point we decided to look at a</font>

259
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:12,059
couple examples so these graphs are a

260
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:14,489
little bit small but hopefully you can

261
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:17,699
kind of get the sense here what's going

262
00:12:14,489 --> 00:12:20,579
on the one to the left has kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

263
00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:22,919
normal oscillation where it goes to one

264
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:25,919
site named shifts to another<font color="#E5E5E5"> and back to</font>

265
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,989
the initial site and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so forth but</font>

266
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,029
the one to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is is somewhat</font>

267
00:12:27,989 --> 00:12:32,189
worrisome to me because I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

268
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:35,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">where the abnormal sort of cheddar you</font>

269
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:36,238
can see that two sites two or more sites

270
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:40,439
were actually getting traffic at

271
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:44,029
approximately the same time and this

272
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:46,738
<font color="#CCCCCC">this I I was somewhat surprised about</font>

273
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:49,350
most of our findings have so far been

274
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:52,259
found at somewhat far-flung<font color="#E5E5E5"> slight sites</font>

275
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:54,539
places are not close to what we consider

276
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:57,389
the core of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet today but they</font>

277
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:59,249
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are again a part of this whole sort</font>

278
00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:03,600
of community so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to service them</font>

279
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:05,899
as well so the take-home of this is that

280
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">we expected to see some sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of sawtooth</font>

281
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:11,910
distribution if you saw it<font color="#E5E5E5"> two or more I</font>

282
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,620
peas at two or more locations but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

283
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a noisy distribution some</font>

284
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:20,070
these cases and this of course does not

285
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:23,820
affect UDP but it does affect anything

286
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:28,020
with staple transport and maybe there

287
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:30,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">are some things that actually are are</font>

288
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,970
taken care of by not running a by

289
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,500
running sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of local anycast instances</font>

290
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,790
but we need to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as root</font>

291
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,089
server operators to see what's really

292
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:43,650
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on so I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that to be fairly</font>

293
00:13:39,089 --> 00:13:46,140
interesting obviously I have a older

294
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:50,279
version the talk here but but this this

295
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:54,990
is actually another sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of another sort</font>

296
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:57,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">of view on Jay coming online in Japan</font>

297
00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:00,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">where given the tubes or aggregate days</font>

298
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,580
we have you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when Jay came</font>

299
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:05,610
online it did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not affect the total</font>

300
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,930
overall traffic too much and it shows

301
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:11,460
that the roots have quite a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> head</font>

302
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:12,540
room so that it if they didn't have

303
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,730
Headroom what you would see is a

304
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,069
increase in traffic because that there

305
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,709
was some amount that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually sort</font>

306
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:24,660
of buffered or not serviced<font color="#CCCCCC"> by someone</font>

307
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:26,279
else so it conclusions well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I</font>

308
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,370
gave Susan a heart attack and getting

309
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,650
this ready because I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> so late and</font>

310
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,420
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in consequence there's been a</font>

311
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">little work done with others and we're</font>

312
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually reaching out for others to do</font>

313
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,089
that this has been fairly interesting to

314
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:42,150
some of the routing people I've dealt

315
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:43,980
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they've actually been working</font>

316
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:47,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">hard on trying to figure out what's</font>

317
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:50,910
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on within the core we need to look</font>

318
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:53,400
at the retired je root IP address try to

319
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,969
figure out why is this continue straight

320
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,949
steady stream of traffic occurring and

321
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:03,810
and try to figure out ways to alleviate

322
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:06,120
that and finally on any cast there are

323
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:09,689
multiple ways of doing with any cast and

324
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,180
other it are there better ways than

325
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:15,570
others on this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need</font>

326
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:17,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">to look at and given how the roots are</font>

327
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:21,209
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our mantras is as diversity is</font>

328
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:24,930
good but its diversity worth having some

329
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:26,560
suboptimal sort of configurations and

330
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,609
finally as

331
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,250
dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these suboptimal</font>

332
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:33,190
configurations if that in fact is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

333
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,420
case the influence on ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> and DNS</font>

334
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,070
second a whole bunch of other things

335
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:39,240
actually are going to be put into DNS

336
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:41,890
which affect the packet size that

337
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,660
actually sort escalate into stateful

338
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,699
transport how is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that going to affect</font>

339
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,199
these these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

340
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:51,190
dealing with this oscillation that we

341
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:54,760
saw a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit earlier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so with that I</font>

342
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:57,839
that concludes<font color="#CCCCCC"> my presentation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and are</font>

343
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,839
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> any questions</font>

344
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:12,819
oh um very little work done with others

345
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:14,018
so can<font color="#CCCCCC"> attest some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on Danis would</font>

346
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,310
you like to make your data available to

347
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:18,250
the research community so we could study

348
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:22,689
it we we will certainly work with you on

349
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:26,829
that oh I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been I actually been</font>

350
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:34,690
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some others so so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font>

351
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:37,989
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about that is he great</font>

352
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:40,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">your the questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well thank you</font>

353
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">very much</font>
