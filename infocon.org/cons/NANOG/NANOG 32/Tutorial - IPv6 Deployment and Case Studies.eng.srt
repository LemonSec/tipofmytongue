00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">have you work both in the cisco systems</font>

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,780
and basically for I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been with Cisco</font>

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,820
for almost nine years working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,630
high-speed customers and large

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:22,470
enterprise customers and for last two

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:27,240
years are so<font color="#E5E5E5"> working quite a bit with</font>

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:28,799
ipv6 deployments and designs<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeffrey and</font>

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,198
over here also you know we work in

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:36,230
pretty much the same team working with

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,230
ipv6 deployments and designs and

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:42,610
related by pv6

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,410
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that today's the</font>

14
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:50,129
presentation we just kind of share with

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:52,199
you bring some of the

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,120
what's going on out there what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,650
main deployments what are the different

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,580
ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing things what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are some of</font>

19
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:04,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look out for</font>

20
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:06,750
by the way how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you over here are</font>

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,440
currently testing or doing something

22
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,440
with ipv6

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,299
these are like

24
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,970
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done any anybody has done any</font>

25
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,950
tended to fall

26
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:24,640
or in the lab environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

27
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:28,020
says it is this something related your

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,020
any broadband ice here

29
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,560
sure sure

30
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,399
so

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,710
um

32
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,870
maybe you know for some of you some some

33
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:43,470
information will be redundant so just

34
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:46,260
kind of bear with us and<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some of you</font>

35
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,590
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things will be more</font>

36
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,590
um

37
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:54,880
most of you have his slider

38
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,880
he slides already available

39
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,520
so

40
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,890
you have like quite a bit of slides over

41
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,449
here and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90 minutes to cover</font>

42
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:08,060
them so

43
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,250
me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> shipping only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might gonna skip</font>

44
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,840
some slice<font color="#E5E5E5"> but because they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

45
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,560
your reference later on and after the

46
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,870
presentation if you still have any

47
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,010
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd be around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here so you can</font>

48
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:25,840
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions and</font>

49
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:26,549
so first thing you know click update

50
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,270
that what is

51
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,790
ipv6 address looks like rice is like 128

52
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,530
bits so the first three best tells me

53
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,870
that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a golden unicast</font>

54
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">rally with addressed by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2012</font>

55
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:45,000
followed by 45 days so the first fully

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,680
asbestos<font color="#CCCCCC"> the provider part followed by</font>

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">the subnet ID</font>

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,260
then the fixed interface ID which is 64

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,929
bits

60
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:57,060
some of the basic things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going</font>

61
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,799
to go into details because our main goal

62
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,049
is you know to get you<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

63
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:03,720
deployment section and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

64
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:07,400
the deployments we have basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

65
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:11,700
together three case studies one is for

66
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:14,819
native ipv6 deployment then one is 46 PE

67
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,879
and then one for deployment in the

68
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:20,390
broadband area<font color="#CCCCCC"> papi what people are</font>

69
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:24,209
doing in the broadway near area<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

70
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:26,279
one of the things like what we are

71
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:30,629
working on right now is the activity

72
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">more related to ipv6 is in northern</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

73
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:35,849
you know it's more in<font color="#CCCCCC"> asia-pacific</font>

74
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">region and ripe ncc like in some</font>

75
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:41,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">European countries first since in</font>

76
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:45,209
Switzerland<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netherlands and Germany</font>

77
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:47,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">France these are all broadband when the</font>

78
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,060
search providers who are providing using

79
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,000
ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide broadband</font>

80
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:56,840
for their<font color="#E5E5E5"> varmint customers also the</font>

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,560
biggest customers biggest faces which

82
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,849
ipv6 is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being the point is Japan and the</font>

83
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">customer who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is doing it in the</font>

84
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:07,160
commercial deployment it's also in

85
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,900
broadband and so we'll also talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

86
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,470
one of the case studies that how they

87
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,470
are doing it

88
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,798
so the address<font color="#E5E5E5"> allocation policy is</font>

89
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:20,238
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know they they have this</font>

90
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:22,280
hurricane ipv6 so dope

91
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the top with the classic scenes that we</font>

92
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,489
have all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these different registries</font>

93
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:30,610
which fire gives like fresh 20

94
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:34,389
they're the different registries<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

95
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:39,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">assigned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> / 32 to the ice piece I feel</font>

96
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:41,259
fine / 48 to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customers to the sites</font>

97
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:43,990
so if you remember in the previous

98
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:45,789
slides the flat foldability plastics

99
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:49,240
before we have this 16 bits over there

100
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:52,090
Frank so depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on like you the the</font>

101
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,240
ice P doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to give / 48 to their</font>

102
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,250
customers this is where basically they

103
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,740
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> making their revenues also</font>

104
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,110
depending on how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits they give to</font>

105
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:06,159
the customers right they could give a /

106
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:09,069
64 / 56 or / 50 depending on the number

107
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:11,680
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits because more bits a site a site</font>

108
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:14,470
would have they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have you no more</font>

109
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,500
room to play with the bits that do more

110
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,500
things

111
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,639
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how</font>

112
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:27,680
summarize so in this particular example

113
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:30,680
we have two thousand one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

114
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,339
global unicast Charlotte with a / 23

115
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:38,059
which is a registry registry assigns a /

116
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:41,839
32 to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP I've see signs of / 48 and</font>

117
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:44,689
then from / 48 to / 64 those 16 bits are

118
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,599
basically in if I'm a farmer site if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

119
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:49,550
get a / 48 I have these 16 bits<font color="#CCCCCC"> rank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 5</font>

120
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:53,110
to the power 16 I could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this many</font>

121
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,110
subnet occurrences

122
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,350
so in this one you know keeping the

123
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">party in mind</font>

124
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:06,200
we have the ipv6 internet / 16 then we

125
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:10,840
have the in this example two different

126
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:14,620
IP and of course these are from the same

127
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,619
registry so

128
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:21,679
you have /<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 tues over here in the ice</font>

129
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:24,460
cream<font color="#CCCCCC"> is finalized 48 so why advertising</font>

130
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,380
the routes you know these customers only

131
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:30,650
announcer default route to the upstream

132
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:33,219
i speak the ice visa<font color="#E5E5E5"> announce the / to</font>

133
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,219
reach into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

134
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:39,919
one thing you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't we haven't</font>

135
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:41,689
covered and this you'll notice that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

136
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,448
know some of you might think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

137
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:46,279
happens when the when the customers are

138
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:49,009
doing home right what happens with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

139
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:50,659
multi horny right so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing</font>

140
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:53,150
right now it's it's not anything

141
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:56,539
different what we do in ipv4 when we

142
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:59,539
leak the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific this is some a</font>

143
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:02,449
major like a known problem in the in the

144
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:04,520
working group and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their eight different</font>

145
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:06,469
drafts which are being worked on to

146
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,870
resolve this particular problem that

147
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:11,229
what will happen keeping this hierarchy

148
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,430
in mind when you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi home</font>

149
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:15,758
environment and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to differ</font>

150
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,229
nice piece how you're going to do it so

151
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,259
that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if you go to</font>

152
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:23,330
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 working group you will see like</font>

153
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:25,249
different drafts which are being worked

154
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,580
on right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing like</font>

155
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:30,229
solid solution that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just do this you</font>

156
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,560
know so there are several different

157
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:35,360
options and and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance like right</font>

158
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,029
now people what they're doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

159
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:43,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">just leave the more specific you know</font>

160
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:45,750
when they do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing this is a</font>

161
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,370
interesting slide like what i was saying

162
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,500
for that more activities in the

163
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,960
asia-pacific region<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the ripe NCC is</font>

164
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:57,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">Europe and all day shifts of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the country</font>

165
00:07:51,960 --> 00:08:00,690
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest is 50 Erin</font>

166
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,690
those knowledge

167
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,260
not that much activity but not picking

168
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,169
up quite a bit one of the reason was

169
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,230
that the department of defense announced

170
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:13,980
last year that they want to go to ipv6

171
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:18,310
by 2007 you know so that can accelerate

172
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:20,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the whole thing and I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

173
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">how many of you are aware of the</font>

174
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:26,380
applications but the things that I was

175
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,260
in Santa<font color="#CCCCCC"> Barbara when they was ipv6</font>

176
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,610
forum conference and that's where they

177
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,049
made the announcement so the

178
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,360
applications they were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is</font>

179
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:38,469
like pretty advanced and things what

180
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,120
they want to do you know so right now

181
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:43,750
you cannot go into all of those details

182
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,160
but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just look up you know on the</font>

183
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,600
internet you will find out some details

184
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,569
on that

185
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,440
as far as the routing is concerned

186
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:54,410
nothing has changed you know you're

187
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,470
still doing this the longest prefix

188
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:01,459
match nothing has changed<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

189
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:04,009
routing protocols which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> their price</font>

190
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:06,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">EV for you have support for ipv6 also</font>

191
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:08,899
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some minor changes which are</font>

192
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:10,459
done in the protocols that as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the</font>

193
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:12,680
protocol the way it behaves is pretty

194
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:17,599
much same and all the protocols except

195
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,729
ospf right ospf is some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other more than</font>

196
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,389
minor changes the way it behaves you

197
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:26,000
know because now you have more certain

198
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:27,920
number of more<font color="#CCCCCC"> LSAs introduced and</font>

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,930
summer some of them are renamed some of

200
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,790
them are merged you know so the

201
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:38,779
functionality is a little bit different

202
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:41,000
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> only just doing the nlr I or doing</font>

203
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:44,560
some longest prefixes support for

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,560
longest prefixes is more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

205
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:55,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so all the as far as you get most</font>

206
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:59,260
of you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that rep ng is the for ipv6</font>

207
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:01,990
based on based on rip version 2 and then

208
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:06,100
we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> igrp for ipv6 hosts</font>

209
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:08,830
differently and integrated is is that I

210
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,290
said you know for ospf you have quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

211
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:13,180
bit of changes which are the way the

212
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:16,900
protocol behaves it's a little bit

213
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:21,489
different now but when we first started

214
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:23,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to support ipv6 the first thing of</font>

215
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,050
course was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> riff and G because it was</font>

216
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:28,959
easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> implement but after that was I</font>

217
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">sayest history's most of the vendors</font>

218
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,000
started to support because the way is is

219
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:36,460
worse and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole TLD concept you</font>

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,050
know if you remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> initially when</font>

221
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:43,750
thy the ISS came<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tuesday 5tl v's right</font>

222
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:47,439
and then when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> added ipv4 we added</font>

223
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:49,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">five mokey Elvis but when we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> added ipv6</font>

224
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,240
we added two more clearly said was

225
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,460
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much ready to support ipv6 that</font>

226
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,670
was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons that when</font>

227
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:00,390
they started to support ipv6 for<font color="#CCCCCC"> link</font>

228
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:03,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">state protocols it was i sighs before</font>

229
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,850
ospf because ospf needed more work to be

230
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,850
done

231
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:13,540
you could have a basically concept of

232
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:16,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">shipping the knife for CF where you have</font>

233
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,069
ospf version 2 and 0 spea version 3 are

234
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,440
running at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that time you know you have</font>

235
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,290
basically two different SPFs running so

236
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,730
once you're doing that you have to keep

237
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,650
just saying this you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

238
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,110
do it it's just isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy thing to say</font>

239
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">but once you really deploy that you know</font>

240
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,680
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in mind</font>

241
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,569
for instance you know yet you'll have to

242
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,670
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure when you make these routers</font>

243
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,680
seduced a crowd or supporting out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

244
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,819
version 2 and version free you got to

245
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that you know you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

246
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,870
enough memory enough processing power

247
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:46,360
because now you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

248
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,250
this robber basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

249
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,380
different SPS right you'll have two

250
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:53,920
different routing tables so the package

251
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:57,720
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> come in for coming for v4 you go</font>

252
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,640
look into the oil ospf version 2

253
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,290
forwarding table and then for version 3

254
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,650
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be different right so it'll be</font>

255
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:07,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">double the capacity</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hour and everything</font>

256
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,430
so you have to once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you kind of we have</font>

257
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,770
customers right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are doing this</font>

258
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:14,020
but you have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you're</font>

259
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,959
needing the doctor all the guidelines

260
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,520
right so there's no easy we like to just

261
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,010
put like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten pounds of sugar</font>

262
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:24,339
and a five-pound bag so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to get</font>

263
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:29,380
to be follow all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guidelines the</font>

264
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:31,630
other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sighs as you know</font>

265
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,760
that it's being supported right now but

266
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,650
the other concept is I size multi

267
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,720
topology which is also being supported

268
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,670
right now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could have you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

269
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,260
different topologies two different SPS

270
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,209
because right now with is I is the

271
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,370
current weight the way it<font color="#CCCCCC"> works could</font>

272
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:47,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">only have a single topology for both</font>

273
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,720
leave v

274
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,310
and v6 but much<font color="#E5E5E5"> its polish you could</font>

275
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,140
have separate apologies which is also

276
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:59,560
supported right now then you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> V</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GPA</font>

277
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:02,080
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> VDP was easy right for v 60 day</font>

278
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,810
they using<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi protocol bgp now they</font>

279
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:08,290
have another<font color="#CCCCCC"> address-family</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fi to which</font>

280
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:10,510
is for ipv6 of course all the sub

281
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:13,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">adverse families are same in all the</font>

282
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,230
edges families

283
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:21,490
there was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very quick update</font>

284
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:27,630
what's going on around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world what's</font>

285
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:27,630
water<font color="#CCCCCC"> things some related to ipv6</font>

286
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:33,320
so SP deployments right activities

287
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,540
basically you have several market

288
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,210
segments<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet exchanges the</font>

289
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,520
transit carriers<font color="#E5E5E5"> we philosophy is the</font>

290
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,200
wireless mobile operators and each of

291
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,170
them you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be doing things</font>

292
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:48,430
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit differently than others but</font>

293
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,430
as far as

294
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,130
as far as the mean

295
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,280
if I fall

296
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,350
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

297
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,990
but mainly you know for ipv6 there's no

298
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,210
you know cookie cutter approach or there

299
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,550
is no you know deadline or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

300
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,410
you know this has to happen by this

301
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,030
dated all around the world because

302
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,800
you're running out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> something or</font>

303
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:19,839
there's some deadlines a y2k or

304
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,819
something nothing like that so it's all

305
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,790
going to depend on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the requirements</font>

306
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,620
coming from the customers Frank<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

307
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,319
what they want to do what they're asking

308
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,540
for if all this investment that whatever

309
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,330
we are doing making sense or not so

310
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,400
depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on different countries regions</font>

311
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,590
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in countries different</font>

312
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,840
cities all that sort of stuff like

313
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:43,420
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with one customer in</font>

314
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">malaysia in kuala lumpur you know</font>

315
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,349
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something you know with</font>

316
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,150
wireless and ipv6 they have these

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">waterfalls they want to do this thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

318
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,260
kale and for longer so it's all depends

319
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know where you are what are the</font>

320
00:14:53,260 --> 00:15:00,220
requirements purses in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Japan basically</font>

321
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:01,600
they're deploying ipv6 that's one of the

322
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,570
biggest departments and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and</font>

323
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:09,070
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing focusing on all the all</font>

324
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:10,780
the broadband customers right and so to

325
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,760
keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know like your</font>

326
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,250
kind of shifting from that this dial up

327
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,930
environment to a broadband environment

328
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,000
right where you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> always all the</font>

329
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">connectivity and there's no more you</font>

330
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,510
know you go there you dial up you get

331
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,940
the address and once you're done you

332
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:26,980
release it someone else use it now it's

333
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">like broadband environment things are</font>

334
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,360
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the time and the</font>

335
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:34,900
address is going to be needed all the

336
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:39,690
time right and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> another big</font>

337
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:45,760
application<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you know ipv6 which is</font>

338
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:47,350
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> evaluated and also a lot of things</font>

339
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,439
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in that part of the work is</font>

340
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,570
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mobile right so if you see what</font>

341
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:56,940
where we live right now in this part of

342
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:59,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world or you know even in the Europe</font>

343
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,120
you get pretty much you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

344
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,069
landlines and all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are no</font>

345
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,010
problem but if you see if you pick up

346
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:11,260
like the four or five big countries in

347
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:13,780
the world right Jimmy Indonesia India

348
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,250
China Pakistan Bangladesh these five

349
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">countries we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have more than half of the</font>

350
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:21,190
world's population and even to this day

351
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:24,250
and majority of the cases you know if

352
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:26,740
you go if<font color="#CCCCCC"> not get the landline very</font>

353
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,740
easily right takes time you know that

354
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,120
part of part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world there's</font>

355
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,779
you know their job that you know if i

356
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:36,930
apply for<font color="#E5E5E5"> four to get a landline maybe</font>

357
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:40,290
my kids will get it takes cut quite a

358
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:42,420
bit yeah and but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time you</font>

359
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,520
know even<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm originally from Pakistan</font>

360
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:49,829
you know and when I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> there to my</font>

361
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:51,510
village somewhere a person can they

362
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,790
won't have a landline anything but if

363
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know they go to town</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> center or</font>

364
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,349
somewhere they can still get mobile

365
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:00,300
phone rang and they can get connected

366
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,279
right they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make phone calls all over</font>

367
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,188
the world so the applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

368
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:07,380
thinking and in that part of the world

369
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:10,380
things are being tested that<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say</font>

370
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:13,020
on this mobile phone you have a IP step

371
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,490
right and if you have IP stack of this

372
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,650
mobile phone or

373
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,300
whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is right now you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

374
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:21,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">this guy connected on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet as</font>

375
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,760
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so this thing is basically</font>

376
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:28,470
connects to if you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the 3g</font>

377
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:31,830
right the 3g gets you<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 megabits rates</font>

378
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:35,210
right and 3gp p which is the body for

379
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:38,370
for all the standards they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have chosen</font>

380
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:41,670
ipv6 as the de<font color="#CCCCCC"> facto stack on all the</font>

381
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:44,959
devices which are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> built in</font>

382
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:49,260
future like which are billions right so

383
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically that if you have this PDA or</font>

384
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:54,090
mobile phone or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever it is you know</font>

385
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:58,190
with ipv6 tag the opportunities are

386
00:17:54,090 --> 00:18:00,389
pretty much a pretty big because that

387
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,040
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy can get connected on the</font>

388
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet at the same time if you have</font>

389
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,320
some local provider who's providing some

390
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,750
kind of stream of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the interest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

391
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,850
people right if it's like cricket

392
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,920
highlights or you know anything and need

393
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,840
movies or whatever the songs or whatever

394
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,240
the things people like you know they

395
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,879
could put a spot a local server at

396
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,480
people most of time they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could watch on</font>

397
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,250
this you know this PDA or whatever in

398
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,400
smaller lies they have they<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do</font>

399
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:31,710
quite a bit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also you know when we</font>

400
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,429
work in that part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world and you</font>

401
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:37,309
know things doesn't have to be big like

402
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:38,929
over here things

403
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:41,269
even have smaller things people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

404
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:44,749
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it so those are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

405
00:18:41,269 --> 00:18:47,299
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are evaluating right now</font>

406
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:49,779
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> far as the v6 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole market</font>

407
00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:49,779
is concerned

408
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,760
sure right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can do it but you'll</font>

409
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,760
have to do next

410
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:07,230
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> privacy</font>

411
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,230
your ledger system at

412
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll just maybe you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skip some</font>

413
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,060
slides in

414
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,559
as far as the

415
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,440
performance in areas are concerned for

416
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,080
the core of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network you know</font>

417
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:34,289
you could have

418
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,879
native right when I say native it's not

419
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:37,320
it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to have</font>

420
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,330
any ipv4 you're going to have a dual

421
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,668
stack environment right so you have all

422
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:44,850
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these devices which are groups like</font>

423
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:46,350
they're supporting IP v4 and v6 right so

424
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,330
you have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different folding tables</font>

425
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:50,820
remember the things I talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about all</font>

426
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,830
the limitations all the guidelines you

427
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:56,700
have to meet the crossing power to all

428
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:58,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the memory and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> em all gotta have</font>

429
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:02,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hardware forwarding and all those things</font>

430
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,769
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to keep in mind or you could</font>

431
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the core you could have maybe</font>

432
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:08,909
you're running and pls right so as we

433
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,730
know that you have two camps over here

434
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:15,630
so if you're doing mpls you could do

435
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:19,679
still 6p and you could you can deploy

436
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:21,269
ipv6 very in a pretty nice way which in

437
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,970
fact for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular case we have a</font>

438
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:28,830
case study and we'll go in details about

439
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:31,500
how you can do that as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the excess</font>

440
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,928
is concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> towards the customers you</font>

441
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,539
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> either do tunneling between your</font>

442
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:39,809
access points and the customers or you

443
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:41,610
could also do a native when I say native

444
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:43,289
again these two points a goose tag and

445
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,809
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some kind of you know rip</font>

446
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:49,139
ng or something routing protocol for v6

447
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:51,120
and exchanging routes so all of these

448
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:52,918
things are this basically right now

449
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">being done you know I'm different like</font>

450
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:58,480
some people are doing one thing

451
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,480
in something with the other thing

452
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,490
and one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep in mind you know</font>

453
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,650
that

454
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:13,020
decnet was not very popular than

455
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:16,020
it's compared to ipv4 but we still find

456
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:19,740
decnet right in the kisser networks so I

457
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:21,180
pc<font color="#CCCCCC"> war is like big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crisis it's pretty</font>

458
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">much deployed everywhere so it's going</font>

459
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:26,610
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take time you know to get towards</font>

460
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:28,560
ipv6 s and it's not again it's all going

461
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:31,409
to depend on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how what people are asking</font>

462
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:36,510
for and the applications comes along and

463
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:38,640
the farmers come along as far as the the

464
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:41,580
deployment is concerned you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know for</font>

465
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,230
enterprise and I skis you know things

466
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:48,120
what they have to look for is pretty

467
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:50,370
much saying you know as<font color="#E5E5E5"> far as it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

468
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:53,580
take you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the it could vary in</font>

469
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:55,439
little bit of cases but as far as the

470
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,139
major components are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much saying</font>

471
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,720
that they have to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

472
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,310
know they have to do all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> addressing</font>

473
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,490
part and then they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to choose the</font>

474
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:07,429
routing protocol right and then they

475
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,170
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure that the DNS</font>

476
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:13,170
environment is ready for that right so

477
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:16,770
bien esta you just look into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really</font>

478
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,540
quick but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the air</font>

479
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:21,300
records and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 we have the party</font>

480
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:24,120
records right so its dns is ready for

481
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:26,280
that to support that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also the</font>

482
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,840
transport is also available<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

483
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:32,460
before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 transfer is also there and</font>

484
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,110
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> management how these ipv6</font>

485
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,980
devices are going to be managed right

486
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:40,800
now to this day right now we do all the

487
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,840
management the transport is v4 right so

488
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,210
how are you going to do it are you going

489
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,730
these things to keep in mind what would

490
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:50,300
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security who</font>

491
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:52,670
the

492
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:56,990
one thing about you know choosing the

493
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:59,630
routing protocol that you have to kind

494
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:04,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">of keep things in mind and from the</font>

495
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:06,770
frost from the point of view that let's

496
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,600
say you have a OSP version<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running in</font>

497
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:13,760
the network right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now from point A to</font>

498
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:16,340
point B rank and and you you plan to

499
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,680
deploy oh sweet version 3 so you have to

500
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:21,350
kind of make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know you know</font>

501
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,870
all the details about the person

502
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:25,100
fermentation what I mean that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

503
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,110
you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that the person</font>

504
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,540
who deployed it like lesson<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the</font>

505
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:32,149
past you know they be played with the

506
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:35,149
matrix right so point from point A to

507
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:36,920
point B let's say you have a fat a the

508
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:38,660
preferred path but it's not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font>

509
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,030
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being taken because they played</font>

510
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:44,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the metrics right so now you deploy</font>

511
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:48,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">OSP a version 3 so now that will be</font>

512
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,909
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pre the most optimal path so</font>

513
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,770
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you run into some kind of</font>

514
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,080
issues right some problems and when you

515
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,820
troubleshooting that will be a pretty

516
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,290
big problem because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer the</font>

517
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">end-user you're going to say that you</font>

518
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:01,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">know with before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things are working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

519
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,620
but musics not working things are not

520
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,630
working okay because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know at the end</font>

521
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,429
of the day you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of make sure</font>

522
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:10,360
that you know all the details while

523
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:10,360
deploying this thing

524
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:20,490
as far as the transition<font color="#CCCCCC"> in integrations</font>

525
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:24,740
concern of ipv6

526
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:28,410
most of the things are you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

527
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,790
you have these customer networks lots of

528
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:32,460
them you know you have these islands of

529
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:34,470
ipv6 right now and these islands are

530
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,320
being connected by doing certain things

531
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:39,690
like I said in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous slide you</font>

532
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,820
could do tunneling you could do mpls 6pe

533
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,470
those sort of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> right there are</font>

534
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,950
certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things which you could do</font>

535
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:49,500
there's no expectation right now that

536
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">people would just rip off their ipv4</font>

537
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,990
networks and put in ipv6 in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

538
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:57,090
so you have to just kind of work and get

539
00:24:54,990 --> 00:25:02,429
the integration going you know in a

540
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:04,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">little even if you know you're not going</font>

541
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:07,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">into like big deployment or something</font>

542
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:09,629
you could still start you know have

543
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,489
these little islands of v6 and get them

544
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:13,950
connected and start playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it or</font>

545
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:16,309
something to get used to and get early

546
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,309
start

547
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,379
that's right

548
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:31,760
right

549
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:43,259
the PE routers<font color="#E5E5E5"> we deduced</font>

550
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:44,970
and for this particular exam 16<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

551
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:46,889
a whole case study so we'll go into more

552
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:49,170
details that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the whole process is</font>

553
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:51,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">eager</font>

554
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:54,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm trying to you know yeah that'll be a</font>

555
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:58,440
really interesting part for a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of new</font>

556
00:25:54,330 --> 00:26:00,419
folks over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as the for the</font>

557
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,120
integration the transition and for

558
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,800
existence is concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have you know</font>

559
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,199
you have dual stack you have tunneling

560
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,700
and you have translated<font color="#E5E5E5"> like dual stack</font>

561
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,770
I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what's the dual stack</font>

562
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that soon as you have you know by</font>

563
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:15,300
default<font color="#CCCCCC"> robber is a you notice is</font>

564
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:17,490
sporting ipv4 packets route and I

565
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:20,580
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that because for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco you</font>

566
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:22,320
know we were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP and Ethel talk and</font>

567
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:25,129
all the stuff there were like three four

568
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,600
stacks so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a mission but but</font>

569
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:30,660
why they use dual stack that usually

570
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,090
routers do I q equal so they they

571
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:38,310
basically once they start doing ipv6

572
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:39,840
they the dual stack right so or you

573
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,820
could do tunneling right and this point

574
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,740
of when you do tunneling only the tunnel

575
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,470
endpoints that will be doing stat right

576
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:49,230
then everything in between is going to

577
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:51,360
be whatever it is and then you'll have

578
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,280
some translation going in certain part

579
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,610
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network because what's going to</font>

580
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,610
happen

581
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:13,709
ok so in fact I have some slides on this

582
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:15,090
particular thing but as far as what

583
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,490
funding is you know

584
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:19,800
lesser your life in network

585
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:22,410
absolute saw prices with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two tunnel</font>

586
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,789
endpoints detect epson salt packets a

587
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:25,429
month

588
00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:29,460
right with the talent starts

589
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:31,710
encapsulated<font color="#E5E5E5"> mm to ipv4</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> password</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or the</font>

590
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,200
ipv4 network that lands on the other

591
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:36,950
parks other side that tunnel endpoint

592
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,919
that d<font color="#E5E5E5"> capsulate</font>

593
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:42,320
puts the intensity I mean that to talk

594
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,940
to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> confront</font>

595
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:50,428
courses

596
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:52,210
so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> do stack approaches little bit</font>

597
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:53,960
when more siren visit

598
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:56,570
you have

599
00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:00,400
crane protocol ID for ipv6 right so

600
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:02,919
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bureau x86</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DV</font>

601
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,320
so basically depending on this is the

602
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:09,850
preferred approach right so the panic

603
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:11,169
you can make your you know devices

604
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">dual-stack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and depending on the</font>

605
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:15,820
applications when they start to come

606
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:19,000
along they can choose whatever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

607
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:20,850
IP v4 or v6 they can do whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font>

608
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,190
to be done as long as it's there because

609
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:25,780
there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> API which is</font>

610
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,940
needs to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> written and they can so they</font>

611
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,899
can recognize this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing protocol IP</font>

612
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font>

613
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:40,119
this is some you know reference slice

614
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:43,090
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS but as far as you know the DNS</font>

615
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:45,610
part is concerned that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is one of</font>

616
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:49,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the good slide that a record what you do</font>

617
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:52,090
right you do from domain name to IP

618
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:59,008
address and from quad a records you do

619
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:59,009
basically from your name to ipv6 address

620
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:05,530
mapping and then you have the PTR

621
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:10,010
records the reverse of that right from

622
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:12,260
this is basically part you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind</font>

623
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:15,530
of make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your you're supporting</font>

624
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:19,580
that one thing to keep things in mind

625
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:22,370
that for when you're doing you're

626
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:26,600
deploying DNS right you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

627
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:28,399
sure that it's not only you have to make

628
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure that the dns server is ready to</font>

629
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,740
support like a and the quality records

630
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:35,750
right and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time the transport</font>

631
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,630
is also available the root servers you

632
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,580
know we're sitting is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like your ipv4</font>

633
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,050
environment and<font color="#CCCCCC"> goof server sitting at</font>

634
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,300
the v6 environment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to work</font>

635
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:46,190
right or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're in the week before</font>

636
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,720
environment and the roots are sitting at

637
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:49,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">the v6 environment it's not going to</font>

638
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,700
work so the Transport has to be

639
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,980
supported as well with the DNS like a

640
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:59,990
records and party records whatever the

641
00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:02,780
cases in this particular example you

642
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:06,590
know if it if I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to a calm</font>

643
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:08,300
right so I send a request you know how

644
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:11,959
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically works this up some</font>

645
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:14,010
basically reference lights I could also

646
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,350
do an extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> cry so</font>

647
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:20,640
if i<font color="#E5E5E5"> send that request</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

648
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:22,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">a wreck v4 and v6 addresses and based on</font>

649
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,880
the application and go get connected to

650
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,880
whatever wherever it likes to

651
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,570
this is that what I was talking about

652
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:33,658
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know let's say you have an ipv6</font>

653
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:36,210
environment and you send a request and

654
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:38,240
it goes to the dance to the roof<font color="#E5E5E5"> install</font>

655
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:43,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">over that's ipv4 it's not going to work</font>

656
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:46,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok and on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I wasn't</font>

657
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:50,789
aware of this animation sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

658
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:53,158
so in this particular case that if you

659
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:54,210
have ipv4 environment you send it in a

660
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,989
refresh to an open

661
00:30:54,210 --> 00:31:00,580
so where does this rule

662
00:30:55,989 --> 00:31:00,580
the this particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

663
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:07,599
calm and sausages

664
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:10,050
intercom

665
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:15,040
hey by the way the deli

666
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:17,230
this comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> back over here espn.com</font>

667
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:19,960
the delegation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this is sitting at</font>

668
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:22,420
this suture right and then when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

669
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,190
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here it's only supposed ipv6 right</font>

670
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not going to work for you so this</font>

671
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:30,100
passport has to be available also these

672
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,899
are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things to just kind of</font>

673
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,918
keep in mind when you deploying the DNS

674
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:37,049
for ipv6

675
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:40,470
the Duelist AG infrastructure we talked

676
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:42,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">about you know as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long as you're meeting</font>

677
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:44,999
then mark the requirements you have the

678
00:31:42,749 --> 00:31:46,889
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> family enough processing power</font>

679
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:49,080
all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things are being taken care</font>

680
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:51,269
of you should be pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine but</font>

681
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,039
there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way in search provide an</font>

682
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:55,169
environment that without meeting the

683
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:57,899
guidelines you'll basically jeopardize

684
00:31:55,169 --> 00:32:00,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're going to jeopardize your current</font>

685
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:03,029
ipv4<font color="#CCCCCC"> network which certainly we don't</font>

686
00:32:00,269 --> 00:32:05,519
want to do you know it's been i've been

687
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:07,859
with cisco for you know almost nine

688
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,080
years and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> started to start my work and</font>

689
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:13,350
the tech you know and I was there for

690
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">five years and with the pager all the</font>

691
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:17,820
time so but now things are pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

692
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:20,249
you know because it took time for people

693
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:22,109
to stabilize those networks so we

694
00:32:20,249 --> 00:32:24,299
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to tell people to</font>

695
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:27,720
take out before and put the OSP a

696
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:31,080
version 3 right but it's but it's going

697
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a integration in a way</font>

698
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,039
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know start from a little bit of</font>

699
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:39,230
sites and then you know you analyze and

700
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,230
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> expand from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there based on the needs</font>

701
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:48,309
this is you know some basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

702
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:53,710
some basic slides that how what do you

703
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,540
do on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> router to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it a dual spec</font>

704
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:57,070
these are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunneling they're</font>

705
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:01,110
different kind of funding mechanisms

706
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:04,810
which are available to terminal ipv6

707
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:07,649
packets into ipv4 over ipv4 environment

708
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:10,090
they're manually configured towns

709
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:11,470
semi-automatic and automatic you know

710
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:13,780
this almost sounds like you know

711
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,490
different kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of guns you know and I'm</font>

712
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:21,850
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the wrong place you know to talk</font>

713
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:24,460
about these things so in fact you know I

714
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:26,439
come from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pakistan and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we just grow up</font>

715
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,030
with these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it just happens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

716
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:33,760
be this<font color="#CCCCCC"> way you know manual semi</font>

717
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:36,070
automatic automatic so so man oh man

718
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:41,010
when you configure tells it took it took

719
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:41,010
you guys a while to understand ooh ok ok

720
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:47,908
so you have we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this manually</font>

721
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:50,549
right so you have basically two nail

722
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:52,649
tunnels right pretty easy source

723
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:55,019
destination source destination on both

724
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:57,359
sides and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn the traffic right</font>

725
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:59,639
then you have GRE tunnel which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

726
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,978
exactly the same nail tunnels but

727
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:04,289
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> these nail tunnels you know if</font>

728
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:07,080
you can expand the more sites you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

729
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:09,389
it's not not going to be scalable right

730
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,940
why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do one or the</font>

731
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:14,639
other manual or GRE they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

732
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:17,309
same nail tongues but only some of the

733
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,010
cases when you do GRE like in certain

734
00:34:17,309 --> 00:34:23,220
cases let's say you have these islands

735
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:25,349
of is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is right and you know the ice is</font>

736
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:27,779
also sends these layer two messages

737
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:29,819
right so GRE is only turning mechanism

738
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:32,159
which can also tell you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nursery</font>

739
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:34,139
information the Milky messages right so

740
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,849
if you have these islands of is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

741
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:37,409
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do manually configure</font>

742
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:39,629
towns it's not going to work for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

743
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:41,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> manual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> configure terms is</font>

744
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:43,409
not going to pass any of the lyric you

745
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:47,909
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so in that case you</font>

746
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:50,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll end up doing GRE instead then you</font>

747
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:54,679
have this concept of semi-automatic

748
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:57,479
tunnel vocal concept which is you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

749
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:59,490
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a slider I have slides on</font>

750
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:03,059
that i'll show you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the picture then</font>

751
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:05,270
you have automatic tunneling mechanisms

752
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:09,569
the two<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them which are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty popular</font>

753
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:11,130
624 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> iso tab 64 is automatic because</font>

754
00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:13,288
you know you'll see in the configuration

755
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:16,289
that you do not configure any

756
00:35:13,289 --> 00:35:18,450
destination the destination is found on

757
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:22,559
the fly you know so lonely configure<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

758
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:24,569
source address and the destination so

759
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:27,810
it's basically a point-to-multipoint out

760
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:30,450
just much more scalable and then

761
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:32,880
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> isotype isotype is again</font>

762
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:35,790
automatic funding mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> we saw is</font>

763
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,790
more used in a enterprise environment

764
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:41,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay let's say I'm i work for cisco</font>

765
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:44,400
right so Cisco I he provides ice except

766
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:46,379
you know handling I could do it my cisco

767
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,060
environment is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> i teased before let's</font>

768
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,430
say about your fiber and windows XP

769
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:53,040
machine and running ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to get</font>

770
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:55,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">connected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the ipv6 for so what I do I</font>

771
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">just basically make sure that I can</font>

772
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:00,690
figure my part lies the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tab tunnel point</font>

773
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:03,089
on my part and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> society has put up</font>

774
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,550
isotype router which is just what a goof

775
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:09,780
stack router<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can make a tunnel</font>

776
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:12,990
over ipv4 infrastructure from my point

777
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the isotope router and that i set a</font>

778
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:17,520
browser has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit it's basically</font>

779
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:19,950
a gateway you can get me connected to

780
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,670
anywhere on the ipv6 internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

781
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,669
that's the idea

782
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,859
so if you know somebody asks about the

783
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:31,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">tunneling so this is a good example and</font>

784
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:33,538
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can just keep it you know just kind</font>

785
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:37,099
of see because the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tunnel</font>

786
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:37,099
endpoints are dual stack in this case

787
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:42,640
just

788
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:46,279
all you're doing

789
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:48,288
encapsulating into ipv4 header it could

790
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:52,400
be done between the robbers or you know

791
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:55,309
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hosts since this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

792
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,940
operational you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who work</font>

793
00:36:55,309 --> 00:37:01,069
with the network I have just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick</font>

794
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,599
question that lets say 52 I have a

795
00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:05,150
simple tunnel you know point-to-point

796
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,589
tunnel and this tunnel is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming up</font>

797
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:10,670
you know I check the configuration

798
00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:14,770
everything is ok right and I'm handling

799
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:16,990
ipv6 over ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok network</font>

800
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:20,730
what would be what should be the case in

801
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,729
things let's say look

802
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:28,890
you know one of the you know in fact

803
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:31,140
there was one time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just troubleshoot</font>

804
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:34,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">this thing remember that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when the slide</font>

805
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:37,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">I said that tunneling is the IP protocol</font>

806
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:41,190
time when you turn the packets ipv6

807
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:43,109
packet into V 4 is 4 p-1 right so this

808
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could have a point to point on</font>

809
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:47,400
which is a warm towel there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a router</font>

810
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:50,850
in between somewhere which was what it

811
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,370
was doing it was blocking protocols I 41

812
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:55,650
right so everything was ok but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> town</font>

813
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:57,120
wasn't coming up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then took us a</font>

814
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:59,250
while to just get to that thing that

815
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:05,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that rather in the bed middle it was</font>

816
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">blocking that protocol 41 this is an</font>

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know manual channel</font>

818
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:11,180
configure configuration right here

819
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:15,330
pretty central power source destination

820
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:20,220
Fahrenheit ipv6 IP you know nothing else

821
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:22,170
nail tunnels on both sides GRE exactly

822
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,970
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

823
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,280
all you when would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that some of the</font>

824
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:28,290
cases when you want to use GRE and not

825
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:32,310
that manually configure<font color="#CCCCCC"> tells they're</font>

826
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:33,980
both the same if the network is big or

827
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:37,920
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> or you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do tunneling</font>

828
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:40,170
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very scalable this is the</font>

829
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,280
tunnel vocal concept that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are some</font>

830
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:44,940
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> services which are available</font>

831
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,890
right now on the internet so a person

832
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,320
you know let's say if I if I'm you're

833
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:51,450
not connected from isp which is on ipv4

834
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a windows XP machine at home</font>

00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:55,740
and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get connected on like</font>

836
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,750
these go get connected to the ipv6

837
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:59,520
internet I can basically go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font>

838
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,260
website you know some whoever's

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,660
providing the standard local services

840
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:06,450
and I can fill<font color="#E5E5E5"> out all this information</font>

841
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:08,910
and that time<font color="#CCCCCC"> the broker server</font>

842
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:11,040
basically pull push all that information

to a blue stack router and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time of</font>

XP machine or something dual stack

855
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,370
machine you can get connected on ipv6

internet this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the automatic tunneling</font>

00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:50,680
the 64 64 telling for this particular

858
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:52,750
type of tunneling you have a reserved

859
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,930
address space which just starts with two

860
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:59,310
2002 so the first 16 bits are always

going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 2002 by the way this</font>

particular tunneling type is you know

863
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:09,730
it's for people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are who never got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

global unicast audible address right

866
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:19,420
they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just use 2002 and then put</font>

868
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:24,430
bits and they can they can make that

869
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">dress look like a global unicast article</font>

870
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:29,558
address because it starts with<font color="#E5E5E5"> two right</font>

871
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:32,200
but only<font color="#E5E5E5"> use for the environment you</font>

872
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:34,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">know for the large environment put the</font>

873
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,520
enterprise environment as well where

874
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:38,859
people want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get their sites connected</font>

875
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,670
on ipv4 and they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> a case where what</font>

876
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:44,470
you know the test they want to test the

877
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:46,359
whole environment and you know get used

878
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:49,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">to it but obviously you know they wanna</font>

879
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:52,328
the the main thing is the everybody

880
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:57,130
should try to go to 2001 address range

881
00:40:52,329 --> 00:41:00,150
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2002 which is only fixed 464</font>

882
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,150
tunneling you can

883
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:11,290
ok so this too much information here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

884
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,710
a lot of it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip</font>

885
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:17,170
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 64 paneling type in the</font>

886
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:19,150
configuration 64 relay services is

887
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:21,910
basically just really quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you</font>

888
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:24,400
that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're doing that they</font>

889
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:26,529
can the truth the 624 connects the two

890
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,180
thousand two sides together but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

891
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:31,270
a two thousand two sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go to a</font>

somewhere else for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

894
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:37,930
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 624 relay services at six to four</font>

895
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,359
real a router again is a dual stack

896
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:46,120
router which is a gateway between a 2002

897
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:49,600
and the rest of the world okay then you

898
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:52,450
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt PT which is again what it's</font>

899
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:55,299
doing and brief what you're doing that

900
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:57,160
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot ten-dollar addresses to</font>

901
00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:02,710
the global addresses same thing is

902
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:07,270
happening between v6 and v4 I'm going to

903
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:08,710
again animation sorry well there and I'm

904
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,270
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to skip some of this because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

905
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:16,470
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get you you know to some</font>

906
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:16,470
deployment parts in the

907
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:34,779
ok so lets you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what we</font>

908
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:40,200
chip will cover the deployment part to

909
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:44,130
what the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> was that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both do 45</font>

910
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,890
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I'll cover that part in 45</font>

911
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,300
minutes so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was impossible so since</font>

912
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:51,120
this is like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font>

913
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:53,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">section right last session so I would</font>

914
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,350
really encourage that if even if going

915
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:57,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">over 90 minutes just kind of stick</font>

916
00:42:55,350 --> 00:43:02,060
around because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> part is going to</font>

917
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:02,060
interest you even more<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

918
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,530
a lot

919
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:18,370
he said about it

920
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:21,160
just a few points I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start with</font>

921
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:22,450
making some notes while Stalin was just

922
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,310
pretending

923
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:28,290
the rule of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information is actually</font>

924
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:28,290
available in the slides I definite ID

925
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:35,090
so first of all as an argument<font color="#CCCCCC"> why tv6</font>

926
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:35,090
and

927
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:40,849
addresses building

928
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:43,040
at the larger Addison space building

929
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:47,390
driver

930
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,800
however what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we noticed is that in the</font>

931
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:50,069
process of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up with</font>

932
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">business cases</font>

933
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:55,050
to justify the expense of

934
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:57,839
which in some parts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world is</font>

935
00:43:55,050 --> 00:44:01,049
encouraged by legislation<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

936
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:05,369
backstage so on so forth people try to

937
00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:07,829
find new ways to deploy services so you

938
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:08,839
feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be for network nice you</font>

939
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:11,420
tried to squeeze

940
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:12,869
the last drop out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it 30</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> foot on top</font>

941
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it all</font>

942
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:19,830
that are possibly BP

943
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:22,589
gasps all kind of SLA that's a lace of

944
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:25,078
supporting services so

945
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:27,180
but sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way you started that</font>

946
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,940
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and a big investment might</font>

947
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,609
not be the best way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you could have</font>

948
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:35,410
done it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you learn that</font>

949
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:37,770
ipv6 sometimes can offer you

950
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:40,259
of second opportunity the second chance

951
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:41,999
to squeeze some more out of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

952
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:46,139
and this time<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

953
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:47,660
so besides looking at the large letters

954
00:44:46,139 --> 00:44:51,130
in space

955
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:51,129
you might see I be single

956
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:58,430
the other observation that i wanted to

957
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,110
make obviously we're just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

958
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:03,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the point</font>

959
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:05,960
you have to balance investment versus

960
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:07,500
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> often times is going to be driven by</font>

961
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,380
your customer

962
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:12,819
whole idea is if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two customers</font>

963
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:15,460
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put too much money</font>

964
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:18,359
up front then it might be worth<font color="#E5E5E5"> what if</font>

965
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:21,250
you fight you do as little as possible

966
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:26,200
conservatives because however if you

967
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:28,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">look on the long run with the current</font>

968
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:32,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">state of ipv6 and with the current</font>

969
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:34,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">support of ipv6 by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mexican</font>

970
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:37,029
it might be worth

971
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:42,000
picking a second thought and

972
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:44,070
going for<font color="#E5E5E5"> full scale long term before</font>

973
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm saying this because the question</font>

974
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:48,590
of tunneling came

975
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:51,020
and everybody internally

976
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:53,870
and everybody 96 world was interested in

977
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:56,060
tunneling<font color="#E5E5E5"> and developed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Connelly</font>

978
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:57,670
in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people for encourage</font>

979
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,820
people to

980
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:02,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">esri investment as possible</font>

981
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:07,540
so we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting to a point where it</font>

982
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:10,109
might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> worth it to consider go</font>

983
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:10,110
the world's back

984
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:16,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so that will be my first speech</font>

985
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:18,360
production

986
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:21,220
oh you discussed

987
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:23,330
case scenarios one would be

988
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:26,279
more stack

989
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:28,590
dual<font color="#E5E5E5"> stack refers to the fact that we</font>

990
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,560
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to look at both ipv4 and ipv6</font>

991
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:33,330
in coexistence obviously when you're

992
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:36,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to eat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're going to be 4i</font>

993
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:38,569
can be six besides all the discussion

994
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:40,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">about money and</font>

995
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:42,680
the cost and how much going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get back</font>

996
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,240
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure like someone was</font>

997
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:50,410
mentioning you have to make sure that

998
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:50,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">during impact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on itv4 is not significant</font>

999
00:46:51,170 --> 00:47:00,390
so that's why along the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will talk</font>

1000
00:46:55,099 --> 00:47:03,269
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 mg</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 60 power now</font>

1001
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:05,908
it's very tempting

1002
00:47:03,269 --> 00:47:07,229
c4 to take your approach on developing

1003
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:09,420
guide on<font color="#E5E5E5"> at one</font>

1004
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:11,620
six in the same way you before it I can

1005
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,060
be for make sense

1006
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:17,130
the same philosophy my good

1007
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:17,130
with whoever you think

1008
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:23,579
most times that works but sometimes

1009
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:26,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">things</font>

1010
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:29,580
so talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual stack that means</font>

along side by side without people so on

1014
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:41,000

better be sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the consequent better</font>

both of them both these campuses are

you out for either exchange

1030
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:33,270
so this company applies for prefixes so

1031
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:36,150
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get their own pee fixes</font>

by the service provider as someone

1034
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:42,600
pointed out we're talking only about one

along the router

1040

1042
00:49:01,809 --> 00:49:06,089
now someone was talking about the two

00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,000

<font color="#CCCCCC">hottest-ever start now as you can see we</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> architect</font>

1068
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:33,399
configuration wise rather simple we are

1069
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:35,020
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at first and most important step</font>

1070
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,960
is enabling the writing process on the

1071
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:39,880
routers ipv6 unique and routing

1072
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:42,010
obviously found that terminology is

1073
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:45,070
obvious that we are talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about unit</font>

1074
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:47,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">class process is not a booty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gasps and</font>

1075
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:51,040
then found<font color="#E5E5E5"> interfaces we enable ipv6</font>

1076
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:52,990
these interfaces most likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> have ipv4</font>

1077
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:56,850
on them as well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> here we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1078
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:56,850
showing the ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> addresses</font>

1079
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:02,230
there are several ways in which you can

1080
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:04,080
you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but this is one way in</font>

1081
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:07,270
which we did we show clearly how the

1082
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:12,029
interface ID is defined in this case for

1083
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:18,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">example for Fast Ethernet 0 / 2 on</font>

1084
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:23,320
router r1 the prefix is pfft be 00 FFF

1085
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:24,700
to interface ID is one statically

1086
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:28,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">configured we could have led the router</font>

1087
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:30,140
choose its own interface ID with you

1088
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:31,820
if I'm using some terminology if it is

1089
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:33,259
not familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> because maybe you didn't</font>

1090
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,470
work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much like in your sixties let</font>

1091
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,470
me know

1092
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:42,550
once we set up all the ipv6 address

1093
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,900
saying you can ping between the routers

1094
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:49,030
you want obvious if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you turn on the</font>

1095
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:50,980
routing the choice cause is is you're

a song mentioned

1112
00:52:54,080 --> 00:53:00,110
we want to have at one point or another

1113
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:02,430
in our net we want to have sort of an

1118
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,109
this is that we even<font color="#E5E5E5"> used before in</font>

1119

order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer this traffic but there</font>

1121
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:26,400
net PT is going to be your wing

the same length but the link local

1154
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:07,930
addresses typically do not change so

1155
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:10,780
this way using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the link local as your</font>

1158
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:18,009

00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:30,510
there are is specifically told to not

1164
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,640
for traffic to be local

1165
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:34,710
okay so that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have that drop map</font>

1166
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:37,170
down at the bottom that says whenever

you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to advertise your prefixes</font>

1168

1171
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:50,190

everything everything stays the same

don't think I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

will tell the router to not consume that

1194

then to complete this example we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:12,420
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the traffic that gets to</font>

1199
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:23,140
particular segment we chose to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just set</font>

so far

00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:39,520
and just clear something to be run in

the election

along with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

1274
01:01:00,349 --> 01:01:05,960
saying when are we going to send packets

for that guy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2,000 10 41 please also</font>

1276
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:12,190
attach this ipv6 tag to the package so I

1277
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:12,190
so I know how to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it okay</font>

1278
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:17,920
now when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

1279
01:01:16,030 --> 01:01:20,810
one

1280
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:24,470
61 will have the following information I

1281
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:28,580
know how to get to two-thousand 10 4 21

1282
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:35,529
my next hop is going to be the address

Colin problem ffff column 192 dr. 5417

1284
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:42,200
that is the ipv6 map ipv4 address by

1285
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:44,330
build an ipv6 address out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my out of</font>

1287
01:01:44,330 --> 01:01:49,009
hop I also know that if I'm going to

1288
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:52,770
send this out I have to attach an ipv6

1289
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:56,690
label it will advertise typing

1290
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:56,690
and I also know that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

1291
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:03,649
made with my health might

1292
01:02:04,539 --> 01:02:07,739
I learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

1293
01:02:10,090 --> 01:02:17,100
and I know the tag that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was explained by</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">a el de or I RSVP so</font>

1295
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:25,640
ok so now here is in you know with some

1296
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,640
animation to say

1297
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:33,140
two thousand one is advertised two

1298
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:33,140
thousand on 0 for 2 10 size matter I PPP

1299
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:37,250
advertising<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all</font>

1300
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:44,900
in the ipv4 world

1301
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:49,060
but then byah

1302
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:49,060
the advertising<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2001 yo</font>

1303
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:55,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">along with</font>

1304
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:57,649
the neck top well is not just before the

1305
01:02:55,050 --> 01:03:00,490
ipv6 math packet before

1306
01:02:57,650 --> 01:03:00,490
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a label</font>

1307
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:09,880
never deliver these v6 by GPS to his

1308
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:13,118
client so now let's see how the packet

1309
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:16,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">traveled with that</font>

1310
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:18,880
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> laps routers into 10 96 packet</font>

01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:24,260
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> loads why I by his own igp that he</font>

1313
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:29,740

1315
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:36,040
6 p-1 picks up the packet loops

1316
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:38,259
up in his own writing table and sees

1317
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:42,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">that each if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to reach 2,000</font>

1318
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:47,970
1421 the next hop is going to be at Town

1319
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:51,180
Hall of FFF 190 2054 that end up 17

1320
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:51,180
which is

1321
01:03:54,619 --> 01:03:59,539
this means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'll have to encapsulate</font>

1322
01:03:56,450 --> 01:04:02,589
this packet we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> tag with ipv6 tag and</font>

1323
01:03:59,539 --> 01:04:05,710
then with an ipv4 that to do 6p

1324
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:09,099
so he's going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and add beside the</font>

1326
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:12,470
the yellow one

1327
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:17,290
we're also going to add the<font color="#CCCCCC"> LDP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> late</font>

01:04:19,579 --> 01:04:24,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">hold the packet along now the core of</font>

1331

1332
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:36,880
hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is the top little late</font>

1333
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:36,880
the LGBT so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one</font>

1334
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:47,680
he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the swap a typical mpls</font>

1336
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:56,440
swapping labels the router gets all the

1337
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:58,609
way to the penultimate are so adept

1338
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:01,940
another half

1339
01:04:58,609 --> 01:05:04,759
I pop the label now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the reason</font>

1340
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:07,009
why we need a night to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> six pack in</font>

1341
01:05:04,759 --> 01:05:11,119
order to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that this mechanism</font>

1342
01:05:07,009 --> 01:05:12,470
works with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an open on top if my internet</font>

1343
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:16,060
network

1344
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:16,060
the top of an ultimate

1345
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,570
I

1346
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:23,630
inside

1347
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:23,630
Oh

1348
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:28,580
yet this I think is

1349
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:35,029
so

1350
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:40,029
system that ipv6 label now

1351
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,380
that he can he still can process it he

1352
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:58,720
looks at the label instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking in</font>

1353
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:03,220
the 936 packet now he against that I

1354
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:06,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">that label packet doesn't look up on the</font>

1355
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:11,160
label sees what that means that pointing

1356
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:11,160
to his v6

1357
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:17,370
first that particular label

1358
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:20,819
the yellow<font color="#CCCCCC"> table</font>

1359
01:06:17,370 --> 01:06:23,150
and then thousand ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1360
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:27,270
Paquette wherever it has to be forwarded

1361
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:30,770
just a point of interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> here what we</font>

1362
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:30,770
noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> was well</font>

1363
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:39,259
you look up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this label right on the</font>

1364
01:06:37,229 --> 01:06:39,259
yellow

1365
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:46,330
these are rather small entities compare

1366
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:49,110
with the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> address so you two can</font>

1367
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:49,110
actually

1368
01:06:54,930 --> 01:07:00,779
so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> faster look up by looking up a</font>

1369
01:06:57,150 --> 01:07:03,270
very small label and binding it to your

1370
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:05,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">alban's urban interface then actually do</font>

1371
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:05,690
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look up</font>

1372
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:11,519
so our for example our original

1373
01:07:09,269 --> 01:07:14,640
implementation use aggregate<font color="#CCCCCC"> labels 2</font>

1374
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:17,270
u16 labels and we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> assign them round</font>

1375
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:19,720
robin<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1376
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:21,840
your family<font color="#E5E5E5"> League label too discreet</font>

1377
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:25,609
look up as much fat

1378
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:25,610
saves you a lot of fine lot of resources

1379
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:31,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6p is that is a matter between</font>

1380
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:31,309
three and six

1381
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:57,490
first of all I'm not sure why we would

1382
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:57,490
not

1383
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:01,069
why we go

1384
01:08:06,619 --> 01:08:11,980
if you have a tu tunnel or just pls

1385
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:12,279
the idea would be I didn't want

1386
01:09:48,339 --> 01:09:52,809
Jason now obviously

1387
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:55,180
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are talking about here is 60</font>

1388
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:58,920
there are other<font color="#CCCCCC"> mechanisms that</font>

1389
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:58,920
boy you

1390
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:02,990
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1391
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:07,290
you can feel

1392
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:10,700
and the other tunnel

1393
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:10,700
and then you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up your own</font>

1394
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:17,219
but then that's different you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

1395
01:10:13,810 --> 01:10:17,219
the dynamic aspect

1396
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,280
some information on standardization<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

1397
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:34,750
going to skip over this some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1398
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:37,050
benefits of 6p

1399
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:37,050
is

1400
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:42,770
actually it's be good

1401
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:45,440
works very well<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scale</font>

1402
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:49,030
it's a very

1403
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:49,030
you're familiar with VPN

1404
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,159
what you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

1405
01:10:55,270 --> 01:11:00,280
is sort of a glow it curve provides the

1406
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:01,719
global

1407
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:03,900
what will connect you to be for

1408
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:07,520
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your map</font>

1409
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:09,199
it doesn't differentiate between and<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

1410
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,530
so

1411
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:15,150
p offers you a one

1412
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:18,280
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses cloud on top of your network</font>

1413
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:22,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody sees every time</font>

1414
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:25,509
so it's a few eq would 60 you can make

1415
01:11:22,659 --> 01:11:29,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">an analogy with it</font>

1416
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:29,460
if as if you have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> big thing here</font>

1417
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:35,629
you

1418
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:45,200
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show them the</font>

1419
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:47,660
configuration wise and just drawing an

1420
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:49,550
analogy and just drawing a parallel if

1421
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:52,170
you're familiar with VPNs that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1422
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:56,980
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at deep at six</font>

1423
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:59,230
one big<font color="#E5E5E5"> DRS but that handle Tony</font>

1424
01:11:56,980 --> 01:12:00,370
so let's go over<font color="#CCCCCC"> this configuration and</font>

1425
01:11:59,230 --> 01:12:03,129
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will make things a little bit</font>

1426
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:07,450
more clear mini how the configuration is

1427
01:12:03,130 --> 01:12:09,250
done but<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom line is the idea is that</font>

1428
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:12,580
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty simple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty</font>

1429
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:14,890
straightforward to implement doesn't

1430
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:18,070
affect your core which is a big factor

1431
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:20,080
it's very dynamic it scales folding

1432
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:24,730
performance is excellent they're holding

1433
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:27,190
is done hardware to out so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1434
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:30,639
going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> little impact on your on</font>

1435
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:31,960
your performance of the network the only

1436
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,700
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to look is some of</font>

1437
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:39,820
the hardware resources but other than

1438
01:12:33,700 --> 01:12:42,070
that is it ok of the cons you don't want

1439
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:45,849
to do 6p if you don't run mpls don't

1440
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:48,110
turn on mpls just put 60 you need to

1441
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:51,320
understand mpls<font color="#CCCCCC"> MV GP</font>

1442
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:55,460

01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:28,129
and then maybe add a few dollars if you

as your customers grow and grow and grow

01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:50,390
you are

1590
01:21:52,170 --> 01:21:57,140
maybe one your data set

1593
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:04,219
you start to move your<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices you</font>

1594
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:07,269
increase the size of your ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> island</font>

1595
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:07,269
the device closer

1596
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:10,460
and it burns its key

1597
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:17,969
Sam scalability

1598
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:20,070
there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small slide here on interests</font>

1599
01:22:17,969 --> 01:22:21,449
which is you use three labels here i'm

1600
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:24,000
not going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm really</font>

01:22:21,449 --> 01:22:25,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of time but i can definitely talk</font>

1602
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,179
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you won't get their ass or</font>

1604
01:22:30,179 --> 01:22:36,150
note on load balancing it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for</font>

1605
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:39,389
reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for reference purposes you</font>

1606
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:42,839
look at the load balancing a few areas

1607
01:22:39,389 --> 01:22:45,239
but the 6p router is done based on

1608
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:48,270
hashing source destination and on a few

1609
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:51,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">outer now is supported on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so just making</font>

1610
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:51,739
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> control works</font>

1611
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:57,550
these are even better now ipv6 multicast

1612
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:59,170
like I said there is no way to do it

1613
01:22:57,550 --> 01:23:01,960
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6</font>

1614
01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:04,810
and if the old right is the old problem

1615
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:08,290
then pls you know all together we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1616
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:11,680
know that mpls does not really support

1617
01:23:08,290 --> 01:23:14,050
so they are all kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> work around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

1618
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:18,159
thing with 16 work is being done

1619
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:20,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">supported in the future but for now you</font>

1620
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:21,730
might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider an overload</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1621
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:24,130

1622
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:27,159
multicast then you might consider an

1623
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:31,809
overlay with some that that also

1624
01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:34,500
leverage mpls like um pls Donald Fraser

1625
01:23:31,809 --> 01:23:36,810
or multicast traffic

1626
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:39,450
qsr is on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roadmap not supported at</font>

1627
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:41,490
this time beat the ends on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1628
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:48,030
hand are supported we call this feature

1629
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:51,269
6bp you have it on our routers and same

1630
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:55,080
concept it's going to be pretty much

1631
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:57,960
going to divide this big ipv6 cloud that

1632
01:23:55,080 --> 01:24:00,990
6p<font color="#E5E5E5"> put together is going to divide it</font>

1633
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:03,690
into smaller clouds that are private and

1634
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:06,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">I used for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> customers so now here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1635
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:11,370
interesting thing why in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first place</font>

1636
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:13,139
really need VPNs now right i mean these

1637
01:24:11,370 --> 01:24:15,540
six is the next thing right we have all

1638
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:17,160
the addresses in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world we don't need</font>

1639
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:20,310
private addressing you don't need to

1640
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:22,340
hide our addressing<font color="#CCCCCC"> scheme from other</font>

1641
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:24,050
etc security purposes of

1642
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:27,800
big

1643
01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:30,890
but so why do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> B ends well</font>

1644
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:33,530
we need me for the fact that we are

1645
01:24:30,890 --> 01:24:35,700
usually at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ends network</font>

1646
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:37,980
administrators are used to running

1647
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:39,750
and we still have the security problem

1648
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:41,790
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fillmore</font>

1649
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:42,960
Weeden our network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> four other people</font>

1650
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:46,560
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see them</font>

1651
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:49,590
but the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> then is</font>

1652
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,980
how do you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of this VPN right I</font>

1653
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:53,630
mean how do you get

1654
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:56,339
ipv6 VPN

1655
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:59,210
and connect with somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

1656
01:24:56,340 --> 01:24:59,210
to another network

1657
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:08,750
highest esteem casa said said we d

1658
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:08,750
you really want VPN

1659
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:15,330
but then the question now is you have

1660
01:25:13,290 --> 01:25:18,180
your VPN you have your own world how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1661
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:19,530
get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so we have EP ends now</font>

1662
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:24,280
we have to work on the next step trying

1663
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:28,150
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out of that is not being done yet</font>

1664
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:31,989
that does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense or not</font>

1665
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:34,420
so just food for thought one way one

1666
01:25:31,989 --> 01:25:36,280
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do is we'd be sick</font>

1667
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:37,530
since we support so many addresses on

1668
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:40,199
the same interface

1669
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:41,730
what you might want to do with a VPN

1670
01:25:40,199 --> 01:25:43,469
deployment

1671
01:25:41,730 --> 01:25:46,440
v6

1672
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:49,500
you might want to have to add the skins

1673
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:52,290
on your network one address<font color="#E5E5E5"> scheme that</font>

1674
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:55,620
goes out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so goes on over</font>

1675
01:25:52,290 --> 01:25:57,600
a leaky VPN out late at night and one

1676
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:59,550
addressing scheme that you use inside

1677
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:01,220
your VPN for inside your enterprise

1678
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:04,250
inside your domain

1679
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:05,810
and then you let you<font color="#E5E5E5"> let SAS to do the</font>

1680
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:08,210
job for you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully does the right</font>

1681
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:11,800
job of selecting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right source</font>

1682
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:11,800
address whenever you send the traffic

1683
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:20,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">I pretty much talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the slide as</font>

1684
01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:23,650
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see 6p has traffic for all</font>

1685
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:27,400
clouds yellow<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> green six vp instead</font>

1686
01:26:23,650 --> 01:26:30,339
yields similar type same way as in ipv6

1687
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:31,690
and ipv4 different routing table

1688
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:34,540
different polling tables and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1689
01:26:31,690 --> 01:26:37,599
so forth configuration wise if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> did I</font>

1690
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:39,070
p is equal to VPN<font color="#CCCCCC"> on our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rs6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VP is</font>

1691
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:41,740
exactly the same thing as a matter of

1692
01:26:39,070 --> 01:26:45,360
fact it was just a change in the VPN

1693
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:45,360
code to support<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1694
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:53,559
well I'm out of time so I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

1695
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:53,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">here we go</font>

1696
01:27:02,410 --> 01:27:08,170
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we notice was</font>

1697
01:27:05,670 --> 01:27:10,990
service provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sarah friends were</font>

1698
01:27:08,170 --> 01:27:13,120
interested in in using<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 for</font>

1699
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:14,620
broadband access why well because

1700
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:17,680
broadband access offers you the

1701
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:19,630
opportunity to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more money out of</font>

1702
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:22,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">your customers right you can offer them</font>

1703
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:25,930
more services like video channels audio

1704
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:29,170
channels and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth as an</font>

1705
01:27:25,930 --> 01:27:32,590
example in in Japan cable TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not such</font>

1706
01:27:29,170 --> 01:27:34,840
a popular thing so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use some of</font>

1707
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:40,860
the broadband channels to actually

1708
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:40,860
deliver hktv can speckle this

1709
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:48,880
so broadband employing I BGC seen in the

1710
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:51,280
broadband environment he got a lot of

1711
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:54,220
input so that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we decided to</font>

1712
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:58,389
actually cover this example of discuss a

1713
01:27:54,220 --> 01:28:02,860
little bit about broadband access so in

1714
01:27:58,390 --> 01:28:05,590
principle ipv6 you really need not be

1715
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:08,019
concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the layer to stop right</font>

1716
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:10,840
whether it is dsl well there is fiber to

1717
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:14,770
the home cable and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth</font>

1718
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:19,480
well things are almost true for most of

1719
01:28:14,770 --> 01:28:22,030
these access media types that's the case

1720
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:23,740
IP just practically<font color="#CCCCCC"> six on it regardless</font>

1721
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:28,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the media things are a little bit</font>

1722
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:29,380
different in cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis the kind the</font>

1723
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:32,410
conversion of dots that is being

1724
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:34,690
implement as being used is not really

1725
01:28:32,410 --> 01:28:37,750
conducive to ipv6 does not have all the

1726
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:40,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">elements necessary for the table pieces</font>

1727
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:42,940
to support ipv6 so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

1728
01:28:40,780 --> 01:28:46,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">about doing ipv6 over table right now</font>

1729
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:49,780
you're you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> best bet you're only</font>

1730
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:52,630
bad is tunneling everything else goes

1731
01:28:49,780 --> 01:28:55,830

actually salmon and colleague of ours

<font color="#CCCCCC">forth but you know you as a certified</font>

01:33:13,470 --> 01:33:18,210
might choose to take some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bits</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this slide pretty much stays what what I</font>

1822
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:42,060
just said but one thing to keep in mind

1823
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:45,370
is we'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> six we've sort of try to</font>

01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:47,950
stick to our promise that we will give

customers and address to keep for the

01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:52,330
long run not<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we'd be four we were</font>

1827
01:33:50,350 --> 01:33:54,250
so stingy and we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right here's an</font>

1828
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:56,559
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it for two hours or three</font>

1829
01:33:54,250 --> 01:34:00,150
hours then I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it back and</font>

1830
01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:03,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to reuse it so that in itself</font>

1831
01:34:00,150 --> 01:34:07,330
might help in some situation it might

1832
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:09,760
help with the with the management of the

1833
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:11,769
addressing and might help the customer

1834
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:16,590
with his configuration of the site

1835
01:34:11,770 --> 01:34:19,570
simplified but it might introduce some

1836
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:21,340
some small complications in in how you

1837
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:22,780
do things in your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> metal versus</font>

01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:26,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">respire especially when you do</font>

1839
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:30,009
aggregation to give you an example if

1840
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:32,349
you have in one of our discussions if

1841
01:34:30,010 --> 01:34:34,370
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> terminating points for your</font>

1842
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:37,460
tunnel weather

1843
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:39,140
or they are your<font color="#CCCCCC"> lttp columns and you</font>

1844
01:34:37,460 --> 01:34:43,700
have your<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer that they can connect</font>

1845
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:46,940
to any of these Ellen asses or lazard's

1846
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:50,480
right if I'm always going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave my</font>

1847
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:52,910
customer the same prefix and you can end

1848
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:56,660
up in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these routers then it's</font>

1849
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:59,240
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put holes in the prefixes that</font>

1850
01:34:56,660 --> 01:35:01,550
each router can advertise so now i'm

1851
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:05,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to have mixes of / 64th here</font>

1852
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:10,850
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able to summarize them</font>

1853
01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:12,980
too / 48 for example so policies or or

1854
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:15,020
some thought has to be putting that in

1855
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:18,709
this process we have a smallest amount

1856
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:20,300
on the drop in in this you have to you

1857
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:22,970
might want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put some policies in terms</font>

1858
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:25,220
of how customers can connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1859
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:29,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">location if this customer will always</font>

1860
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:32,480
keep the same address<font color="#E5E5E5"> but like in before</font>

1861
01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:35,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might also choose you might also</font>

1862
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:39,599
choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give your customers temporary</font>

1863
01:35:35,610 --> 01:35:41,759
in this first third example here this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1864
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:45,300
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example where my customer is doing</font>

always going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the prefix</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3ff pc00</font>

1866
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:52,280
and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to always get that</font>

1867
01:35:48,389 --> 01:35:55,850

1868
01:35:52,280 --> 01:36:01,769
but then the next few examples give you

1869
01:35:55,850 --> 01:36:04,949
some situations where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might want to</font>

1870
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:09,020

another means to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually provide</font>

01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:30,639
dynamically manage those prefixes and

1877
01:36:27,769 --> 01:36:32,780
distribute them within their network and

1878
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:36,720
that particular mechanism is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

room are familiar with it but the idea

1881
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:46,290
would be that me as a customer whether

1882
01:36:42,510 --> 01:36:48,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm a toll I have a reasonable level but</font>

1883
01:36:46,290 --> 01:36:48,830
I'm a small enterprise

1884
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:57,120
I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually go to my provider and</font>

1885
01:36:54,030 --> 01:36:59,460
dynamically ask for the prefix for my /

1886
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:02,910
48 that I'm supposedly entitled to and

1887
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:06,210
then won one time getting that / 48 I'm

1888
01:37:02,910 --> 01:37:09,260
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> intern go ahead and distribute</font>

1889
01:37:06,210 --> 01:37:12,260
it cut it up and distribute to my

<font color="#CCCCCC">internal users or my internal interfaces</font>

1891
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:18,989
so let's see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> this works let's say</font>

1892
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:23,070
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm have I have my here's my ISP</font>

formation get dns info

01:37:50,770 --> 01:37:56,850
cpe in turn talks about whatever link

1904
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:59,850

1906
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:06,669
the PT router used to play to

01:38:03,730 --> 01:38:08,339
authenticate or as a song get

1908
01:38:06,670 --> 01:38:12,960

1910
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:21,110
now first of all there is a one step

1911
01:38:15,889 --> 01:38:23,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was missed here in that TP comes up</font>

1915
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:35,009
and basically since is the sensor a pack

01:38:29,340 --> 01:38:37,920
of the request saying hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm looking</font>

1920
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:49,920
packet and authenticates talk to the

1921
01:38:48,150 --> 01:38:51,679
radius server authenticates this

1922
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:53,570
customer

1923
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:56,780
and gets on the radio the information

01:38:53,570 --> 01:39:00,518
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it needs whatever prefix it can</font>

1925
01:38:56,780 --> 01:39:00,518
hear that pasta

1926
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:08,260
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cpe router the pirata tells the</font>

1935
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:36,850
reply saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here is your prefix</font>

1936
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:39,840
that you can use a / 48 for example the

1937
01:39:36,850 --> 01:39:39,840
60 router

1938
01:39:41,210 --> 01:39:46,870
the cpe router takes a prefix that's

1939
01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:50,180
left 48 and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we cut it in pieces</font>

1940
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:53,660
however it decides<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and assigns those</font>

1941
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:56,150
pieces we own interfaces so each of each

1942
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:58,790
interface you will now get a slice of

1943
01:39:56,150 --> 01:40:01,580
that / 48 or whatever world that PVC

1944

from the ISP

1945
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:07,090

okay it's

1948

okay it starts to send out a router

1949
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:21,340
advertisement saying here's the prefix

and then it can continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:32,019
process of getting in South table while

1957
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:39,660

that def speaker

1964
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:14,530
then in turn once he got that prefix

1965
01:41:12,610 --> 01:41:17,730
he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to his own interface</font>

vcp works great

1976
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:32,940
actually it's actually it's in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

especially for customers

01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:05,780
well one of the customers that we were

each one of these for forming networks

1984
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:12,889
or you know like small business networks

1985
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:14,899
they just give them a staff 48

1986
01:43:12,889 --> 01:43:17,269
and then the customer slashes that is

left 64 and the science plastics before
