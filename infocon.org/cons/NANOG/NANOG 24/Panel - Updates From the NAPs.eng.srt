are principally about hearing although

273
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,020
there have always been a few content

274
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:52,710
players in fact is our centers are not

275
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:55,189
large enough for the huge content plays

276
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:58,260
so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone comes to us and asks for</font>

287
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:34,830
its place called waves exchange San

288
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Francisco wave exchange 200</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fall street</font>

289
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,450
it's a big fiber motel and you can get

290
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,150
packed switch ports there and in san

291
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:45,840
francisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> bay area you'll see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us grow</font>

292
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:48,270
more switches and the reason we decided

293
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,030
to go into this is that mfn has all that

294
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:53,930
fiber in<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in those metros the</font>

295
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:58,410
internal transfer costs is pretty low so

296
00:14:53,930 --> 00:15:00,150
if you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what axes switch ports are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

297
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:03,360
can only say that they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> change just</font>

298
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:05,250
because we have you know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> Metro</font>

299
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,370
connectivity to pay for because I don't

300
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:10,680
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything the switchport</font>

301
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost outside</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our centers will be</font>

302
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">lower if it's different it'll be lower</font>

303
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:17,910
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason is I don't have to</font>

304
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:20,820
subsidize my Colo with those particular

305
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:24,000
ports so that will make<font color="#CCCCCC"> us different</font>

306
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:29,780
from any metro ethernet play that isn't

307
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">mfn or otherwise laden with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Metro fiber</font>

308
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:35,370
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently announced that we are</font>

309
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,310
interconnected with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seattle internet</font>

310
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:40,620
exchange so those of you who were in the

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:43,109
Western building connected to the six

312
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:46,370

314
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:52,560
interconnection of layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> two clouds is</font>

315
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,750
very dangerous some of you know that axe

316
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,260
does not permit customers to attach

317
00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:01,020
switches to our switches and that's just

318
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:04,710
based on how painful it is when that

319
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:06,990
the configuration<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes long so in order</font>

320
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:09,300
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected to the Seattle internet</font>

there's no spanning-tree there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac</font>

00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:18,390
learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no nothing so in order</font>

324
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:20,280
to get connectivity across that trunk

325
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:22,590
you have to sign a piece of paper that

326
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:25,310
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> your mac address on it and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

327
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:27,600
that into a static forwarding table and

328
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:30,989
we believe we're pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe from the</font>

329
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,420
kind of meltdowns that have plagued the

layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> two peering fabrics that do permit</font>

switches to be plugged into their

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,920

I<font color="#E5E5E5"> signed a Memorandum of Understanding</font>

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:51,930
New York switching fabric so we'll have

336
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:54,540
that up for you just as soon as I can

find the find a strand assignment<font color="#CCCCCC"> man</font>

338
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,969
because I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> mfn has plenty of strands</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it's just a question of finding that</font>

person and getting them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> allocate me a</font>

342
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:11,190

343
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,810
tonight to talk about the user sort of

344
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:16,470
anything else folks want to discuss i

345
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:19,079
will add one comment when someone asks

346
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:21,750
the previous presenter what is the

347
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:23,879
difference between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next-gen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peering</font>

348
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,709
initiative races<font color="#CCCCCC"> of leavin apps and what</font>

349
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,090
is the actual fundamental technical

350
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:31,830
difference and to me the difference is

351
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:34,379
something that was taxes original

352
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:36,689
distinction if you'll recall<font color="#CCCCCC"> when tax</font>

353
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,360
was first brought to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to market a lot of</font>

354
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">people ask me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jeep all there are already</font>

355
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,129
two or three other naps in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Area</font>

356
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,050
why do we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> another the answer is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

357
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,330
were not an app this was not a network

358
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:51,330
play this was a combined Colo<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

359
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,220
network play and so if you're on a

360
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,780
switch or you know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in</font>

361
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ethernet switch in the same building</font>

362
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,820
with you or an ATM switch that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> over in</font>

363
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:02,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">san ramon whatever it is when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your trunk</font>

364
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,409
too thats which fills up unless you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

365
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the same building with the other</font>

366
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,310
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that switch you're probably</font>

367
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:11,610
just out of Law

368
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:14,730
so in a tax or in these<font color="#CCCCCC"> message on</font>

369
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:17,250
hearing centers the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the</font>

370
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:20,580
TNI we've got dark fiber between you and

371
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,320
the other people so if either one of you

372
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,570
fills up your connection to the switch

373
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,570
it's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> big deal so you've already paid</font>

374
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,070
the exchanger<font color="#CCCCCC"> network there and so that</font>

375
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,740
to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the distinction in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

376
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:33,510
traditional nap you had no<font color="#CCCCCC"> kien</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i bypass</font>

that you could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you soldier this</font>

378
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:39,950
was poor it's my presentation high

379
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,949
school

380
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:49,190

I put the presentation together we had

59 sign customers is actually added a

00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:08,060
to additional buildings based on demand

594
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,650
in some ways it's actually become more

595
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,780
difficult in some metro areas to get

<font color="#E5E5E5">fiber some of the fiber companies want</font>

00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,410
but in some metro area if there are a

where there's an ATM based platform so

one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at is</font>

621
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:30,810
involving the platform to the frame

00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,850
provisioning with the frame handoff is

629
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,680
pretty straightforward you're not

630

exchanging routing feel it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty</font>

a pretty similar hand off ATM very clear

exchanged obviously over that type of an

over time without changing the handoff

00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:46,159
of the architecture talk about current

711
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:48,350
service models that were offering and

712
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,350
new service models that are under

713
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:55,790
development and will be quickly deployed

714
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:57,920
I know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last 9 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 months has been</font>

715
00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:00,170
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult for telecom industry in</font>

716
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,690
general but we look back even three

717
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:05,840
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago from today has been tremendous</font>

718
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:09,170
pressure in terms of bandwidth a team

719
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:12,290
one from New York to<font color="#CCCCCC"> LA has decreased in</font>

720
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:14,560
and wrote eroded in price some forty to

00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:17,660
sixty percent over the last three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

722
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,460
so carriers and operators those who are

<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to provide bandwidth services</font>

725
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:28,340
consistent erosion that<font color="#CCCCCC"> really calls for</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the ability to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next-generation</font>

728
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:38,089
you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traditional metro area</font>

00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:11,500
the current generation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

738

in the south southeast florida area

the current constraints on network

currently we're certainly not installing

much ds3 these days it's still doing a

856
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:10,670
lot of OC 3 and definitely substantial

857
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:12,980
amount of OC 12 and and certainly there

858
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:16,010
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> great impetus to move to a next</font>

generation and and clearly that the more

860
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:23,450
exciting area to focus on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do want</font>

00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:27,259
and the ameritech nap or

863
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:29,210
doing quite well we had over twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font>

economic condition so there's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

866
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:37,098
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of demand and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly the size of</font>

867
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,619
the customer bases is a factor far as

868
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:42,079
busy our throughput up ameritech is at

869
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:43,760
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> six and a half gig back valid</font>

00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:52,460
of the PVC deployment and ameritech when

<font color="#E5E5E5">a new customer signs on or is installed</font>

874
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:57,680
we have an automated script that builds

875
00:43:55,099 --> 00:44:00,079
a full mesh of PVC to every<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

876
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,328

877
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:05,450
to do is form a bilateral peering

00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,410
that in the routers enable it and

881
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,020
they're set to go impact felt we have a

882
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:17,180
more of a customized approach where we

we're doing but one of the specific

things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was exploring was</font>

replicating what we do in America<font color="#CCCCCC"> impact</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">felt so we would build a full mesh of</font>

platform the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgx platform has some</font>

1047
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:53,030
limitations that would make that

1048
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:55,700
difficult we plan to evolve the path set

1049
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:57,650
and address that issue and really the

1050
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:59,450
issue is that in America<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we do it</font>

1051
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:03,550
through an automated script so we can

1052
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:06,710
build 160 PVCs in about half an hour

1053
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:10,340
that was where the problem arose on the

1054
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:12,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">path outside that the pistol and measure</font>

1055
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:15,710
some limitations that wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1056
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:19,220
allow that but again<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know which</font>

1057
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:20,900
clearly we are provisioning and interval

1058
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:24,350
issues but we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> making a concerted</font>

1059
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:27,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">effort to minimize that interval and</font>

again at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least the flip side or upside</font>

1061
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:32,720
of it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a personal contact</font>

1062

to help with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that individual</font>

1063
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:39,080
provisioning on an as-needed basis so

1064
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:41,540
the merger with ameritech at least we'll

1065
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,370
give you some tools to leverage to

1066
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:46,700
replicate that goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely i mean</font>

1067
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:48,680
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a wealth of experience on the</font>

1068
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:51,439
provisioning side soon in an automated

1069
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:54,529
fashion and clearly this is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

1070
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,300
under one group so for example the chain

00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:59,050
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> command is such that are not</font>

operations tier two support it's one

1073
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:04,340
organization and clearly their internal

1074
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:06,140
efficiencies to be gained but there's

1075
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:10,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely advantages for our customer</font>

1076
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:12,350
base<font color="#CCCCCC"> too I guess the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one that the same</font>

1077
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">lines I was curious if folks on the</font>

1078
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:18,220
panel have had any traction with

1079
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:18,220
multilateral sharing agreements

1080
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:28,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">while speaking for pax we don't have one</font>

1081
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:30,610
the reason being we want to give our

1082
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,700
participants freedom to not fear if

1083
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:37,740
that's what they want to not do dick

1084
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:41,230
ality is from freedom in both directions

1085
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:43,479
speaking for kicks which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> offer it for</font>

1086
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:45,580
some years I can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you than fel eyes</font>

1087
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:49,600
don't work and don't do what you think

1088

they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do at the dem a service</font>

1089
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,950
that we specifically don't have a

it'd be a chance for any operators were

00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:28,789
the present here today that didn't get a

1101
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,710
chance to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up to the panel to come</font>

1102
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:34,420
up and say hi say a few things about

themselves hopefully we'll have an LCD

1104

<font color="#E5E5E5">we do want to go in and go off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1106
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:44,150
scribble things of town it's also a

1107
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:45,769
chance for you guys to actually only the

operator to the exchanges where you're

1109
00:55:45,769 --> 00:55:49,459
participating now or may want to

1110
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:51,740
participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> future and Ashley ask</font>

four questions one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things a lot</font>

people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in touch with the</font>

1115
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:04,640
people that really win the mountain too

1116
00:56:03,049 --> 00:56:06,140
often enough and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1117
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:08,690
hopefully the people chance to do this

1118
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:13,848
and hopefully some other presentations

1119
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:15,769
as well already<font color="#E5E5E5"> has unsuspected but</font>

1120
00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:18,109
really it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this your session so</font>

1121

there and we'll go to the bar later
